## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000209"></a>
The comparison is used to find out whether translation errors occurred between two languages:

- same text in both languages.

- messages not translated in one of the languages.




The comparison file is created in the reference language. The comparison file and the extraction file have the same format (WDMSG file, HFSQL data file or text file). For more details on the format of the comparison text file, see [format of text files of messages](../WDMsg/3518030.md)

If this file is in text format, it can be handled by [WDTRAD](../WDTrad/3518010.md) or by another translation software like an extraction file.
If this file is in HFSQL format or in WDMSG format, it can be handled by [WDTRAD](../WDTrad/3518010.md) only. 

This comparison file contains:

- the messages identical in both languages.

- the messages only displayed in the reference language.




The comparison file can be reintegrated once the modifications have been made. This reintegration is done in the same way as for the extraction file.

**Remark**: This file can be empty if no translation inconsistency was detected.

### Comparing the project messages
<a name="comparing_the_project_messages_ELTPARAGRAPHE000045"></a>

To compare the messages of your project: 

1. Open your project in WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile: on the "Home" tab, in the "General" group, expand "Open" and select "Open a project".

2. Start WDMSG: on the "Project" tab, in the "Translate" group, expand "Translate" and select "List of untranslated messages". The message comparison wizard starts. 

3. Choose the reference language. The different messages will be displayed in this reference language. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Assistant%20WDMSG%20-%20HC%20N%B0007.gif&type=thumb)
Remark: The name of custom languages is also proposed. 

4. Go to the next step of the wizard.

5. Choose the language to compare. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Assistant%20WDMSG%20-%20HC%20N%B0008.gif&type=thumb)
Remark: The name of custom languages is also proposed.
	The comparison file will contain the messages:

	- that are identical in the reference language and in the language to compare.

	- that only exist in the language to compare.




6. Go to the next step.  

7. Select the different elements (windows, pages, reports, ...) whose messages (caption, code message, ...) must be compared. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Assistant%20WDMSG%20-%20HC%20N%B0009.gif&type=thumb)


8. Go to the next step.

9. Choose the type of file to generate: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Assistant%20WDMSG%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.gif&type=thumb)


	- WDMSG archive. This type of file can only be used to translate text with WDTRAD. 

- HFSQL file. This type of file can only be used to translate text with WDTRAD.  

- Text file. This type of file can be used to perform a translation with WDTRAD or with another translation software. 

10. Go to the next step.

11. Select the different parameters of comparison file (these parameters are presented below). These parameters are the same as the ones used for a simple extraction. Your file can be reintegrated after being corrected.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Assistant%20WDMSG%20-%20HC%20N%B0010.gif&type=thumb)


12. Go to the next step.

13. Validate. The comparison file is created in the selected directory (project directory by default). This file can be translated with a specific translation software (text format only) or with [WDTRAD](../WDTrad/3518010.md), the translation tool supplied with WDMSG.




**Remarks**: 

- This comparison file may be empty if no messages correspond to the comparison.

- For a comparison in the format of data files in HFSQL format, 3 files are included in the comparison file: 

	- data file (.fic),

	- index file (.ndx),

	- memo file (.mmo).

### Comparison parameters
<a name="comparison_parameters_ELTPARAGRAPHE000120"></a>

The extraction parameters common to all extraction file types are as follows:

- **Keep the hotkey indicator ("&") in the extracted messages**: this parameter allows you to include the "&" character in the captions of controls to specify the control hotkey.
	Reminder: This hotkey is used to directly position on the control at runtime by pressing Alt + Letter. In the control caption, any letter preceded by the "&" character automatically becomes the control "hotkey".

- **Convert to OEM format (ANSI by default)**: if this option is enabled, the extraction file will use OEM characters (DOS character set, usable with a DOS software). Otherwise, ANSI characters will be used (Windows character set, usable with a Windows software).




You can also define parameters specific to your own translation software (see next paragraph).

### Comparison parameters for a translation software
<a name="comparison_parameters_for_translation_software_ELTPARAGRAPHE000136"></a>

The following parameters are not required if you are using [WDTRAD](../WDTrad/3518010.md) to translate the messages found in your project.

If you are using another translation software, specific parameters must be defined (these parameters may differ according to the software used). The parameters specific to the translation software used are as follows:

- **Add a delimiter for the text sections not to translate**: with some translation software, sections of text can be ignored in the document to translate. For example, the comments generated by WDMSG can be ignored. To do so, the text sections to ignore must be enclosed in delimiters (specific to the software).
	If this option is enabled, all the sections of text specific to the format of the extraction file will be enclosed in delimiters (SSTRX by default) and they will not be translated.
	For more details, see the documentation about the translation software.

- **Add a space before the delimiter**: with some translation software, a space must be added before the delimiter. 
	If this option is enabled, a space character is added before the delimiter.

- **Add a space after the delimiter**: with some translation software, a space character must be added after the delimiter. 
	If this option is enabled, a space character is added after the delimiter.

- **Add additional information as comments**: if this option is enabled, comment lines will be added into the created extraction file. These lines are used to find out the origin of messages (messages associated with a control, a window, ...).
