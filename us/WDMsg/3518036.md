### Extracting the text of the project
<a name="extracting_the_text_the_project_ELTPARAGRAPHE000047"></a>

To extract the text of the project:

1. Open your project in WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile: on the "Home" tab, in the "General" group, expand "Open" and select "Open a project".
	Remark: To extract all resources from a project in a WINDEV configuration that includes WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile, open the project in this WINDEV configuration. 

2. Start WDMSG: on the "Project" tab, in the "Translate" group, expand "Translate" and select "Extract messages".

3. Select the languages of the text to be extracted. These languages correspond to the languages already available in the project, to be translated into other languages. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Assistant%20WDMSG%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif&type=thumb)
The languages that appear in the list are those defined in the "Languages" tab of the project description. 
	Remarks: 

	- The names of the custom languages also appear in the list. 

	- To open the project description, go to the "Project" tab, "Project" group and click "Description".

	- To select multiple languages, press Ctrl and/or Shift.




4. Go to the next step of the wizard.

5. If you select multiple languages, specify the source language, i.e. the language used during the development phase. The text in the source language is to be translated into other languages. 

6. Go to the next step of the wizard.  

7. Select the elements (windows, pages, reports, etc.) that contain the text to be extracted (captions, code comments, etc.). <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Assistant%20WDMSG%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif&type=thumb)
Remarks: 

	- You can select only non-translated or non-corrected elements in the selected language.
			To easily find the elements to be extracted, enter the name of the desired element and start the search.

	- If the elements of your project are grouped by custom-folders, the elements suggested by WDMSG will also be grouped by custom-folders.




8. Go to the next step.

9. Choose the type of file to be generated: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Assistant%20WDMSG%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.gif&type=thumb)


	- WDMSG archive. This type of file can only be used to translate text with WDTRAD. 

- HFSQL file. This type of file can only be used to translate text with WDTRAD.  

- Text file. This type of file can be used to translate with WDTRAD or with another translation software. 

10. Go to the next step.

11. Select the options of the file to be generated (see [Details of parameters](#NOTE2_2)). Specify the name and directory of the extraction file (by default, it is created in the directory of the current project). <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Assistant%20WDMSG%20-%20HC%20N%B0004.gif&type=thumb)


12. Go to the next step.

13. When extracting text, you can check whether the text of the current project matches previously extracted text. For more details, see [Extracting modified text](../WDMsg/3518033.md). 

14. Go to the next step.

15. Validate.




The extraction file is created in the selected directory (project directory by default). It is recommended to make a backup copy of the extraction file. This backup copy will be used to:

- retrieve the extraction file format (for example, if the keywords of this file are inadvertently changed).

- compare the extracted text with the text of the current project (when reintegrating the text).




The extracted file can be translated: 

- using a specific translation software (text files only). 

- using [WDTRAD](../WDTrad/3518010.md), translation tool provided with WDMSG.




**Remarks**: 

- To extract resources in HFSQL format, 3 files are created: 

	- data file (.fic).

	- index file (.ndx).

	- memo file (.mmo).




- Multilingual extraction: When extracting multilingual resources: 

	- in text format, a file is generated for each language. 

	- in HFSQL or WDMSG format, a single file containing the different languages is generated.

### Extraction options
<a name="extraction_options_ELTPARAGRAPHE000167"></a>

The extraction options common to all file types are as follows:

- **Keep the hotkey indicator ("&") in the extracted messages**: this option includes the "&" character in the captions of controls to assign the hotkey.
	Reminder: At runtime, the hotkey sets the position directly on the control by pressing Alt + the corresponding letter. In the control caption, any letter preceded by the "&" character automatically becomes the control "hotkey".

- **Convert hard-coded strings to multilingual strings**: There are two types of character strings in the code:

	- *multilingual strings*. An icon appears next to the strings:<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=MessageMultilangue.gif)


	- *non-multilingual ("hard coded") strings*. These strings are enclosed in quotes.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=MessageNonMultilangue.gif)

- **Convert to OEM format (ANSI by default)**: if this option is enabled, the extraction file will use OEM characters (DOS character set, can be used with a DOS software). Otherwise, ANSI characters will be used (Windows character set, can be used with a Windows software).




You can also define options specific to the translation software used (see next paragraph).
<a name="NOTE2_3"></a>


### Extraction options for a translation software
<a name="extraction_options_for_translation_software_ELTPARAGRAPHE000194"></a>

The following options are not required if you are using [WDTRAD](../WDTrad/3518010.md) to translate the text of your project.

If you use another translation software, you need to define specific options (these options may vary depending on the software used). The options to be defined based on the translation software used are as follows:

- **Add a delimiter for the text sections not to translate**: with some translation software, sections of text can be ignored in the document to translate. For example, the comments generated by WDMSG can be ignored. To do so, the text sections to ignore must be enclosed in delimiters (specific to the software).
	If this option is enabled, all the sections of text specific to the format of the extraction file will be enclosed in delimiters (SSTRX by default) and will not be translated.
	For more details on delimiters, see the documentation of the translation software used.

- **Add a space before the delimiter**: with some translation software, a space must be added before the delimiter. 
	If this option is enabled, a space is added before the delimiter.

- **Add a space after the delimiter**: with some translation software, a space must be added after the delimiter. 
	If this option is enabled, a space is added after the delimiter.

- **Add additional information as comments**: if this option is enabled, comment lines will be added to the extraction file. These comments indicate the origin of the text (text from a control, window, etc.).

### Format of the content in the text file
<a name="format_the_content_the_text_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000223"></a>

The extraction file created with WDMSG uses a specific format. For more details, see [format of the content in the text file](../WDMsg/3518030.md).

### Project in multiple IDEs
<a name="project_multiple_ides_ELTPARAGRAPHE000233"></a>

If the current project is configured for multi IDEs (WINDEV, WEBDEV and/or WINDEV Mobile):

- when extracting text from a project in a WINDEV configuration that includes WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile, all the elements of the different IDEs are taken into account.
	For example, windows and pages are extracted from a project in a WINDEV configuration that includes WEBDEV.

- when reintegrating text into a project in a WINDEV configuration that includes WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile, all the elements of the different IDEs are taken into account.
