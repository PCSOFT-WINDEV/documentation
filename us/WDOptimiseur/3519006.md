## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000120"></a>
WDOptimizer is used to:

- Cancel a transaction.

- Free records from a transaction.




**Reminder**: A transaction is used to make sure that the updates performed on one or more data files have successfully completed. If an error or an incident (power outage for example) occurs during transaction operations, WDOptimizer automatically restores the files to their initial status (before the beginning of transaction).

**Remark**: WDTrans can also be used to cancel a transaction and/or to free the records from a transaction.

## Canceling the operations performed on a transaction file
<a name="canceling_the_operations_performed_transaction_file_ELTTEXTE000144"></a>
When canceling the operations performed on a transaction file:

- **If a transaction is in progress**, WDOptimizer cancels all the operations performed on the files in transaction since the beginning of the transaction. In this case, the transaction is canceled without interrupting the program execution.

- **If no transaction is in progress**, WDOptimizer restores the integrity of the database and cancels the unsuccessful transaction (power failure for example).

## Freeing records from a transaction
<a name="freeing_records_from_transaction_ELTTEXTE000174"></a>
Freeing records from a transaction is used to transform all the records "in transaction" into "standard" records (if these records do not belong to the transaction in progress). If a record found in the specified data file is considered as being in transaction but does not belong to a transaction in progress, it is automatically freed.

**Caution**: This feature is an advanced feature. This feature must be used when it is not possible to cancel the transactions that have failed (deleted transaction files for example).

3. Select the directory containing the data file currently in transaction.
	**Caution**: No transaction file must be found in this directory. The list of data files found in the directory is displayed.
	**Remark**: Check "Include the files found in all the sub-directories" if data files are located in the sub-directories.

4. If some data files are password protected, specify the password. Indeed, this password is required to free the records in transaction.

5. Click the "Free all the records in transaction" button. The records are freed.
