## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000147"></a>
By default, a single row can be selected in a Table control. However, the Table control can be configured in order to become multi-selection. In this case, the user will have the ability to select several rows and to retrieve these rows through programming.

The "Multiple" row selection mode can be selected in the "UI" tab of the control description window.

Multi-selection can be performed via the standard Shift and Ctrl keys, the arrows and/or the mouse.

Then, 3 methods can be used to retrieve the selected rows: 

- [Browsing rows and using the TableSelect function](#NOTE2_1). 

- [Browsing the selected rows via the FOR EACH statement](#NOTE3_1). 

- [Using a Check Box column](#NOTE4_1).

## Method 1: Using the TableSelect function
<a name="method_1_using_the_tableselect_function_ELTTEXTE000171"></a>
This method consists in performing a browse loop and in browsing rows with [TableSelect](../WDLang1/3074020.md). 

A variable representing the rank of the selected list will be incremented from the value 1. 

- If [TableSelect](../WDLang1/3074020.md) returns -1: there is no other selected rows.

- If [TableSelect](../WDLang1/3074020.md) returns a value greater than 0: this value represents the position of the selected row in the Table control.




To retrieve the value of the selected element, use the following syntax: 


```txt
NameTableControl.ColumnName[Subscript]
```


Note: To find out the number of selected rows, use [TableSelectCount](../WDLang1/3074030.md). This allows you to perform a loop with a [FOR](../Motscles/1510001.md) statement instead of a [WHILE](../Motscles/1510010.md) statement.


### Example
<a name="example_ELTPARAGRAPHE000064"></a>


```wl
Rank is int
RowPosition is int
ColumnValue is string

Rank = 1
RowPosition = TableSelect(NameTableControl, Rank)
WHILE RowPosition <>-1
	ElementValue = NameTableControl.ColumnName[RowPosition]
	Rank++
	RowPosition = TableSelect(NameTableControl, Rank)
END
```

<a name="NOTE3_1"></a>


## Method 2: Using the FOR EACH statement
<a name="method_2_using_the_for_each_statement_ELTTEXTE000201"></a>
This method consists in browsing the selected rows with a specific [FOR EACH](../Motscles/1510017.md) statement. 


### Example
<a name="example_ELTPARAGRAPHE000079"></a>


```wl
FOR EACH SELECTED ROW OF NameTableControl
	// Process the selected row
END
```


<a name="NOTE4"></a>
<a name="NOTE4_1"></a>


## Method 3: Using a Check Box column
<a name="method_3_using_check_box_column_ELTTEXTE000231"></a>
Instead of using the multi-selection mechanism of the Table control, it is possible to use a Check Box column to manage the selection. This column must be in edit in the Table control. 

In this case:

- if the box found in the check box is checked, the row is selected. 

- if the box is not checked, the row is not selected.




All you have to do is browse all the rows found in the Table control and check whether the box is checked for each row.


### Code example
<a name="code_example_ELTPARAGRAPHE000098"></a>


```wl
Sub is int

FOR Sub = 1 TO TableCount(NameTableControl)
	IF NameTableControl.Col_CheckBox[Sub] = True then
		// Process the selected row
	END

END
```
