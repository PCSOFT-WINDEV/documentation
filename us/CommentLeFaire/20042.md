<a name="NOTE1"></a>
<a name="NOTE1_1"></a>
To count records in a data file, you have the ability to perform a browse loop and to increment an Integer variable. 

The best method to perform this count consists in using an SQL query.

Let's see how to perform a count by using: 

- [Method 1: an SQL query created with the query editor](#NOTE2_1).

	- [SQL count query on the entire data file](#NOTE2_1). 

	- [SQL count query on a grouping](#NOTE3_1). 




- [Method 2: a query created through programming](#NOTE4_1).

<a name="NOTE2_1"></a>


## SQL count query on the entire data file
<a name="sql_count_query_the_entire_data_file_ELTTEXTE000189"></a>
This count query is used to count all the records found in a data file. The images present the count of all records found in CUSTOMER file.

The different steps for creating this SQL count query are as follows: 

1. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_nouveau.gif) in the quick access buttons. 

	- In the window that is displayed, click "Queries". 

	- The query creation wizard starts.




2. Specify that you want to create a select query ("Select" option). <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CLF_Requete_Comptage%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif&type=thumb)

	Go to the next step of the wizard.

3. The query description window appears.

4. Give a name and a caption to the query: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CLF_Requete_Comptage%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif&type=thumb)


5. Choose an item (identifier for example) in the data file where the count will be performed. 

6. Add this item to the list of query items.   <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CLF_Requete_Comptage%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.gif)


7. In the right section of the editor, click the "Count" button. In the menu that is displayed, select "Count on the selected item": <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CLF_Requete_Comptage%20-%20HC%20N%B0004.gif)
The following window is displayed: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CLF_Requete_Comptage%20-%20HC%20N%B0005.gif&type=thumb)


8. Validate. The query description window is updated: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CLF_Requete_comptage%20-%20HC%20N%B0006.gif)


9. Validate the query description window. The query is displayed in the editor: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CLF_Requete_comptage%20-%20HC%20N%B0007.gif)


10. Save the query (Ctrl + S). 

11. Press F2 to see the SQL code: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CLF_Requ%EAte_comptage%20-%20HC%20N%B0008.gif)


12. Run the query test (GO in the quick access buttons). 

13. The query can be run in the program by [HExecuteQuery](../WDLang4/3044080.md).

## SQL count query on a grouping
<a name="sql_count_query_grouping_ELTTEXTE000213"></a>
You have the ability to create a query that counts records according to a group criterion. 

In this example, we are going to count the number of customers per state.

The steps for creating a Count query on a grouping are as follows: 

1. Create a Count query (see previous paragraph)

2. In the data file, select the item that will be used as group argument. In our example, we are going to choose the zip code.

3. Add this item to the query items (double-click the item name for example). <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CLF_Requete_comptage%20-%20HC%20N%B0009.gif)


4. We are going to add a new action to perform a grouping on the state only. In the right section of the description window, click "Year, state" and select "State". <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CLF_Requete_comptage%20-%20HC%20N%B0010.gif)
The following window is displayed: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CLF_Requete_comptage%20-%20HC%20N%B0011.gif)


5. Validate. The query description window is updated: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CLF_Requete_comptage%20-%20HC%20N%B0012.gif)


6. Validate the query description window. The query is displayed in the editor: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CLF_Requete_comptage%20-%20HC%20N%B0013.gif)


7. Save the query (Ctrl + S). 

8. Press F2 to see the SQL code: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CLF_Requ%EAte_comptage%20-%20HC%20N%B0014.gif)


9. Run the query test (GO in the quick access buttons). 

10. The query can be run in the program by [HExecuteQuery](../WDLang4/3044080.md).

## SQL count query on a grouping through programming
<a name="sql_count_query_grouping_through_programming_ELTTEXTE000237"></a>
The SQL queries can be directly written through programming in the code. To do so, you must: 

1. Create a Data Source variable to represent the query at runtime

2. Create a Character String variable to contain the SQL code and write the SQL code in this variable

3. Run the SQL query with [HExecuteSQLQuery](../WDLang4/3044084.md)

4. Browse the result with the HReadXXX functions.




**Code sample**


```wl
Src1 is Data Source
sSQLCode is string

// Counts the number of orders by payment type
sSQLCode = [
SELECT PAYMENT.PaymentCap, COUNT(ORDER.OrderID) AS NumberOrders
FROM ORDER, PAYMENT
WHERE ORDER.PaymentID=PAYMENT.PaymentID
GROUP BY PaymentCap
]

HExecuteSQLQuery(Src1, hQueryDefault, sSQLCode)
FOR EACH Src1
	TRACE(Src1.PaymentCap, Src1.NumberOrders)
END
```
