<a name="NOTE0"></a>
<a name="NOTE0_1"></a>
A structure is a type of variable made of other variables. 

For example, an "Address" variable can be made of:

- Name of my company

- Name of contact

- Address

- Zip code

- City

- Country




This allows you to pass as parameter to a procedure a variable created from a structure instead of passing as many parametes as the number of elements found in the structure.







<a name="NOTE1"></a>
<a name="NOTE1_1"></a>


## Declaring a structure
<a name="declaring_structure_ELTTEXTE000132"></a>
To declare a structure, use the following syntax: 


```txt
StructureName is structure
	Member1 is <type of variable>
	Member2 is <type of variable>
	...
END
```


For example: 


```wl
stAddress is structure
	CompanyName is string
	ContactName is string
	Address is string
	PostalCode is string
	City is string
	Country is string
END
```


<a name="NOTE2"></a>
<a name="NOTE2_1"></a>


## Using a structure
<a name="using_structure_ELTTEXTE000156"></a>
To use an existing structure, you must:

1. Declare a variable (same type as the structure). 

2. Initialize the members taking part in the structure. 




For example: 


```wl
stAddress is structure
	CompanyName is string
	ContactName is string
	Address is string
	PostalCode is string
	City is string
	Country is string
END

ACustomer is stAddress

ACustomer.CompanyName = "PC SOFT"
ACustomer.ContactName = "Paul Doe"
ACustomer.Address = "3 Rue Puech Villa"
ACustomer.ZipCode = "34000"
ACustomer.City = "Montpellier"
ACustomer.Country = "FRANCE"
```


**Remarks**
The structures can be declared:

- in the project code (structure global to the entire project). 

- in the code of a window or page (structure global to the window or page). 

- in any process (structure local to the process).
