To filter (or select) records coming from a data file, you have the ability to perform a browse loop and to use [HFilter](../WDLang4/3044100.md). 

The best method to perform this filter (or selection) consists in using an SQL query.

Let's see how to perform a filter by using: 

- [an SQL query created with the query editor](#NOTE2_1).

- [a query created through programming](#NOTE3_1).

<a name="NOTE2_1"></a>


## SQL query with a selection of file records
<a name="sql_query_with_selection_file_records_ELTTEXTE000168"></a>
This query is used to select the file records corresponding to a selection condition. 

In this example, we want to select the records whose city is equal to a specific parameter from CUSTOMER file.

The steps for creating this SQL query with filter are as follows: 

1. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_nouveau.gif) in the quick access buttons. 

	- In the window that is displayed, click "Queries". 

	- The query creation wizard starts.




2. Specify that you want to create a select query ("Select" option). <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CLF_Requ%EAte_Somme%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif&type=thumb)
]
	Go to the next step of the wizard.

3. The query description window appears.

4. Give a name and a caption to the query: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CLF_Requ%EAte_Filtre%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif&type=thumb)


5. In the left section of the description window, choose the file items that will be used (in our example, the CUSTOMER file and the CustomerName, Company and City items). 

6. Double-click the names of the items to add them to the list of query items: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CLF_Requ%EAte_Filtre%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.gif)


7. To apply the filter (selection), click "Selection condition" in the right section of the editor.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CLF_Requ%EAte_Filtre%20-%20HC%20N%B0004.gif)


8. Click "New condition...". 

9. In the window that appears: 

	- Select the operation ("is equal" in our example).

	- Select "Parameter" to be able to pass the value typed by the user to the query.

	- Give a name to the parameter. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CLF_Requ%EAte_Filtre%20-%20HC%20N%B0005.gif)





10. Validate. The query description window is updated: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CLF_Requ%EAte_Filtre%20-%20HC%20N%B0006.gif)


11. Validate the query description window. The query is displayed in the editor: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CLF_Requ%EAte_Filtre%20-%20HC%20N%B0007.gif)


12. Save the query (Ctrl + S). 

13. Press F2 to see the SQL code: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CLF_Requ%EAte_Filtre%20-%20HC%20N%B0008.gif)


14. Run the query test (GO in the quick access buttons). 

15. The query can be run in the program by [HExecuteQuery](../WDLang4/3044080.md). The expected parameter(s) must be initialized in the code. 

16. Example of call from a button click: 
	
	```wl
	QRY_Filter.ParamCity = "Paris"
	HExecuteQuery(QRY_Filter)
	```

## SQL query with filter through programming
<a name="sql_query_with_filter_through_programming_ELTTEXTE000192"></a>
The SQL queries can be directly written through programming in the WLanguage code. To do so, you must: 

1. Create a variable of type [Data source](../WDLang4/1514053.md) to represent the query at runtime. 

2. Create a Character String variable to contain the SQL code of the query and write the SQL code in this variable. 

3. Run the SQL query with [HExecuteSQLQuery](../WDLang4/3044084.md).

4. Browse the result with the HReadXXX functions.




Code example: 


```wl
Src1 is Data Source
sSQLCode is string

// Select the products whose price is greater than ...
sSQLCode = [
SELECT PRODUCT.Reference AS Reference,	
	PRODUCT.ProdCap AS ProdCap,	
	PRODUCT.Pricebt AS Pricebt
FROM PRODUCT
WHERE PRODUCT.Pricebt > %1
]

cyPrice is currency
cyPrice = EDT_PRICE // value coming from an edit control

sSQLCode = StringBuild(sSQLCode, cyPrice)

HExecuteSQLQuery(Src1, hQueryDefault, sSQLCode)
FOR EACH Src1
	TRACE(Src1.Reference , Src1.ProdCap, Src1.Pricebt)

END
```
