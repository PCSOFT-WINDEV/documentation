## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000107"></a>
To browse the files found in a directory, you must use [fListFile](../WDLang1/3036058.md). This function is used to:

- list all the files found in a directory and in its sub-directories.

- list the files found in a directory without going into the sub-directories.

- list the files with a filter (extension and/or name).




Two methods are available: 

- [Method 1: Retrieving the list of files directly](#NOTE2_1).

- [Method 2: Using a procedure to process each file independently](#NOTE3_1).

## Method 1: Retrieving the list of files directly
<a name="method_1_retrieving_the_list_files_directly_ELTTEXTE000131"></a>
To directly retrieve the list of files: 

1. Retrieve in a character string the list of all files by using [fListFile](../WDLang1/3036058.md). 

2. Browse the retrieved string in a loop. Each file is separated by a CR character. 

3. Process each file found. 




Code example: 


```wl
sFileList is string
sFile is string

sFileList = fListFile("C:\TEMP\*.DOC")

FOR EACH STRING sFile OF sFileList SEPARATED BY CR
	// Process the sFile file
	// the sFile variable contains the name of file to process

END
```


<a name="NOTE3"></a>
<a name="NOTE3_1"></a>


## Method 2: Using a "Callback" procedure to process each file independently
<a name="method_2_using_callback_procedure_process_each_file_independently_ELTTEXTE000155"></a>
To process each listed file independently via a WLanguage procedure: 

1. Create a local or internal procedure to process each file found. 

2. Browse the list of all files by using [fListFile](../WDLang1/3036058.md) associated with the procedure that was created beforehand.




Code example: 


```wl
INTERNAL PROCEDURE pProcessFile(sDir, sFile)
	// Process the file found
	// The sDir variable contains the file directory
	// The sFile variable contains the name of the file
	TRACE(sDir, sFile)
END

fListFile("C:\TEMP\*.DOC", pProcessFile)
```
