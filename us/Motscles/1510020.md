Element used. The following elements can be used: 

- the controls,

- the HFSQL files,

- the data sources,

- the advanced types (Record, xmlNode, ...),

- the structures,

- the classes,

- the .NET objects and the Windows Store app objects.

<a name="NOTE0_1"></a>

## Remarks




### Nesting
<a name="nesting_ELTPARAGRAPHE000066"></a>

The WITH blocks can be nested. However, the element on which the accesses to the sub-elements, properties or members are performed is always the element of the most inside block.


```wl
oo is gglCalendar
sTitle, sAuthorName are strings
WITH oo
	sTitle = ..Title
	WITH ..Author
		sAuthorName = ..Name
	END
END
```

<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>




### Special cases
<a name="special_cases_ELTPARAGRAPHE000076"></a>

- In a class method, you cannot access the members of the class with the &lt;:Member&gt; syntax inside a **WITH** block. The ':' operator is reserved to the element of the **WITH** block. 

- The debugger is used to view the sub-elements of the current **WITH** block.
