The statement block is repeated endlessly. The number of iterations in the statement block is not checked, there is no expression to evaluate.

## Example


```wl
// Exit according to an IF condition
LOOP
	// Read a line in the text file
	ALine = fReadLine(FileNum)
	 IF ALine = EOT THEN BREAK
	ProcessLine(ALine)
END
```


<a name="Example2"></a>



```wl
// Exit according to a WHILE condition
LOOP
	// Read a line in the text file
	ALine = fReadLine(FileNum)
	ProcessLine(ALine)
DO WHILE ALine <> EOT
```




<a name="Example3"></a>





```wl
// Exit according to an iteration
LOOP (10)
	// Read a line in the text file
	ALine = fReadLine(FileNum)
	ProcessLine(ALine)
END
```

## Syntax

### Loop with exit according to an "IF" condition

`LOOP
    ...
    IF <Condition> THEN BREAK
    ...
END
`
---

**`<LOOP>: ()`**

Marks the beginning of the statement block.

**`<BREAK>: ()`**

Used to exit from the statement block.

**`<END>: ()`**

Marks the end of the statement block.  


<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Loop with exit according to a "WHILE" condition

`LOOP
...
DO WHILE <Condition>
`
---

**`<LOOP>: ()`**

Marks the beginning of the statement block.

**`<DO WHILE>: ()`**

Marks the end of the statement block. Used to exit from the statement block. The lines of the loop found before this statement are run.  


<a name="SYNTAX3"></a>

### Loop with exit according to the number of iterations 

`LOOP (<Number of iterations>)
...
END
`
---

**`<LOOP>: ()`**

Marks the beginning of the statement block.

**`<Number of Iterations>: ()`**

Number of iterations to perform. The program will exit the loop when the number of iterations is reached.

**`<END>: ()`**

Marks the end of the statement block.

## Remarks




### Code to run
<a name="code_run_ELTPARAGRAPHE000099"></a>

The code to be executed is placed between the **LOOP** and **END** statements.
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>




### Exiting from a loop
<a name="exiting_from_loop_ELTPARAGRAPHE000107"></a>

Several statements are available:

- [RETURN](../Motscles/1510009.md): Exit the loop and the current process (or procedure).

- [RETURN](../Motscles/1510007.md): Return a status report to the calling process. Exit the loop and the current process (or procedure).

- [BREAK](../Motscles/1510012.md): Exit from the loop and run the rest of the current process.




[Close](../WDLang1/3038018.md) is used to exit from the loop and to close the current window.

**Caution**: [RETURN](../Motscles/1510009.md) and [RETURN](../Motscles/1510007.md) cannot be used **in the same process**.
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>




### Running the next iteration
<a name="running_the_next_iteration_ELTPARAGRAPHE000137"></a>

To directly run the next iteration **without ending the code of the current iteration**, use the [CONTINUE](../Motscles/1510003.md) statement:


```txt
LOOP
	...
	IF <Condition> THEN  CONTINUE		// Go back to the LOOP keyword
	...
END
```

<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>




### Loop without end
<a name="loop_without_end_ELTPARAGRAPHE000150"></a>

During the compilation of the project, an endless loop (no [BREAK](../Motscles/1510012.md), [RETURN](../Motscles/1510009.md) or [RETURN](../Motscles/1510007.md)) is signaled by a warning.
<a name="NOTE0_5"></a>




### External variable in a loop
<a name="external_variable_loop_ELTPARAGRAPHE000167"></a>

A variable declared by [EXTERN](../Motscles/1511013.md) cannot be used in a loop.
