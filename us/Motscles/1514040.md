## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000302"></a>
The following operations are available for the following types of variables: [Date](../Motscles/1514066.md), [Time](../Motscles/1514068.md), [DateTime](../Motscles/1514070.md) and [Duration](../Motscles/1514069.md):

- addition

- subtraction

- comparison




**Remark**: Several WLanguage functions can be used to handle the dates and times (see the functions for managing the dates and times).

## Addition
<a name="addition_ELTTEXTE000326"></a>
The addition operations performed between the Date, Time, DateTime and Duration variables are presented in the table below. This table presents the type of result for each combination:

| Added type<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=fleche2.gif) | Date | Time | DateTime | Duration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Date** | Concatenation of the elements into a string | Concatenation of the elements into a string. This string can be used by [DateTimeDifference](../WDLang1/3027020.md) | Concatenation of the elements into a string | Date variable (Time part ignored) |
| **Time** | Concatenation of the elements into a string | Concatenation of the elements into a string | Concatenation of the elements into a string | Time variable (Date part ignored) |
| **DateTime** | Concatenation of the elements into a string | Concatenation of the elements into a string | Concatenation of the elements into a string | DateTime variable |
| **Duration** | Date variable | Time variable | DateTime variable | Duration variable |


```wl
// Add a DateTime variable and a Time variable
StartDateTime is DateTime = "200112051530"
EndDateTime is DateTime = "200112051730"
ConferenceDuration is Duration = EndDateTime - StartDateTime
 
AdditionalTime is Time = "0330"
FinalDateTime is DateTime
FinalDateTime = ConferenceDuration + AdditionalTime
```



```wl
// Add a DateTime variable and a Duration variable
dtMyDate is DateTime = DateSys() + TimeSys()
dtMyResultDate is DateTime

Trace("Start DateTime: " + dtMyDate)

StartTime is Time = "0117"
EndTime is Time = "2353"  
duMyDuration is Duration = EndTime - StartTime
Trace("Duration in hours: " + NumToString(duMyDuration.InHours) + "h")

dtMyResultDate = dtMaDate + duMyDuration
Trace("DateTime added to a duration: " + dtMyResultDate)
```

## Subtraction
<a name="subtraction_ELTTEXTE000350"></a>
The subtraction operations performed between the Date, Time, DateTime and Duration variables are presented in the table below. This table presents the type of result for each combination:

| Subtracted type<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=fleche2.gif) | Date | Time | DateTime | Duration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Date** | Duration variable | Error | Error | Date variable |
| **Time** | Error | Duration variable | Error | Time variable |
| **DateTime** | Error | Error | Duration variable | DateTime variable |
| **Duration** | Error | Error | Error | Duration variable |


```wl
StartDateTime is DateTime = "200112051530"
EndDateTime is DateTime = "200112071730"
ConferenceDuration is Duration = EndDateTime - StartDateTime
```

## Comparison
<a name="comparison_ELTTEXTE000374"></a>
The comparison operators (=, &lt;&gt;, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=) used between the Date, Time, DateTime and Duration variables are presented in the table below. For each combination this table shows if the comparison is possible.

| Compared type<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=fleche2.gif) | Date | Time | DateTime | Duration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Date** | Possible | Error | Possible (Time part ignored) | Error |
| **Time** | Error | Possible | Possible (Date part ignored) | Error |
| **DateTime** | Possible (Time part ignored) | Possible (Date part ignored) | Possible | Error |
| **Duration** | Error | Error | Error | Possible |


```wl
StartDateTime is DateTime = "200112051530"
EndDateTime is DateTime = "200115051730"
IF EndDateTime > StartDateTime THEN
	Info("The dates are valid")
END
```
