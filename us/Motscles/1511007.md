**MySelf** is used to handle the current control. When the project is run, **MySelf** is replaced with the control (and not by the name of the control). Therefore, **MySelf** is used as a control.

**Benefit**: **MySelf** is used to make a local code (control, item, and so on) or a global code (global procedure, class, and so on) independent of the current control.

## Example


```wl
// - Whenever a Combo Box control is modified
// Call the UpperMask procedure
UpperMask()
```

```wl
// --UpperMask procedure
// Capitalize the 1st letter for an editable Combo Box control
Procedure UpperMask()
Value = MySelf
IF Length(Value) > 1 THEN
	CursorPosition = MySelf.Cursor
	MySelf = Upper(Value[[1]]) + ...
				Lower(Value[[2 TO Length(Value)]])
	MySelf.Cursor = CursorPosition
END

## Remarks


### Handling the current control
<a name="handling_the_current_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000066"></a>

- **MySelf** is always replaced with the current control. For example:

	- Retrieving the value of the current control: 
			
		```wl
		ControlValue = MySelf
		```

			Modifying the value of the current control:
			
		```wl
		MySelf = "Smith"
		```


	- Using a property ([Caption](../Proprietes/2510053.md) for example): 
			
		```wl
		MySelf.Caption = "Name of customers"
		ControlCaption = MySelf.Caption
		```


	- Passing a parameter:
			
		```wl
		CallProcedure(MySelf)
		```





- A WLanguage error occurs if there is no current control.

### Using MySelf in a procedure
<a name="using_myself_procedure_ELTPARAGRAPHE000091"></a>

- **MySelf** can be used in a local procedure or in a global procedure only if the procedure is called in a process associated with a control. In this case, **MySelf** refers to the current control.

- **MySelf** is used to make a procedure "generic": the name of the control is not spelled out. This procedure can be called by several controls.

### WLanguage functions and current control
<a name="wlanguage_functions_and_current_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000099"></a>

To specify the current control in the WLanguage functions that accept a control name as parameter, use:

- an empty string, 

- **Myself** directly.
