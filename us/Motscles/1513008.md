The method for declaring a procedure is the same no matter whether it is: 

- a global procedure,

- a local procedure,

- an [internal procedure](../Motscles/1514075.md).




**Important**: You must not declare two procedures with the same name (especially a global procedure and a local procedure).

**Reminder**: In WLanguage, there is no distinction between the procedures and the functions. The syntaxes for declaring and using procedures also apply to functions.

## Example


```wl
PROCEDURE Find(FileName, Key, Value)
HReadSeek(FileName, Key, Value)
IF HFound() = True THEN
	RETURN True
ELSE
	RESULT False
END
```

## Syntax

### Declaring a procedure with parameters

`PROCEDURE <Procedure name>(<Parameters>) [<Extension attributes>] [: <Type of return>] 
<Procedure code>`
---

**`<PROCEDURE>: ()`**

Start of procedure declaration.

Remark: To make your programs more readable, the **PROCEDURE** keyword can be replaced with the **FUNCTION** keyword.

**`<Procedure name>: ()`**

Name of the procedure to be declared.

**`<Parameters>: ()`**

Parameters passed to the procedure. Each parameter is separated by a comma. For more details on parameters, see [Procedure parameters](../Motscles/1513001.md).
If your procedure or function uses a project element (window, page, report, ...), you have the ability to get the list of requested elements in the completion. To do so, add an extension attribute into the declaration of the function or procedure parameters. 

**`<Extension attributes>: ()`**

Extension attributes used to define the options for managing the code editor. For more details on the available extension attributes, see [the remarks](#NOTE0_4b). 

**`<Type of return>: ()`**

Type of value returned by the procedure. This type can correspond to a simple type (integer, real, string...) or to a structured type (structure, object...).
This information is used to make sure that the procedure always has the same type of value in return. The returned value will always be converted to the specified type. 
For example, if the return type is "Integer" and if the returned value is a string, the string will be automatically converted to integer. 

**`<Procedure code>: ()`**

WLanguage code of procedure to declare.

### Declaring a procedure without parameter

`PROCEDURE <Procedure name>() [<Extension attributes>] [: <Type of return>]
<Procedure code>
`
---

**`<PROCEDURE>: ()`**

Start of procedure declaration.

Remark: To make your programs more readable, the **PROCEDURE** keyword can be replaced with the **FUNCTION** keyword.

**`<Procedure name>: ()`**

Name of the procedure to be declared.

**`<Extension attributes>: ()`**

Extension attributes used to define the options for managing the code editor. For more details on the available extension attributes, see [the remarks](#NOTE0_4b). 

**`<Type of return>: ()`**

Type of value returned by the procedure. This type can correspond to a simple type (integer, real, string...) or to a structured type (structure, object...).
This information is used to make sure that the procedure always has the same type of value in return. The returned value will always be converted to the specified type. 
For example, if the return type is "Integer" and if the returned value is a string, the string will be automatically converted to integer. 

**`<Procedure code>: ()`**

WLanguage code of procedure.

### Declaring a procedure with variable parameters

`PROCEDURE <Procedure name>(<Parameters>, ]*) [<Extension attributes>] [: <Type of return>]
<Procedure code>
`
---

**`<PROCEDURE>: ()`**

Start of procedure declaration.
Remark: To make your programs more readable, the **PROCEDURE** keyword can be replaced with the **FUNCTION** keyword.

**`<Procedure name>: ()`**

Name of the procedure to be declared.

**`<Parameters>: ()`**

Parameters passed to the procedure. Each parameter is separated by a comma.
If the number of parameters that can be passed to the procedure changes, use the "\*" symbol. For example:

- Procedures that can receive between 0 and 255 parameters: Procedure MyProc(\*).

- Procedures that can receive between 1 and 255 parameters: Procedure MyProc(Param1, \*).




For more details, see: 

- [Procedure parameters](../Motscles/1513001.md).

- [Parameters of a procedure with a variable number of parameters](../Motscles/1514080.md)




**`<Extension attributes>: ()`**

Extension attributes used to define the options for managing the code editor. For more details on the available extension attributes, see [the remarks](#NOTE0_4b). 

**`<Type of return>: ()`**

Type of value returned by the procedure. This type can correspond to a simple type (integer, real, string...) or to a structured type (structure, object...).
This information is used to make sure that the procedure always has the same type of value in return. The returned value will always be converted to the specified type. 
For example, if the return type is "Integer" and if the returned value is a string, the string will be automatically converted to integer.

## Remarks




### Creating a procedure
<a name="creating_procedure_ELTPARAGRAPHE000171"></a>

For more details on how to create a global procedure, see [Global procedures](../Motscles/1513005.md).

For more details on how to create a local procedure, see [Local procedures](../Motscles/1513009.md).
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>




### Exiting from a procedure
<a name="exiting_from_procedure_ELTPARAGRAPHE000187"></a>

To force the exit from a procedure, use the [RETURN](../Motscles/1510009.md) keyword. In the procedure, none of the processes after the [RETURN](../Motscles/1510009.md) keyword are executed.

For example:


```wl
PROCEDURE Calculate(Dividend)
IF Dividend = 0 THEN
	Error("Unable to divide by zero")
	RETURN
ELSE
	...
END
```


Remarks:

- If the procedure returns a result, use the [RETURN](../Motscles/1510007.md) keyword.

- The [RETURN](../Motscles/1510009.md) and [RETURN](../Motscles/1510007.md) keywords cannot be used in the same process.

### "At the end of the event containing the call"
<a name="the_end_the_event_containing_the_call_ELTPARAGRAPHE000218"></a>

The procedures with the option "At the end of the event containing the call" enabled, and called from a callback procedure (procedure used by [fListFile](../WDLang1/3036058.md), [Event](../WDLang1/3015011.md), etc.) are executed at the end of each call to the callback.

Example:


```txt
// -----------------
// standard case
// -----------------
Click of button
// beginning of button click code
Proc1
// beginning of Procedure1 code 
Proc2
// beginning of Procedure2 code 

Call to EndEvent procedure
// end of Proc2 code
// end of Proc1 code
// end of button click code 
Execution of EndEvent procedure
```



```txt
// -------------------
// callback case
// -------------------
Click of button
Proc1
Proc2
use of fListFile
Callback1 procedure
// beginning of code of Callback1 Procedure
CallbackProc2
// beginning of code of Callback2 Procedure
Call to ProcEndEvent
// end of ProcedureCallback2 code
// end of ProcedureCallback1 code
Execution of ProcEndEvent
ProcedureCallback1
// beginning of ProcedureCallback1 code
ProcedureCallback2
// beginning of ProcedureCallback2 code
Call to ProcEndEvent
// end of ProcedureCallback2 code
// end of ProcedureCallback1 code
Execution of ProcEndEvent
```





<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>




### Returning a result
<a name="returning_result_ELTPARAGRAPHE000239"></a>

To return the procedure result to the calling process, use [RETURN](../Motscles/1510007.md). This keyword is used to return: 

- a value, 

- several values.




For example:


```wl
// Procedure that returns a value
PROCEDURE Find(FileName, Key, Value)
HReadSeek(FileName, Key, Value)
IF HFound() = True THEN
	RETURN True
ELSE
	RESULT False
END
```



```wl
// Procedure that returns several values
PROCEDURE MyProc()

// Process
RETURN (1, 2, 3)


// Code for calling the procedure
( x, y, z ) = MyProc()
// x is set to 1, y to 2 and z to 3
```


**Tip**: For the procedures that return a result, we recommend that you use the **FUNCTION** keyword instead of **PROCEDURE** to simplify the code reading.

Important: The [RETURN](../Motscles/1510009.md) keyword must not be used to force the exit from a procedure that returns a result. The procedure call expects a status report that will not be returned if the exit from the procedure is forced.
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Stamping the return value
<a name="stamping_the_return_value_ELTPARAGRAPHE000271"></a>

To specify the type of return value, all you have to do is specify this type (preceded by ':') when declaring the procedure. For example:


```wl
PROCEDURE Calculation(): Int

IF MyExpression = True then
	RESULT "1"  // The string "1" will be converted to integer
ELSE
	RESULT 0
END
```


**Remark**: Multiple return values
You have the ability to assign a type to the return values. The syntax is as follows: 


```txt
PROCEDURE ProcedureName(): ([<Type value 1>, [<Type value 2>, ... , [<Type value N>]]])
```


Remark: There is no need to specify the type for all return values. To avoid specifying the type of a return value, all you have to do is omit the type or use the '?' character. 
Example: 
```wl
PROCEDURE Procedure_Name(): (string..string)

RESULT(1,2,3)
```


```wl
PROCEDURE Procedure_Name(): (string,?,string)

RESULT(1,2,3)
```


The following types of return values are allowed:

| --- | --- | --- |
| boolean |   | Automatic WLanguage conversions |
| unsigned int |   | Automatic WLanguage conversions |
