A structure can be allocated dynamically: we talk of dynamic instantiation of the structure.

The dynamic instantiation of structure is used to create a structure at a given time and to free this structure when it is no longer used.

**To instantiate a structure**, you must:

1. Declare a dynamic structure.

2. Instantiate a structure.




**Remark**: The structure is automatically freed when it is not used anymore. However, you can force the destruction of the structure.

<a name="sample_code"></a>

## Example


```wl
MyExampleFile is structure 
	Name is String
	Extension is String
	Directory is String
END
SourceFile is dynamic MyExampleFile
// ...
SourceFile = New MyExampleFile
// Process on the object ...
// ...
// Free the object
Delete SourceFile
```
<a name="Example2"></a>

```wl
// Declaration of the structure in the declaration code of a class
MyClass is Class
	sMB is string
END

MyExampleFile is Structure 
	Name		is string
	Extension	is string
	Directory	is string
END

//---------------------------------------------------------------------
// Declaration of a dynamic array with this structure: 
ArraySourceFile is array * dynamic MyClass.MyExampleFile
```

## Syntax

### Declare a dynamic structure

`<Variable name> is dynamic <Structure name>
`
---

**`<Variable name>: ()`**

Name identifying the variable of the structure.

**`<Structure name>: ()`**

Name identifying the structure. This name was defined when creating the structure  


<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Instantiating a dynamic structure

`<Variable name> = New <Structure name>
`
---

**`<Variable name>: ()`**

Name identifying the variable of the structure.

**`<Structure name>: ()`**

Name of a structure that was declared beforehand.  


<a name="SYNTAX3"></a>

### Freeing a dynamic structure

`Delete <Structure name>
`
---

**`<Structure name>: ()`**

Name of the structure variable to use.
