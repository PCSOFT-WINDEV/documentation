**MyParent** is used to handle:

- The current supercontrol from an element of the supercontrol. 
	When running the window, **MyParent** is replaced with the supercontrol (and not by the name of the supercontrol). Then, **MyParent** is used like a supercontrol.
	Advantage: **MyParent** is used to make the code of the controls found in the supercontrol (control, button, ...) or the code of the functions associated with the supercontrol independent of the supercontrol name.

- The current report from one of the report controls.

- The current window from one of the window controls.

FileName = fSelect(fExtractPath(FileName, fDirectory), ...
	fExtractPath(FileName, fFile + fExtension), ...

// The value of the supercontrol corresponds to the selected file
MyParent..Value = FileName

## Remarks




### Handling the current supercontrol
<a name="handling_the_current_supercontrol_ELTPARAGRAPHE000073"></a>

- **MyParent** is always replaced with the current supercontrol. For example, passing a parameter:
	
	```wl
	CallProcedure(MyParent)
	```


- **MyParent** can only be used in the processes that handle the current supercontrol (for example, in the processes associated with a control found in the supercontrol, in the procedures associated with the supercontrol, ...).
