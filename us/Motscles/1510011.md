The conditional **IF** statement allows you to run an action according to a condition.

<a name="sample_code"></a>

## Example


```wl
IF Customer.CalculatedAge > 60 THEN
	Elderly += 1
ELSE IF Customer.CalculatedAge > 18 THEN
	Adult += 1
ELSE IF Customer.CalculatedAge > 4 THEN
	Child += 1
ELSE 
	Baby += 1
END
```


<a name="Example2"></a>

```wl
// Use of 'IN'
IF Customer.City IN ("PARIS", "MARSEILLE", "LYON") THEN
	Info("You live in one of the 3 biggest cities in France")
END

// Use of 'NOT x IN'
IF NOT Customer.City IN ("PARIS", "MARSEILLE", "LYON") THEN
	Info("You don't live in one of the 3 biggest cities in France")
END

// Use of 'NOT IN' (from version 23)
IF Customer.City NOT IN ("PARIS", "MARSEILLE", "LYON") THEN
	Info("You don't live in one of the 3 biggest cities in France")
END
```

[...]]]
END
`
---

## Remarks




### Single-line conditional statement 
<a name="singleline_conditional_statement_ELTPARAGRAPHE000114"></a>

You also have the ability to use the following syntax:


```txt
<Result> = <Condition>? <Expression 1> ELSE <Expression 2>
```


Detailed syntax:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| &lt;Result&gt; | Variable to assign with the condition result. |
| &lt;Condition&gt; | Condition to check. |
| &lt;Expression 1&gt; | Value assigned to &lt;Result&gt; if the condition is True. |
| &lt;Expression 2&gt; | Value assigned to &lt;Result&gt; if the condition is False. |

Equivalence:


```txt
IF <Condition> THEN
	<Result> = <Expression 1>
ELSE
	<Result> = <Expression 2>
END
```


**Remark**: The single-line conditional expression can be directly used in an expression.

**Example**: Increment the number of persons when the age is greater than 60, otherwise the number of persons remains the same.  


```wl
Elderly = Customer.CalculatedAge > 60? Elderly +1 ELSE Elderly
```

### Condition
<a name="condition_ELTPARAGRAPHE000153"></a>

&lt;Condition&gt; can take the following format:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| <br><br>- &lt;Value&gt;** =** &lt;Expression&gt;<br><br><br> | Equality test |
| <br><br>- &lt;Value&gt; **&lt;** &lt;Expression&gt;<br><br><br> | Comparison test |
| <br><br>- &lt;Value&gt; **&lt;=** &lt;Expression&gt;<br><br><br> | Comparison test |
| <br><br>- &lt;Value&gt;** &gt;** &lt;Expression&gt;<br><br><br> | Comparison test |
| <br><br>- &lt;Value&gt; **&gt;=** &lt;Expression&gt;<br><br><br> | Comparison test |
| <br><br>- &lt;Value&gt; **=** &lt;Minimum Expression&gt;** TO** &lt;Maximum Expression&gt;<br><br><br> | &lt;Value&gt; must be included between the minimum expression and the maximum expression |
| <br><br>- &lt;Minimum Expression&gt; **&lt;=** &lt;Value&gt; **&lt;=** &lt;Maximum Expression&gt;<br><br><br> |   |
| <br><br>- &lt;Value&gt; **IN** (&lt;Expression1&gt;, &lt;Expression2&gt;, ..., &lt;Expression N&gt;)<br><br><br> | &lt;Value&gt; is compared to the result of a list of expressions. All the expressions found in the list are evaluated. The operator returns <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if &lt;Value&gt; is equal to at least one of the expressions, <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if &lt;Value&gt; is equal to none of the expressions. |
| <br><br>- &lt;Value&gt; **NOT IN** (&lt;Expression1&gt;, &lt;Expression2&gt;, ..., &lt;Expression N&gt;)<br><br><br> | &lt;Value&gt; is compared to the result of a list of expressions. All the expressions found in the list are evaluated. The operator returns <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if &lt;Value&gt; is equal to at least one of the expressions, <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if &lt;Value&gt; is equal to none of the expressions. |
| <br><br>- &lt;Value&gt; **_IN_** (&lt;Expression1&gt;, &lt;Expression2&gt;, ..., &lt;Expression N&gt;)<br><br><br> | &lt;Value&gt; is compared to the result of a list of expressions. The expressions are evaluated from left to right. As soon as an expression is equal to &lt;Value&gt;, the remaining expressions are not evaluated and the operator returns <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>. If &lt;Value&gt; is equal to no expression, the operator returns <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>. |
| <br><br>- &lt;Value&gt; **NOT _IN_** (&lt;Expression1&gt;, &lt;Expression2&gt;, ..., &lt;Expression N&gt;)<br><br><br> | &lt;Value&gt; is compared to the result of a list of expressions. The expressions are evaluated from left to right. As soon as an expression is equal to &lt;Value&gt;, the remaining expressions are not evaluated and the operator returns <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>. If &lt;Value&gt; is equal to no expression, the operator returns <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>.<br><br>Caution: there must be a space between "NOT" and "_IN_". |

### Composite condition
<a name="composite_condition_ELTPARAGRAPHE000242"></a>

The **AND** and **OR** keywords are used to perform logical operations and to create composite conditions.

For example:


```wl
IF Customer.City = "Montpellier" AND Customer.Title = "Mr" THEN
	ManMontpellier ++   // Number of men living in Montpellier
END
 
IF Customer.City = "Montpellier" OR Customer.City = "Lyon" THEN
	MontpellierLyon ++ // Number of customers living in Montpellier or in Lyon
END
```


The conditions made of **AND** and **OR** are entirely evaluated.

For example: 
A &gt; 10 AND B &lt; 20

Even if the first condition (A &gt; 10) is false, the second condition (B &lt; 20) will be checked.

**Optimizing the evaluation of composite conditions:** Use the _AND_ and _OR_ keywords. If the first condition is false (A&gt;10 in our example), the second condition (B&lt;20 in our example) will not be checked. For more details, see [Logical operators](../Motscles/1512003.md).
