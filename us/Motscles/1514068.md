The **Time** type allows you to easily handle the times. This type is used to manage the conversions almost automatically ([TimeToString](../WDLang1/3027023.md), [TimeToInteger](../WDLang1/3027017.md), ...)

This type can be used:

- to retrieve and handle the HFSQL items in Time format. 

- to retrieve and handle the edit controls in Time format.

- in the WLanguage functions used to manage the times.

- to perform calculations on the times (difference, addition, ...). For more details, see [Operations that can be performed on the Time type](../Motscles/1514040.md).




**Remarks**:

- Several properties can be used with the **Time** type, to retrieve part of the time for example (hour, minute, ...).

- For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

## Example


```wl
StartTime is Time = 1205
EndTime is Time = "2030"     // 20:30
CurrentTime is Time = TimeSys()
```

## Syntax

### Declaring and initializing a variable

`<Variable name> is Time = <Value>

OR

 <Variable name> is Time
<Variable name> = <Value>`
---

**`<Variable name>: ()`**

Name of the variable to declare.

**`<Value>: ()`**

Value that will be assigned to the variable. The type of this value can be:

- **Time**

- **DateTime**: only the time will be taken into account. 

- **character string**, in the following format:

	- HHMM

	- HHMMSS

	- HHMMSSCC

	- HHMMSSCCC
			Only the hours and the minutes will be taken into account. 
			(HH: Hour, MM: minutes, SS: seconds, CC: hundredths of a second, CCC: thousandths of a second)




- **integer**: the time will correspond to the number of hundredths of a second passed since midnight "00:00:00:00". Midnight corresponds to the integer 0. It cannot exceed 8, 639, 999 (24 hours - 1 hundredth of a second).

### Declaration and initialization
<a name="declaration_and_initialization_ELTPARAGRAPHE000113"></a>

- A Time variable can be initialized with a value of the following type:

	- **Time**

	- **DateTime**: only the time will be taken into account.

	- **character string**, in the following format:
			- HHMM
			- HHMMSS
			- HHMMSSCC
			- HHMMSSCCC
			Only the hours and the minutes will be taken into account (HH: Hour, MM: minutes, SS: seconds, CC: hundredths of a second, CCC: thousandths of a second).

	- **integer**: the time will correspond to the number of hundredths of a second passed since midnight "00:00:00:00". Midnight corresponds to the integer 0. It cannot exceed 8, 639, 999 (24 hours - 1 hundredth of a second).




- By default, a Time variable is initialized with the system time. To define the default value assigned to the [Date](../Motscles/1514066.md), **Time** and [DateTime](../Motscles/1514070.md) variables, use [DateTimeByDefault](../WDLang1/3027015.md).




Remark: You also have the ability to initialize a **Time** variable with the system time by using [Now](../WDLang1/3027024.md).

### Assigning a Time variable to a Time item
<a name="assigning_time_variable_time_item_ELTPARAGRAPHE000153"></a>

From now on, when a Time variable is assigned to a Time item, the seconds and the hundreds of a second are taken into account according to the format of the item.

For example, if the Time variable corresponds to "HHMMSSCCC":


|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Item of the data file | Up to version 100050 of WINDEV, WEBDEV, WINDEV Mobile | From version 100050 of WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile |
| String item | HHMM | **HHMMSSCCC** |
| Time item in HHMM format | HHMM | HHMM |
| Time item in HHMMSS format | HHMM | **HHMMSS** |
| Time item in HHMMSSMM format | HHMM | **HHMMSSMM** |


<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>




### Properties that can be used on the times
<a name="properties_that_can_used_the_times_ELTPARAGRAPHE000194"></a>

The following properties can be used on the times: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [Time](../Proprietes/2512038.md) | Returns or modifies the hour (in integer format). |
| [Millisecond](../Proprietes/2512062.md) | Returns or modifies the number of milliseconds (in integer format). |
| [Minute](../Proprietes/2512050.md) | Returns or modifies the number of minutes (in integer format). |
| [Second](../Proprietes/2512081.md) | Returns or modifies the number of seconds (in integer format). |


For more details, see [Operations that can be performed on the Time type](../Motscles/1514040.md).


```wl
StartTime is Time = "20011201"
// Adds 5 hours
StartTime.Hour += 5
// Modifies the number of minutes
StartTime.Minute = 5
```

<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>




### Limits
<a name="limits_ELTPARAGRAPHE000231"></a>

The **Time** type is used to manage the hours found between 00:00 and 23:59. The precision is up to the millisecond.
