The Variant type is used to:

- store any **simple** value: boolean, numeric (Currency, Real, Integer, etc.), characters and character string, date (Date, Time, DateTime and Duration), etc.

- store named or indexed sub-elements.

- store any **complex** value: structures, classes, advanced types, arrays, associative arrays, queues, stacks and lists.

- handle the NULL value in WLanguage.

- store interactions with ActiveX objects and Automation programming.

## Syntax

### Declaring and assigning a Variant type

`<Variable name> is Variant = <Value>
 
OR 

 
  <Variable name> is Variant
  <Variable name> = <Value>
`
---

**`<Variable name>: ()`**

Name of the variable to declare.

**`<Value>: ()`**

Value that will be assigned to the variable. One of the following values can be assigned to a Variant variable:

- any literal value,

- the content of a variable,

- the content of a simple control,

- the content of an item.

## Remarks




### Variant type and NULL
<a name="variant_type_and_null_ELTPARAGRAPHE000088"></a>

To specify that a Variant variable contains no value, use the NULL constant.

Remarks: 

- for a Variant type, NULL means "Not assigned".

- for a Numeric type, NULL means "equal to 0".





```wl
nVal is int
IF vVal = Null THEN ... // the test returns True because nVal=0
nVal = 5
IF vVal = Null THEN ... // the test returns False because nVal=5
```



```wl
vVal is Variant
IF vVal = Null THEN ... // returns True because the variant is not assigned
vVal = 0
IF vVal = Null THEN ... // returns False because the variant is assigned   
	// with an integer whose value is 0
vVal = 5
IF vVal = Null THEN ... // returns False because the variant is assigned
	// with an integer whose value is 5
```



```wl
vVal is Variant
vVal = Null
IF vVal = 0 THEN ... // returns True because a non-assigned variable 
// and a value cannot be compared, True is returned by convention
```

### Type of a variant
<a name="type_variant_ELTPARAGRAPHE000107"></a>

The type of a variant is returned by the [Type](../Proprietes/2510131.md) property. The [Type](../Proprietes/2510131.md) property is used to get the type of value stored in the variable.

Remarks: 

- [VariantConvert](../WDLang1/3013054.md) is used to convert the type of value stored in a Variant variable.

- [TypeVar](../WDLang1/3013056.md) is used to determine the type of variable (Variant type for a Variant variable). 





```wl
vVal is Variant
TypeVar(vVal)  // returns the number of the variant type
vVal..Type     // returns the type of the value stored in the variant
```

<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>




### Class property on variants
<a name="class_property_variants_ELTPARAGRAPHE000132"></a>

[Class](../Proprietes/2514004.md) is used to obtain the name of the class used if the variant corresponds to a class.
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Named sub-elements
<a name="named_subelements_ELTPARAGRAPHE000143"></a>

You can directly use members without any declaration on a Variant variable.

**When assigning a member**, if the member does not exist, it is automatically created ; if the member already exits, it is modified.

Example: 


```wl
Person is Variant
Person.LastName = "MOORE"
Person.FirstName = "Vince"
```


**When reading a member**, if the member does not exist, it is not created. You can check if a member exists using the **Exist** property.
Example: 

```wl
Person is Variant
IF NOT Personn.Name..Exist THEN
	Error("The name was not specified")
END
```


If the member does not exist, the returned value is Null. Multiple methods can be used to test the Null value: 

- use the **Value** property. 
	Example: 
	
	```wl
	Element is variant
	IF Element.MemberNotFound..Value = Null THEN
		...
	END
	```


- test the Null value directly. Example: 
	
	```wl
	Element is variant
	IF Element.MemberNotFound = Null THEN
		...
	END
	```





The named sub-elements can be handled by the following properties: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| **Exist** | Returns: <br><br>- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the element exists,<br><br>- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if the element does not exist. The element is not created. <br><br><br> |
| **Name** | Element name |
| **Type** | Type of element (same values as [TypeVar](../WDLang1/3013056.md)). |
| **Value** | Element value. |


Using the [Member](../Proprietes/1000021078.md) property on Variant variables allows you to get the array of named elements. This array can be handled by FOR EACH, the [Count](../Proprietes/2510097.md) property, the [ ] operator, ... 
It is also possible to delete an element. Example: 

```wl
o is JSON
o.m = 1
o.n = 2
Trace(o)

x is Variant = o
Delete(x..Member, 1)
Trace(x) // The member has been deleted.
```

### Indexed sub-elements
<a name="indexed_subelements_ELTPARAGRAPHE000229"></a>

The Variant variable can be directly used as an array of variants. Using the [ ] operator automatically creates the array.

Example: 


```wl
Days is Variant
Days[1] = "Monday"
Days[2] = "Tuesday"
Days[3] = "Wednesday"
Days[4] = "Thursday"
Days[5] = "Friday"
Days[6] = "Saturday"
Days[7] = "Sunday"
```


The array operations can be directly performed on the Variant variable: FOR EACH, [Count](../Proprietes/2510097.md), [ ] operator, etc.
<a name="NOTE0_6"></a>


### Nesting named and indexed sub-elements
<a name="nesting_named_and_indexed_subelements_ELTPARAGRAPHE000253"></a>

Since the named and indexed sub-elements are of type Variant, they can be nested recursively.

Example: 


```wl
Library is Variant
Library.Book[1].Title = "Mrs Dalloway"
Library.Book[1].Author = "Virginia Woolf"
Library.Book[2].Title = "Oliver Twist"
Library.Book[2].Author = "Charles Dickens"
```
