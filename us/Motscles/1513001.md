A procedure can receive parameters. Let's see the different possibilities regarding the management of parameters in WLanguage:

- [Passing parameters: by reference and value](../Motscles/1514077.md).
	By default, when calling a procedure, the parameters are ***passed by variable (by address or by reference)***. You also have the ability to pass the parameters by value in WLanguage. 

- [Data type of parameters](../Motscles/1514076.md).
	The description of the parameter type is optional. However, you can specify the data types of parameters. 

- [Optional parameters](../Motscles/1514078.md).
	Some of the parameters passed to a procedure can be optional parameters. 

- [Variable parameters](../Motscles/1514080.md).
	You have the ability to handle the parameters passed to a procedure using a variable number of parameters. 

- [Useful parameters](../Motscles/1514081.md).
	You have the ability to manage the parameters declared but not used.




**Reminder**:

- In WLanguage, there is no distinction between the procedures and the functions. The procedures and the functions are managed in the same way.

- You have the ability to create overloaded procedures. For more details, see [Prototype overload](../Motscles/1514063.md).

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) You have the ability to use named parameters. For more details, see [Calling a procedure: Named parameters](../Motscles/1513007.md). 

- A parameter can correspond to any type of variable. A class instance can be passed as parameter to a procedure.
