<a name="NOTE1_1"></a>
Extension attributes are special WLanguage statements that allow you to add specific properties or functionalities to variables or procedures. These extension attributes help simplify code and facilitate the maintenance of your applications.

WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile support several extension attributes. This page presents the different extension attributes available, grouped by theme.

The extension attribute categories are: 

- [General extension attributes](#NOTE2_1),

- [Extension attributes specific to OOP and MVP](#NOTE3_1),

- [Extension attributes specific to variables](#NOTE4_1),

- [Extension attributes specific to local, global or internal procedures](#NOTE5_1).

- [Extension attributes to manage timers](#NOTE6_1). 

- [Extension attributes to manage threads](#NOTE7_1).




To simplify the input of extension attributes, the code editor automatically proposes the list of available extension attributes when the "&lt;" key is pressed. For more details, see [Automatic completion](../Editeurs/2013001.md).

## General extension attributes
<a name="general_extension_attributes_ELTTEXTE000724"></a>
The general extension attributes are: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| **C#** | Used to define a WLanguage procedure that can be called via a C# code. <br><br>For more details, see [C#: Call to WLanguage procedure](../Editeurs/2012009.md). <br><br>![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png)![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Not available |
| **GUI** / **UI** | Used to specify the use of the variable or procedure in a code or process containing both UI code and Business logic. <br><br>For more details, see [Splitting Business logic/UI code](../Editeurs/9000188.md). |
| **Java** | Used to define a WLanguage procedure that can be called via a Java code. <br><br>For more details, see [Android and Java: call WLanguage procedures](../Editeurs/9000199.md). <br><br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Available only on Java, Android and Android widget. |
| **Business logic** | Used to specify the use of the variable or procedure in a code or process containing both UI code and Business logic. <br><br>For more details, see [Splitting Business logic/UI code](../Editeurs/9000188.md). |
| **ObjC** | Used to define a WLanguage procedure that can be called via an Objective C code. <br><br>For more details, see [Objective C: Calling a WLanguage procedure](../Editeurs/1000019915.md). <br><br> |
| **browser synchronized** | Used to make a global server variable available on the browser side. The content is synchronized. <br><br>The value assigned to a "browser synchronized" global variable in server code is retrieved in a browser code executed later. <br>The value assigned to a global variable in a browser code is retrieved the next time a server code is executed.<br><br>**Limit**: To avoid overwriting, changes are synchronized only: <br><br>- if the server process is executed with the ["Send value of controls to server (THML: submit)"](../WDChamp/1013074.md) option<br><br>- if the *ajaxSynchronizeServerVariables* constant is used with [AJAXExecute](../WDLang2/3055114.md) /[AJAXExecuteAsynchronous](../WDLang2/3055115.md).<br><br><br>Caution: Changes are not synchronized for the server code of an Upload control or Clickable Image control because these processes do not send the value of the controls to the server.<br><br>To use this extension attribute it is necessary to use the [framework V2](../Editeurs/9000186.md) of the browser code. |
| **xmlAttribute** | Used to specify that the member is created as attribute (instead of tag). <br><br>For more details, see [Serialize](../WDLang1/3013065.md).<br><br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Not available |

| **copy** | Used to specify the operation to be performed when copying an instance of an object. <br><br>- &lt;Copy=Clone&gt;: when used on a dynamic object, this extension attribute allows forcing the cloning of the object. <br><br>- &lt;Copy=False&gt;: when used on a member, this extension attribute prevents copying the member's value when copying an object to another object. <br><br><br><br><br>For more details, see [Copying and cloning](../POO/6010018.md). |
| **force destructor** | Forces the call to the destructor (deletes the object), even if an element holds a strong reference to this object.<br><br>For more details, see [Advanced management of class instances](../POO/6010012.md). |
| **weak** | Indicates a weak reference. In this case, objects will be automatically deleted according to their scope (even if a global reference was taken on these objects). The low reference must be specified during the dynamic instantiation of the object taking reference.<br><br>For more details, see [Advanced management of class instances](../POO/6010012.md). |
| **note** | Allows you to insert a comment about a class member (&lt;note=Comment about the member&gt;). The content of this note can is returned by the **AttributeNote** property of a [Variable Description](../WDLang1/1000019560.md). <br>Reminder: The **Variable Description** type is used to get information about a class or structure member. <br><br>For more details, see [Variable Description](../WDLang1/1000019560.md). |

| **browser synchronized** | Used to synchronize a variable global to the project to make it available on the browser side. In this case the value assigned to a global variable in a browser code, can be retrieved later in a server code. <br><br>For more details, see [Global and local variables](../Motscles/1514054.md). |
| **server only** | Used to protect a variable global to the project to make it unavailable on the browser side. <br><br>For more details, see [Global and local variables](../Motscles/1514054.md). |

## Remark
<a name="remark_ELTTEXTE000868"></a>
You can combine several extension attributes using the syntax, according to the type of declaration and the object used: 
```txt
Declaration of my object <Name Attribute 1=value1, Name Attribute 2=value2, ...>
```

For example, for a declaration of a buffer variable: 
```txt
Class
	m_buffer is Buffer <serialize=false,mapping="ImageMemo">
END
```
