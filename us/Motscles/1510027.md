Runs a process only after a given procedure has been executed, and continues to execute the current code while waiting for this procedure to end. This type of instruction is used to: 

- call a SOAP Webservice asynchronously. 

- call a browser procedure (with a return value) from a WEBDEV Page control. 

- call a window procedure (with a return value) from a page contained in a WEBDEV Page control.

## Example


```wl
trackingSearch is trackSearch
trackingSearchRes is resultTrackSearch
trackingSearch.accountNumber = 99999999
trackingSearch.consigneesCountry = "FR"
trackingSearch.consigneesZipCode = "37100"
trackingSearch.sendersRef = "111111"

AFTER trackingSearchRes = TrackingServiceWSService.trackSearch(trackingSearch) DO
	IF ErrorOccurred() THEN
		Trace("Failed to call the Webservice: " + ErrorInfo(errFullDetails))
	ELSE
		Trace("Webservice successfully run")
	END
END

### Asynchronous call to a SOAP Webservice

`AFTER <Result> = <SOAP Webservice call> DO
       <Code executed if response>
END
<Code executed after SOAP Webservice call>
`
---

**`<AFTER>: ()`**

Marks the beginning of the statement block.

**`<Result>: ()`**

Result of the execution of the SOAP Webservice. 

**`<SOAP Webservice call>: ()`**

Call to the procedure used to query the SOAP Webservice.  

**`<Code executed if response>: ()`**

Code executed only if the SOAP Webservice has been executed and has sent the response. 

**`<Code executed after SOAP Webservice call>: ()`**

Code executed directly after the call to the SOAP webservice (whether or not the SOAP webservice sent a response). 

**`<END>: ()`**

Marks the end of the statement block.

## Remarks


### Webservice: How to retrieve the Webservice response? 
<a name="webservice_how_retrieve_the_webservice_response_ELTPARAGRAPHE000087"></a>

The Webservice response can be retrieved in &lt;Code executed if response&gt;. Several syntaxes are available: 

- Declaration of the return value in the block AFTER ... DO: 
	In this case, the Webservice returns a wsResponse variable. To be manipulated, this variable must be explicitly assigned to the variable used to retrieve the result of the Webservice. 
	```txt
	AFTER x = Websevice_Call() DO
		// here x is a wsResponse, it must be explicitly assigned 
		// in a variable used to retrieve the result of the Webservice
		Res is TypeWS = x
		// code executed after the Webservice response
		// .... = Res
	END
	// code executed immediately
	```


- Declaration of the return value outside the block AFTER ... DO: 
	In this case, the return variable can be manipulated directly. 
	
	```txt
	Res is TypeWS
	AFTER Res  = WebseviceNoResponse() DO
		// code executed after the Webservice response
		// .... = Res
	END
	// code executed immediately
	```






### Syntax for SOAP Webservices
<a name="syntax_for_soap_webservices_ELTPARAGRAPHE000102"></a>

- This syntax can only be used for calling SOAP Webservices. 

- The &lt;Code executed if response&gt; is executed as a Callback procedure once the Webservice has been executed and has sent a response. 

- Important: the code executed after the SOAP Webservice call (after the END keyword) is executed in the context of the calling thread. If the call is made in the main thread, the execution of a wait function ([ThreadPause](../WDLang1/3077029.md), [Multitask](../WDLang1/3015004.md), [EventWait](../WDLang1/3077007.md), etc.) will cause a deadlock.

- The [ErrorOccurred](../WDLang1/3087001.md) WLanguage variable can be used to handle possible errors during the call to the SOAP Webservice. For example: 
	
	```wl
	// Calls the SOAP Webservice to verify the VAT number
	AFTER MyResponse = checkVat(sCountry, sVATNum) DO
		// If an error occurred
		IF ErrorOccurred THEN
			...
		END
	END
	```
