## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000174"></a>
The [global procedures](../Motscles/1513005.md) are grouped in sets of procedures.

A set of procedures is used to:

- Share the global procedures between several projects.

- Divide global procedures between several developers, for the same project. In this case, the management of global procedures is simplified. You can for example: 

	- lock this set only when modifications are made to a global procedure.

	- modify one or more global procedures even if the project is currently modified by another user.







The sets of procedures found in a WINDEV project or in a WINDEV Mobile project can be shared with a WEBDEV project.
**Caution**: Only the code compatible with WEBDEV must be used in the shared set of procedures.

### WINDEV or WINDEV Mobile project
<a name="windev_windev_mobile_project_ELTPARAGRAPHE000035"></a>

In a WINDEV or WINDEV Mobile project, the global procedures are grouped in at least one set of procedures. Each set of procedures is a ".WDG" file.
<a name="NOTE2_2"></a>
<a name="NOTE2_3"></a>


### Events of the sets of procedures
<a name="events_the_sets_procedures_ELTPARAGRAPHE000058"></a>

The sets of procedures have a "Declarations" event and an "Ending" event.

Like any window or project, the sets of procedures can own:

- Their own global variables.

- Their own constants.

- Their own declaration event of global variables.

- Their own ending event.




To access a global variable in a set of procedures from the project, the name of the variable must be prefixed with the name of the set of procedures. For example: 

```txt
MySet.MyVariable
```

<a name="NOTE3_1"></a>


## Handling the sets of procedures

### Creating a set of procedures
<a name="creating_set_procedures_ELTPARAGRAPHE000085"></a>

A set of procedures can be created from the "Project explorer" pane.

To create a set of procedures from the project explorer: 

1. Select "Procedures" in the project explorer.

2. Select "New set of procedures" in the context menu.
	

3. Specify the name of the set of procedures and validate.



<a name="NOTE3_2"></a>


### Importing a set of procedures
<a name="importing_set_procedures_ELTPARAGRAPHE000102"></a>

A set of procedures can be imported into a project. The procedures found in this imported set can then be used in your project.

A set of procedures can be imported from the "Project explorer" pane.

To import a set of procedures from the project explorer: 

1. Select "Procedures" in the project explorer.

2. Select "Import a set of procedures" in the context menu.
	

3. Specify the name and path of the set of procedures to import and validate.

### Overriding procedures
<a name="overriding_procedures_ELTPARAGRAPHE000121"></a>

Two procedures with the same name can be defined in different sets of procedures used by the same project.

To access one of these procedures, the name of the procedure must be prefixed by the name of the set of procedures to use.

For example, to use the **Display** procedure found in the set of procedures named **Screen**, you must write: Screen.Display().
