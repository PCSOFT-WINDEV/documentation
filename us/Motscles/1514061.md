A composite variable contains different types of elements (members).

**Remark**: If you are handling custom variables, we advise you to declare:

- a ***composite variable*** if a single variable of this type is used in your project (to pass parameters to an API for example).

- a ***structure*** type if several variables of this type are used in different processes of the project.

## Example


```wl
ProductRef is composed of
	SCode is int
	PdtCode is fixed string on 10
END
ProductRef.SCode = 7
ProductRef.PdtCode = "Screen"
```

## Syntax

### Declaring a composite variable

`<Variable name> is composed of
    <Members of the composite variable>
END
`
---

**`<Variable name>: ()`**

Name of the composite variable to declare.

**`<Structure members>: ()`**

Declarations of the variables found in the composite variable. These variables are called ***members*** of the composite variable.

**`<END>: ()`**

End of declaration of the composite variable.

## Remarks




### Handling a composite variable
<a name="handling_composite_variable_ELTPARAGRAPHE000081"></a>

There is no need to reference the members of composite variable.

For example:


```wl
CompositeVar is composed of
	Member1 is fixed string on 8
	Member2 is fixed string on 12
END
Str = CompositeVar // Str is built by concatenating all the members
				// of the composite variable
CompositeVar = Str // Str is transferred to the composite variable
```

### Type of the members in a composite variable
<a name="type_the_members_composite_variable_ELTPARAGRAPHE000093"></a>

The members of a composite variable can have the following types:

- [Integer](../Motscles/1514049.md) (or selected among the [advanced integers](../Motscles/1514049.md)).

- [Real](../Motscles/1514048.md) (or selected among the [advanced reals](../Motscles/1514048.md)).

- [Currency](../Motscles/1514043.md).

- [String](../Motscles/1514044.md) (or selected among the [advanced strings](../Motscles/1514044.md)).

- Array (["simple" array](../Motscles/1514030.md), [dynamic array](../Motscles/1514057.md) or [fixed array](../Motscles/1514025.md)).

- [Automation](../Motscles/1514014.md) or [Dynamic Automation](../Motscles/1514015.md).

- [Class](../POO/6010006.md). This class must have a constructor without parameter (or with optional parameters).

- [Variant](../Motscles/1514019.md).




Any other type of data (composite variable, constant, ...) is forbidden.

### Declaring an array member in a structure
<a name="declaring_array_member_structure_ELTPARAGRAPHE000147"></a>

- ***Declaring a member whose type is simple array:***
	The array dimensions are fixed when the array is declared. The array dimensions can be modified by [Dimension](../WDLang1/3013022.md)

- ***Declaring a member whose type is dynamic array:***
	The array dimensions must be defined (which means that the array must be allocated) before using the array.




For example:


```wl
// Declare a composite variable
MyCompVar is composed of
	x1 is int
	x2 is dynamic array       // Declare the array
END
 
// Allocate the array
MyCompVar.x2 = new dynamic array of 4,7 int
// Initialize the array
MyCompVar.x2[1,1] = 25
```

### Limits of a composite variable
<a name="limits_composite_variable_ELTPARAGRAPHE000166"></a>

You cannot:

- assign a composite variable to another composite variable directly: each member must be assigned individually.

- compare two composite variables.

- pass a composite variable in parameter to a procedure.

- define an inheritance in a composite variable.

- restrict the access to a member of a composite variable: all members of a composite variable must be public.

### Which "advanced" types can be a member?
<a name="which_advanced_types_can_member_ELTPARAGRAPHE000180"></a>

An "advanced" variable can be a member of another "advanced" variable. The table below presents the different combinations:

| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Fleche_1.gif) | Composite variable | Structure | Class | Array |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Composite variable** | No | No | No | No |
| **Structure** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Class** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Array** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |

### Declaring variables with the same name
<a name="declaring_variables_with_the_same_name_ELTPARAGRAPHE000239"></a>

You cannot declare:

- two variables with the same name (regardless the type of these variables) in a process.

- two members with the same name in the same composite variable.
