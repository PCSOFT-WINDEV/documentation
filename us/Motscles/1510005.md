The **GOTO** statement is used to run a code identified by a given label.

**Important**: The label and the **GOTO** statement must necessarily be defined in the same process.

## Example


```wl
Res = fOpen(FileName, foWrite)
IF Res = -1 THEN GOTO ERROPEN
Res = fWrite(Res, "Process OK")
IF Res = -1 THEN GOTO ERRWRITE
...
RETURN True
ERROPEN: 
Info("The file " + FileName + " cannot be opened. Check its existence.")
RESULT False
ERRWRITE: 
Info("Unable to write into " + FileName)
RESULT False
```

## Syntax

`GOTO <Label name>
...
<Label name>:
<Label code>
`
---

**`<GOTO>: ()`**

Runs the code identified by the label.

**`<Label name>: ()`**

Name of label whose code must be run. This name must be followed by ":". This label and the **GOTO** statement must be found in the same process.

**`<Label code>: ()`**

Code that must be run when **GOTO** calls the label.

<a name="NOTE0_1"></a>

## Remarks




### Label code
<a name="label_code_ELTPARAGRAPHE000070"></a>

Once the code of the label has been run, the program runs the code lines that directly follow the label.
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>




### Limits of labels
<a name="limits_labels_ELTPARAGRAPHE000078"></a>

- Several labels with the same name cannot be used in the same process (or procedure).

- A warning is displayed during the compilation of the project if a label is used by no **GOTO** statement.
