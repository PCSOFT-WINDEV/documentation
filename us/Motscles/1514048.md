## Type of reals
<a name="type_reals_ELTTEXTE000197"></a>
Two types of reals are available in WLanguage: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| <br><br>- ***Real***<br><br><br> | 8-byte real<br>A real can contain up to 15 significant digits. The precision of decimals is not guaranteed. For accurate calculations, use "[Currency](../Motscles/1514043.md)".<br>Value of a real:<br><br>- Minimum value: 1.7\*10-308<br><br>- Maximum value: 1.7\*10+308<br><br><br> |
| <br><br>- ***4-byte real***<br><br><br> | 4-byte real<br>A 4-byte real can contain up to 6 significant digits. The precision of decimals is not guaranteed. For accurate calculations, use "[Currency](../Motscles/1514043.md)".<br>Value of a 4-byte real:<br><br>- Minimum value: 3.4\*10-38<br><br>- Maximum value: 3.4\*10+38<br><br><br><br><br>![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png)![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This type is not supported. It is replaced by a real. |

### Default value
<a name="default_value_ELTPARAGRAPHE000051"></a>

A "Real" variable that is declared but not initialized is equal to 0.

### Binary coding of reals
<a name="binary_coding_reals_ELTPARAGRAPHE000058"></a>

All the **reals** contain the same number of significant digits (15).

If the result of a calculation performed on **reals** involves more than 15 significant digits, this result will be automatically rounded to 15 significant digits. For a better precision, use the [Currency](../Motscles/1514043.md) or [Numeric](../Motscles/1514072.md) type.

### Thousand separator
<a name="thousand_separator_ELTPARAGRAPHE000076"></a>

You can use spaces and underscore characters to separate thousands in numbers. For example: 

```wl
num1 is real
num1 = 123 456.478

num2 is real
num2 = 7_014.478
```

### Problems of precision with the reals
<a name="problems_precision_with_the_reals_ELTPARAGRAPHE000086"></a>

The operations performed with the "real" types are not precise because of the computing representation of reals.

Two reals that are equal mathematically speaking are not necessarily equal computer-wise and the "&gt;", "&lt;" or "=" operators can return results that are "false" mathematically speaking.

To fix some of these problems:

- the "=" operator is accurate to 10e-6 on the reals. Therefore, for two reals that are relatively close, the "=" and "&gt;" operators (or "=" and "&lt;") can return True for the same values.

- the conversion of real values into string uses a complex algorithm. This is why, in most cases, the display by trace is correct.




To avoid these problems, you must use the [Currency](../Motscles/1514043.md) or [Numeric](../Motscles/1514072.md) type that is using an exact memory representation.

### Differences with WINDEV/WEBDEV 5.5
<a name="differences_with_windevwebdev_55_ELTPARAGRAPHE000120"></a>

The types of reals have been modified between WINDEV/WEBDEV 5.5 and WINDEV/WEBDEV 28:

| Type of reals <br>in version 5.5 | Type of reals <br>in version 28 |
| --- | --- |
| Real | 4-byte real |
| Turbo real | Not available anymore |
| Double real | Real |

By default, in WINDEV or WEBDEV 5.5, the reals were coded on 4-byte reals. By default, in WINDEV or WEBDEV 28, the reals are coded on 8-bytes.
