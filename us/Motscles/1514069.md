The **Duration** type is used to easily handle the intervals of dates and times. The DateTime type can be used to perform calculations (subtraction, addition, ...). For more details, see [Operations that can be performed on the Duration type](../Motscles/1514040.md).

**Remarks**:

- Several properties can be used with the **Duration** type, to retrieve the number of days or minutes for example.

- To assign a duration coming from the result of a function, use [StringToDuration](../WDLang1/3027002.md).

- For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

## Example


```wl
StartTime is Time = "1330"
EndTime is Time = "1730"     
ConferenceDuration is Duration = EndTime - StartTime
```

```wl
TaskDuration is Duration = 3 min 30s
```

## Syntax

### Declaring and initializing a variable

`<Variable name> is Duration = <Value>
OR

 <Variable name> is Duration
<Variable name> = <Value>`
---

**`<Variable name>: ()`**

Name of the variable to declare. When several variables of the same type are declared and initialized on the same line, only the last variable is initialized.

**`<Value>: ()`**

In most cases, a duration is the result of an operation performed on [Date](../Motscles/1514066.md), [Time](../Motscles/1514068.md) or [DateTime](../Motscles/1514070.md) variables. 
This value can correspond to: 

- a character string,

- an integer (duration in milliseconds),

- a duration (for example, another duration variable),

- the duration in a readable format (e.g.,: 30 s). 


0 is used to re-initialize the duration.

## Remarks


### Values of a duration
<a name="values_duration_ELTPARAGRAPHE000105"></a>

If a Duration variable is handled: 

- using a string, this string is in the following format: "+DHHMMSSCCC" (days, hours, minutes, seconds, thousandths of a second).  

- using an integer, this integer corresponds to the duration in milliseconds.

- using a duration, this duration can correspond to a Duration variable or to a clear description of the duration. 


In most cases, a duration is the result of an operation performed on [Date](../Motscles/1514066.md), [Time](../Motscles/1514068.md) or [DateTime](../Motscles/1514070.md) variables. This value can be a duration.

0 is used to re-initialize the duration.

### The properties that can be used on the durations
<a name="the_properties_that_can_used_the_durations_ELTPARAGRAPHE000135"></a>

The following properties can be used on the durations: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [InHours](../Proprietes/1000017296.md) | Returns or modifies the number of hours corresponding to a duration. The number of hours is expressed in real format. |
| [InDays](../Proprietes/1000017295.md) | Returns or modifies the number of days corresponding to a duration. The number of days is expressed in real format. |
| [InMilliseconds](../Proprietes/1000017299.md) | Returns or modifies the number of milliseconds corresponding to a duration. The number of milliseconds is expressed in integer format. |
| [InMinutes](../Proprietes/1000017297.md) | Returns or modifies the number of minutes corresponding to a duration. The number of minutes is expressed in real format. |
| [InSeconds](../Proprietes/1000017298.md) | Returns or modifies the number of seconds corresponding to a duration. The number of seconds is expressed in real format. |
| [Time](../Proprietes/2512038.md) | Returns or modifies the number of hours. The number of hours is expressed in integer format. |
| [Day](../Proprietes/2512043.md) | Returns or modifies the number of days. The number of days is expressed in integer format. |
| [Millisecond](../Proprietes/2512062.md) | Returns or modifies the number of milliseconds. The number of milliseconds is expressed in integer format. |
| [Minute](../Proprietes/2512050.md) | Returns or modifies the number of minutes. The number of minutes is expressed in integer format. |
| [Second](../Proprietes/2512081.md) | Returns or modifies the number of seconds. The number of seconds is expressed in integer format. |


For more details on the possible operations on durations (add, subtract, compare), see [Operations that can be performed on the Duration type](../Motscles/1514040.md).

```wl
StartTime is Time = "1330"
EndTime is Time = "1730"     
ConferenceDuration is Duration = EndTime - StartTime
Info("The conference lasted: " + ConferenceDuration.Hour + " hours")
```

**Important**: To store the values of the properties listed in the above table, you must respect the type of variable returned by each property. For example:

```wl
MyDuration is Duration
HowManyHours is real

MyDuration.Day = 5
HowManyHours = MyDuration.InHours

Info(MyDuration.Day + " days = " + HowManyHours + " hours")
```

In this example, the **HowManyHours** variable must be declared as real (and not as integer). If this variable is declared as integer, its value will be approximative.

### Supported values
<a name="supported_values_ELTPARAGRAPHE000207"></a>

The **Duration** type is used to manage the durations included between plus and minus 2 billion days. The precision is up to the millisecond.
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Displaying a duration in an edit control
<a name="displaying_duration_edit_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000214"></a>

To display a duration in an edit control, you have the ability to use [DisplayMask](../Proprietes/1000020008.md). For more details, see [Display mask for durations](../Proprietes/1000020008.md).
