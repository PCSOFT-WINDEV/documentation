## Project configurations
<a name="project_configurations_ELTTEXTE000564"></a>
In the previous lesson, we created a project that can run on both Android and iOS. WINDEV Mobile automatically associated two project configurations to the project, each corresponding to a platform. |   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png)<br> | Note | **Project configurations** make it possible to define the different types of generations supported by the project: Android, iOS, component, etc.<br><br>The project elements can be:<br><br>- common to several configurations (a window used in iOS and Android for example).<br><br>- specific to a configuration (a class used by a component for example).<br><br><br>You can work on a specific configuration at any time: the elements that do not belong to this configuration will be grayed out in the project editor.<br><br>For more details, see [Project configuration](../Editeurs/9000030.md). |







- You can check the different project configurations in the "Project explorer" pane:

	1. Expand "Configurations (iOS application)" at the top of the "Project explorer" pane. 

	2. The two configurations are displayed:

## First Android test and deployment
<a name="first_android_test_and_deployment_ELTTEXTE000606"></a>


### First Android test
<a name="first_android_test_ELTPARAGRAPHE000087"></a>

With WINDEV Mobile, you can test the application directly on the development computer via the simulation mode. This test simulates an Android device on the development computer. This test is useful when the developer has no access to an Android device. However, this test does not allow using the hardware components of the device (GPS, SMS, camera, etc.).|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png)<br> | Note | For Android, WINDEV Mobile also allows you to test the application via the Android emulator (AVD) provided with the SDK. For more details, see [Test with Android emulator](../Editeurs/9000099.md). |







- We will test the WIN_Welcome window in simulation mode in an Android configuration.

	1. Select the Android configuration of your project: 

		- Expand "Configurations (iOS application)" at the top of the "Project explorer" pane. 

		- Double-click the name of the Android configuration. 




2. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_GO_Fen_WM_GAF.jpg)
 in the quick access buttons (or press F9).

3. Validate (if necessary) the information message regarding the simulator mode.

4. The window you created is executed.

5. Click "Display".

6. Validate the system window that appears. 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2_WM%20-%20Mon%20Premier%20Projet2%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.jpg&type=thumb)




- Testing a program is often a long and tedious task. In WINDEV Mobile, you can test the window, report or procedure you are creating with one single click. This is both simple and fast!




- Click the "x" icon in the menu above the simulator box to close the window.




- The WINDEV Mobile editor appears again.

| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png)<br> | Note | In this lesson, we test a window in the simulator. WINDEV Mobile allows you to run several types of tests of the entire application. <br>You can test your application: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_MP%20-%20Go%20test%20Android%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.jpg)<br><br><br>- in the simulator available in WINDEV Mobile: select "![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_ICO_PRJ_Simu_WM_GAF.jpg)<br> Debug on XXXX simulator" in the quick access options. This option allows you to quickly test the project on the PC. This is the option we use in this tutorial. <br><br>- directly on the mobile phone (default option): select "![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_GO_Projet_WM_GAF.jpg)<br> Debug on mobile device" in the quick access options: the generation will be started and the application will be copied and executed on the phone connected to the current computer. You can test the application directly on your device.  <br><br><br> |








### First deployment on an Android device
<a name="first_deployment_android_device_ELTPARAGRAPHE000134"></a>

To run the application in stand-alone mode on the Android device, simply:

- Connect the device via a USB port.

- Generate the application. An "apk" file will be created. This file contains all elements required to run the application on an Android device.

- Select your device at the end of the generation. Copying the application ("apk" file) can take several seconds.




Let's take a look at these different steps.|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png)<br> | Note | **Caution**: USB debugging must be enabled to run tests on the phone. If this operation is not performed, WINDEV Mobile will not detect the phone.<br><br>To enable USB debugging:<br><br>1. On the phone, go to "Settings".<br><br>2. Select "About phone".<br><br>3. Tap "Build Number" multiple times to enable the developer mode.<br><br>4. Go back to the previous menu.<br><br>5. The "Developer Options" entry appears. Select this option.<br><br>6. Check "USB debugging".<br><br><br>Remark: The actions to perform may change across phone versions and manufacturers. For example, in a Samsung Galaxy phone, you must "tap" the "Version number" multiple times in the "About Phone" option to enable "Developer Options". In any case, a Google search with "usb debugging &lt;device name&gt;" allows you to get the operating mode adapted to the device used. |









- To generate the Android application:

	1. On the "Project" tab, in the "Generation" group, click "Generate" (you can also click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_Generation_Android.gif)
 in the quick access buttons).

	2. WINDEV Mobile proposes to select the first project window. In our example, select "WIN_Welcome" and validate ("OK" button). 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2_WM%20-%20Mon%20Premier%20Projet2%20-%20HC%20N%B0004.jpg)


	3. The Android application generation wizard starts.

4. The first step of the wizard is to select the application generation mode. The generation format may change depending on the mode selected. 
			For this tutorial, select "Generate for free deployment (Private Store, fleet of devices, etc.)". Go to the next step. 

5. The next step of the wizard is to check the tools needed to generate the Android application. 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2_WM%20-%20Mon%20Premier%20Projet%20-%20HC%20N%B0007.jpg&type=thumb)
The wizard proposes to:

	- **Download and automatically install the Android SDK and Gradle**: in this case, you will only have to validate the license. WINDEV Mobile takes care of everything. If an update is available, the generation wizard will prompt you to perform the necessary updates. Only an Internet connection is required. This option is only available if you have not previously downloaded and installed Gradle.

	- **Use the tools automatically installed**. This option is available if the tools have been downloaded and installed during a previous generation.

	- **Specify the location of the tools already installed on your computer**. In this case, you just need to specify the installation paths of Gradle and the Android SDK.




That's it, our first application has been generated and run on the Android device.

## First iOS test and deployment
<a name="first_ios_test_and_deployment_ELTTEXTE000762"></a>


### iOS test
<a name="ios_test_ELTPARAGRAPHE000267"></a>

For an iOS application, WINDEV Mobile offers several types of tests: 

- **Project or window test on the development computer using the simulation mode**. This test simulates an iOS device on the development computer. This test is useful if the developer does not have a Mac or an iOS device to compile the application. However, this test does not allow using the hardware components of the device (GPS, SMS, camera, etc.). 

- **Project test directly on the device**. This test is useful when the developer does not have a Mac to compile the application. All the components of the device are accessible. 






- To test the WIN_Welcome window in iOS, in simulation mode: 

	1. Select the iOS configuration of your project: 

		- Expand "Configurations (Android application)" at the top of the "Project explorer" pane. 

		- Double-click the name of the iOS configuration. 




2. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_GO_Fen_WM_GAF.jpg)
 in the quick access buttons (or press F9).

3. Validate (if necessary) the information message regarding the simulator mode.

4. The created window is started in execution, in a shell corresponding to the selected device (iPad or iPhone).

5. Click "Display".

6. Validate the system window that appears.  
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2_WM%20-%20Mon%20Premier%20Projet%2003%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.jpg&type=thumb)






- If you have an iPhone, you can follow the steps below to test the project directly on the device. 




- First, make sure all the following conditions are met: 

	- the iPhone/iPad and the development computer must be on the same network (Wifi, for example). 

	- WMDev must be downloaded to the iPhone/iPad ([https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/WMDev/id1437792304](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/WMDev/id1437792304)). 

	- the following network ports must be open: 

		- 64000 (64000 to 64005 if several WINDEV Mobiles are running simultaneously). 

		- 27280


 If a firewall is used, it must be configured to allow the use of these ports. 




- In the quick access buttons, select "![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_GO_Projet_WM_GAF.jpg)
 Debug on a new iPhone/iPad". The window for connecting to an iOS device appears. This window contains a specific QR code. ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Test_Appli_iOs%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.jpg)


	1. Start WMDev on the mobile device (iPhone or iPad). 

	- Click "+" and then click the button displaying a bar code. 

	- Scan the bar code displayed in WINDEV Mobile in the iOS device connection window. 





### First deployment on an iOS device
<a name="first_deployment_ios_device_ELTPARAGRAPHE000322"></a>

To run the application in stand-alone mode on the device, you must:

- Generate the iOS application (or Xcode project) in WINDEV Mobile.

- Transfer the generated Xcode project to the Mac in order to compile it.

- Compile the project in Xcode in order to generate the program.

- Then, the program can be installed on the connected device or started in the Xcode emulator. It will run in stand-alone mode.Let's take a look at these different steps.






- To generate the iOS application:

	1. On the "Project" tab, in the "Generation" group, click "Generate" (you can also click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_Generation_iOS_WM_GAF.jpg)
 in the quick access buttons).

	2. The wizard for generating an iPhone/iPad application starts.
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2_WM%20-%20Mon%20Premier%20Projet%2003%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.jpg&type=thumb)


	3. The first step of the wizard allows you to:

	- define the application name, the company and the copyright.

	- enter the Bundle ID.
						|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png)<br> | Note | This ID is a unique identifier for Apple applications. It is defined and registered on the Apple developer account.<br><br>This identifier will allow you to register your application so that it can be tested and deployed. By default, WINDEV Mobile automatically generates an identifier that meets Apple's development requirements. You can change this ID. |





	- type the email address that will be used by default to send the error reports generated by the application. 




The other operations must be performed on the Mac. You must:

- Transfer the WINDEV Mobile project to the Mac.

- Compile the project in Xcode.






- To transfer the WINDEV Mobile project to the Mac:

	1. Copy the entire folder generated in the "EXE\\&lt;iOS configuration name&gt;" directory to an external location (USB drive, external hard disk, directory shared with the Mac on the network). The name of this directory is &lt;Project name&gt;.xcode.gen.

	2. Paste this folder on the Mac that will compile the application.

	3. Open the folder on the Mac and open the "Project_name.xcodeproj" file.

	4. The project is opened in Xcode.







WINDEV Mobile automatically generates an Xcode project for your iOS compilations. To simplify the implementation of applications, WINDEV Mobile generates a "Scheme" for Xcode.

- To compile the project in Xcode:

	1. Select the compilation options from the drop-down list in the upper-left corner. Select the scheme (corresponding to your application) then the compilation target (device currently connected or a simulator).

	2. To start the compilation, select "Product .. Clean" then "Product .. Build".

	3. A compilation status report appears at the top ("Succeeded", or the number of warnings and errors). You can click these symbols to see the list of errors/warnings.

	4. Once the program has been compiled without errors, you can start the simulation (select "Product .. Run"). 

		- If the compilation target is the simulator, the application is started in the simulator window. 

		- If the compilation target is the connected device, the application is started on this device. 







You can then test your application directly on your iPhone or iPad.

## Conclusion
<a name="conclusion_ELTTEXTE000828"></a>
WINDEV Mobile allows you to easily create an application. But what is an **Application**?

An **application** is a tool used to automatically perform tasks and actions.

To create an application, WINDEV Mobile proposes to create a **project**. A project links and organizes the different program elements. The program corresponding to the application will be created from the project.

If your application uses data, WINDEV Mobile allows you to define the database structure via the **analysis**. The WINDEV Mobile analysis contains the structure of the data files (known as "Tables" in other databases). These data files will contain the application data.

We will use a project that handles data in [part 4](../TutoWM/1410087571.md) of this tutorial.
