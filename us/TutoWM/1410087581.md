## Creating the report
<a name="creating_the_report_ELTTEXTE000445"></a>


- To create a report: 

	1. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_Nv_WM_GAF.jpg)
 in the quick access buttons.

	2. The new element window appears: click "Report" then "Report". The report creation wizard starts. The report creation wizard shows several types of reports:  
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_MP%20-%20Cr%E9ation%20%E9tat%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.jpg&type=thumb)


	3. Select "Form". Go to the next step.

4. Select the report data source. The report will be based on the Product data file. Select "A data file or existing query". 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_MP%20-%20Cr%E9ation%20%E9tat%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.jpg&type=thumb)
Go to the next step.

5. In the list of data files and queries, select "Product". 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_MP%20-%20Cr%E9ation%20%E9tat%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.jpg&type=thumb)
Go to the next step.

6. Define the data file search key. In our case, the Product data file will be looped through using the product's reference. Select the search key: "Reference". 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_MP%20-%20Cr%E9ation%20%E9tat%20-%20HC%20N%B0004.jpg&type=thumb)
Go to the next step.

7. The wizard allows you to define the data sorting options in the report. By default, the wizard proposes the item used as search key in the data file. 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_MP%20-%20Cr%E9ation%20%E9tat%20-%20HC%20N%B0005.jpg&type=thumb)
Keep the default options and go to the next step.

8. The wizard asks you if you want to insert breaks into the report.

- Select the control corresponding to the product description and move it to the right of the Image control. 




- The bar code of the product is displayed as plain text. We will replace it with a Bar Code control. 

	1. Delete the control that contains the bar code of the product. 

	2. On the "Creation" tab, in the "Data" group, expand "Bar code" and select  "EAN 128". Click in the report below the product description. 

	3. To bind the control to the data file item: 

		- Open the control description window (select "Description" in the context menu).

		- In the "Binding" tab, select "Bar_Code" in the Product data file. 

		- Validate the control description window. 







- Enlarge the product image. 




- Reduce the size of the control that contains the reference and move it below the product image.  




- We will modify the style of the product price so that it is visible in the catalog: 

	1. Move the price control to the right of the Bar Code control. 

	2. Open the control description window (select "Description" in the context menu). 

	3. In the "Style" tab, select the "Main caption" element.

	4. Make the following changes: 

		- In "Size", enter 20. 

		- Check the boxes "B" (Bold) and "I" (Italics). 




5. Validate the description window. 

6. If necessary, enlarge the control to display the entire content.

- Align the "Reorder date" control to the right: 

	1. Select the "Reorder date" control. 

	2. On the "Modification" tab, in the "Quick edit" group, click the "Align right" icon. 

	3. The date is automatically aligned to the right. 









- We will move the "Quantity" and "Reorder date" controls below the price: 

	1. Select the "Quantity" and "Reorder date" controls (and their corresponding items). 

	2. Move them below the bar code. 









- You will get the following report:  
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_MP%20-%20Modification%20%E9tat%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.jpg&type=thumb)
Save the report (Ctrl + S). 




The report is completed. We will now test the report to see the result.

- Run the report by clicking ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_Go_Fenetre_WM.gif)
 in the quick access buttons.

## Printing the report through programming
<a name="printing_the_report_through_programming_ELTTEXTE000547"></a>
Once our report is complete, we will create a menu option in the "WIN_Menu" window to directly print the report.



- To insert a menu into the "WIN_Menu" window:

	1. Open the "WIN_Menu" window in the editor (e.g., double-click on it in the "Explorer" pane).

	2. Select the Multiline Zone control that contains the menu. 

	3. Open the control description window (select "Description" in the context menu). 

	4. In the "General" tab, add a new row between "Map of stores" and "Exit application": 

		- Click "New row". 

		- In the window that appears, select "Simple row with icon". 

		- Click "Finish". 




5. In the Multiline Zone control description, select the new row and move it up one position using the arrows (before "Exit application"). 

6. Validate the description window. 




We will now modify the row we have just inserted. 



- To change the image in the third row of the Multiline Zone control:

	1. Click the Image control in the third row.

	2. Open the image description window (double-click the control).

	3. In the description window:

		- Give a name to the image (e.g., "IMG_Print").

		- Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Menu_Image_Editeur%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)
 on the right of "Image". Select "Catalog" in the context menu that appears to select an image representing the action. 

		- In the image catalog window, enter "Print" in the search box and press Enter.

		- Double-click the image you want to select.

		- In the image configuration window, select a size (80 for example, W (Width) = 80 and H (Height) = 80), give a name to the image (e.g., "Print") and validate.




4. Validate the description window.




- To change the text in the third row of the Multiline Zone control:

	1. Click the Static control in the third row.

	2. Open the description window (double-click the control).

	3. In the "General" tab of the description window:

		- Give a name to the control (e.g., "STC_Print").

		- Change the caption (e.g., "Print catalog").




4. Validate the description window. 

5. The menu appears in the editor. 




- "Print catalog" appears in gray. We will copy the style of "Map of stores" and apply it to our new menu option: 

	1. Select "Map of stores".  

	2. On the "Style" tab, in the "Style and skin template" group, select "Copy style". 

	3. The mouse cursor turns into a brush. 

	4. Click "Print catalog". This style is automatically applied to the control. 







You get the following window:  ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_MP%20-%20Modification%20%E9tat%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.jpg)


- We will change the WLanguage code used to select the Multiline Zone control. 

	1. Select the Multiline Zone control. 

	2. Open the associated WLanguage events (F2). 

	3. Replace the line:
			
		```wl
		CASE 3 // Exit application
				Close()
		```
with:
			
		```wl
		CASE 3 
			iDestination(iGenericPDF)
			RPT_Product.Print()
			// Open file
			ShellExecute(iLastFile())
		CASE 4 // Exit application
			Close()
		```
In this WLanguage code: 

		- [iDestination](../WDLang5/3046074.md) allows you to configure the print destination. In our case (a mobile application), the report we created will be printed as a PDF file using the **iPDFGeneric** constant. 

		- [&lt;Report&gt;.Print](../WDLang5/1000024554.md) prints the RPT_Product report. The corresponding PDF file is created. 

		- [ShellExecute](../WDLang1/3035007.md) displays the generated PDF file in the PDF reader (returned by [iLastFile](../WDLang5/3046068.md)) available on the current device.  




4. Save changes by clicking ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_Sauver_WM_GAF.jpg)
 in the quick access buttons.

5. Close the code window (click the "X" icon in the upper-right corner of the code editor).




- Test the window and its menu options by clicking ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_GO_Fen_WM_GAF.jpg)
 in the quick access buttons. In the simulator, the PDF file of the product catalog is generated and opened in the PDF reader installed in the current computer.
