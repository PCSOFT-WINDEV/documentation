## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000144"></a>
In the previous lessons, we created our first Android and iOS application. After these exercises, we will see the main concepts and the terminology specific to WINDEV Mobile.

## Main concepts

WINDEV Mobile allows you to easily create an application. But what is an **Application**?

An **application** is a tool used to automatically perform tasks and actions.

To create an application, WINDEV Mobile proposes to create a **project**. A project links and organizes the different program elements. The program corresponding to the application will be created from the project.

If your application uses data, WINDEV Mobile allows you to define the database structure via the **analysis**. The WINDEV Mobile analysis contains the structure of the data files (also known as "Tables" in several databases). These data files will contain the application data.|   |   |   |

| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png)<br> | Note | Defining the structure of the data files in the analysis does not mean they are actually created. The data files are physically created when the application is run. |



One or more WINDEV Mobile projects can be linked to the same analysis. This is referred to as shared analysis. For example, an application for business management can be divided into several modules. Each module uses the same analysis (at runtime, each application can also use the same data files).

### Terminology
<a name="terminology_ELTPARAGRAPHE000047"></a>

As already seen, a WINDEV Mobile project (linked to an analysis if necessary) is used to create an application. Before we actually start working with WINDEV Mobile, we will see some specific vocabulary. Some terms are specific to WINDEV Mobile and may not have the same meaning as the terms used in other development environments.

The following terms are used in the **analysis**:

- **Data file**: The analysis allows you to define the structure of the database files. A "Data file" corresponds to a "table" in some databases.
	In WINDEV Mobile, "***Table***" represents a graphic object used to view the content of a data file in a table and/or to enter rows. A table can be used to type the order details for example.

- **Record**: A record is sometimes called row. A data file record corresponds to all items defined for the data file.

- **Item**: In the analysis, an item represents a section of a data file. All items in a data file are used to define the structure of a record.

- **Key/Index**: In WINDEV Mobile and HFSQL, the concept of index is linked to the concept of key. A key is part of the item characteristics. Keys allow fast access to data and simplify loop through operations on data files. In WINDEV Mobile, if an HFSQL data file includes multiple key items, a single index file will be created at runtime.




The following terms are used in **windows and reports**:

- **Window**: Windows make it possible to display or enter information on the screen. Windows are also called "Screens" or "Dialog boxes". Users can directly interact with the windows via controls, buttons, etc.

- **Report**: Reports are used to get a custom view of information. This information can come from the database, text files, controls in the windows, etc. Reports can be generated in PDF in mobile applications. 

- **Control**: "Control" is the term used to identify the different graphic objects displayed in a window or report.

- **Skin template**: Skin templates are used define the application style: visual appearance of windows, buttons, controls, etc.

- **Style**: Styles group the graphic characteristics of an element: background image, borders, font, etc. The styles of the elements in the interface of a WINDEV Mobile application are grouped in a style sheet.
