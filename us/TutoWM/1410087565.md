## Distributing an Android application
<a name="distributing_android_application_ELTTEXTE000235"></a>


### Overview
<a name="overview_ELTPARAGRAPHE000028"></a>

WINDEV Mobile allows you to develop Android applications.

Once the applications are created, developed and checked, all you have to do is deploy them. Several deployment modes are available:

- Deployment via Google Play (or another market).

- Deployment on a Web server.

- Deployment from the PC via ADB.

- Deployment by copying the apk file.

- Deployment via the Private Store provided with WINDEV Mobile. 





### Deployment via Google Play 
<a name="deployment_via_google_play_ELTPARAGRAPHE000041"></a>

Google Play is an online service used to download applications (free of charge or not) on mobiles devices compatible with Android.

Once published, the application can be downloaded by the users all around the world via the Google Play application installed on their phone.

The publication of applications on Google Play must comply with specific rules:

- To publish an application for the first time, you must create a developer account on Google Play. Once registered, you have the ability to publish or update as many applications as you want as many times as necessary.

- The published application must be signed with a private cryptographic key. You have the ability to sign your own application: using a third-party organism is optional. The validity period of the certificate must end after October 23, 2033.
	The applications generated by WINDEV Mobile are automatically signed using the information provided in the generation wizard ("Application signature" step) with a sufficient validity period.
	**Caution**: The published application must not be signed with a generic key (whose use must be limited to the tests in GO mode).

- An icon must be associated with the application. The generation wizard of WINDEV Mobile allows you to define the icon to use.
	**Remark**: Google Play is the best-known application, but there are also other apps.





### Deployment via a Web server
<a name="deployment_via_web_server_ELTPARAGRAPHE000060"></a>

You can make Android applications available for download via a link on a Web page.

To do so, you must:

1. Copy the "apk" file to the Web server that hosts the page from which the application will be downloaded.
	Reminder: the "apk" file is created by WINDEV Mobile when generating the Android application.

2. Add a link in the download Web page. This link has the following format:
	
	```txt
	<a href='Path of the apk file on the server'>Link</a>
	```


3. On the server, add the following MIME type: application/vnd.android.package-archive




The user will only have to display the page with the browser of the phone. The application will be downloaded when the link is clicked. Then, all you have to do is click the downloaded file (in the download manager) to install the application.

**Caution**: The "Unknown sources" option must be enabled on the phone to allow this setup mode. To enable this option, refer to your phone's documentation.


### Deployment from the PC
<a name="deployment_from_the_ELTPARAGRAPHE000079"></a>

Applications can be deployed from the PC directly via the Android Control Center. |   |   |   |

| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png)<br> | Note | **Caution**: USB debugging must be enabled to use the Android Control Center. Otherwise, the phone will not be detected by the Android Control Center.<br><br>To enable USB debugging:<br><br>1. On the phone, go to "Settings".<br><br>2. Select "About phone".<br><br>3. Tap "Build Number" multiple times to enable the developer mode.<br><br>4. Go back to the previous menu.<br><br>5. The "Developer Options" entry appears. Select this option.<br><br>6. Check "USB debugging".<br><br><br>Remark: The actions to perform may change across phone versions and manufacturers. For example, in a Samsung Galaxy phone, you must "tap" the "Version number" multiple times in the "About Phone" option to enable "Developer Options". In any case, a Google search with "usb debugging &lt;device name&gt;" allows you to get the operating mode adapted to the device used. |







To deploy an Android application via the Android Control Center: 

1. Connect the phone to the PC.  

2. Start the Android Control Center: on the "Tools" tab, in the "Mobile Tools" group, click "CCAndroid". 

3. Go to the "Application" tab. This tab lists the applications installed on the device and allows you to install a new application (APK file on the PC). 





### Copying the application to the Mobile device
<a name="copying_the_application_the_mobile_device_ELTPARAGRAPHE000105"></a>

The easiest way to install an Android application on a mobile device is to copy the apk file to the device and run it. The following operations must be performed:

1. Connect the device to the PC by USB.

2. Copy the apk file of the application to the device (external memory, for example).
	Reminder: the "apk" file is created by WINDEV Mobile when generating the Android application.

3. On the device, use a file explorer to go to the directory where the apk file was copied and click the file to start its setup.


**Remark**: Not all devices come with file browsers, but there are many available for free.

**Caution**: The "Unknown sources" option must be enabled on the phone to allow this setup mode. To enable this option, refer to your phone's documentation.


### Deployment via the Private Store provided with WINDEV Mobile
<a name="deployment_via_the_private_store_provided_with_windev_mobile_ELTPARAGRAPHE000120"></a>

With this method, the application can be deployed internally on a fleet of devices. You will be able to manage updates and versions on this fleet of devices.

## Distributing an iOS application
<a name="distributing_ios_application_ELTTEXTE000307"></a>
WINDEV Mobile allows you to develop applications for iOS.

Once the applications are created, developed and checked, all you have to do is deploy them.
There are multiple methods to deploy applications on a device (iPhone or iPad).

- Via the App Store: This type of distribution allows you to distribute your application via the App Store without any restrictions. Your application will include the signature linked to your certificate but it will not be linked to a single device.

- Via a private network (In-House): This type of distribution allows you to distribute your application via a Web server to a group of users working for the same company. You need to enroll as an "Organization" in the Apple Developer Program for this type of distribution. Your application will include the signature linked to your certificate but it will not be linked to a single device.

- Via an Ad Hoc network: This type of distribution allows you to install the application on an Ad Hoc network containing up to 100 devices (iPhone and iPad). The application must be recompiled for the target device by including the certificate for the signature as well as the unique identifier of the device.

- Via the Private Store provided with WINDEV Mobile: With this method, the application can be deployed internally on a fleet of devices. You will be able to manage updates and versions on this fleet of devices. You need to enroll as an "Organization" in the Apple Developer Program for this type of distribution. 




**Caution**: To test and/or deploy the application on an iPhone or iPad, you must enroll in the Apple Developer Program. You need to purchase a membership to enroll. For more information, follow the links below: 

- [https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/](https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/)

- [https://developer.apple.com/programs/whats-included/](https://developer.apple.com/programs/whats-included/)

- [https://developer.apple.com/programs/how-it-works/](https://developer.apple.com/programs/how-it-works/)




There are 2 types of enrollment:

- Apple Developer Program - Individuals

- Apple Developer Program - Organizations




This program includes a developer certificate which allows signing applications to compile and distribute them. This certificate is not free of charge. This developer certificate is required even for a simple setup for test (debug) on a device.
