Once **iSubstBlock** has been run, the following processes will be run when the initial block is printed:

- "Before printing" event of the substitution block.

- print the substitution block.

- "After printing" event of the substitution block.

## Syntax

`iSubstBlock(<Block to substitute> , <New block>)`
---

**`<Block to substitute>: (Character string)`**

Logical name of the block to replace. This name was defined in the report editor, in the block description ("General" tab, "Name" control).

**`<New block>: (Character string)`**

Logical name of the block used for the substitution. This name was defined in the report editor, in the block description. 
If this parameter corresponds to an empty string (""), the current substitution for the &lt;Block to substitute&gt; block is canceled. 
If this parameter is equal to &lt;Block to substitute&gt;, the current substitution is canceled.

## Remarks




### Substituting the first block of the page header
<a name="substituting_the_first_block_the_page_header_ELTPARAGRAPHE000084"></a>

To substitute the first block of the page header, **iSubstBlock** must be used in an initializing event of the report (for example, in one of the events of the document header block or in the "Opening" event of the report). These events will be run before printing this block.

### Substituting the Page Footer block
<a name="substituting_the_page_footer_block_ELTPARAGRAPHE000094"></a>

To avoid display problems, the Page Footer block and its substitution block must have the same height.

### Miscellaneous

- You will get the same result by performing the following operations:

	1. Hide the block ([Visible](../Proprietes/2510138.md) property).

	2. Use [iPrintBlock](../WDLang5/3046030.md).




- To substitute a Page Footer block, we recommend that you use blocks with the same height.

- In most cases, we recommend that you use planes in the report as they are easier to use and to implement (rather than block substitution). For more details, see [The planes](../WDChamp/1013078.md).
