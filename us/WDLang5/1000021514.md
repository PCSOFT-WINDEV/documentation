## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000070"></a>
In prefix syntax, WINDEV and WEBDEV allow you to handle Excel files by **Handling the XLS and XLSX worksheets dynamically**. 

This method is using different types of variables as well as WLanguage functions. This method allows you to manage the Excel files (XLS or XLSX files) **in read and write mode**.

## Handling the XLS and XLSX files dynamically

<a name="NOTE2_2"></a>
To handle the XLS and XLSX files, the WLanguage proposes:

- different types of variables. These types of variables are used to handle an XLS document, an XLS row or column, an XLS cell.

- several WLanguage functions that handle the different types of data.




To handle the XLS and XLSX files:

1. Declare an [xlsDocument](../WDLang5/1000017464.md) variable. This type of variable is used to describe and modify an Excel document.

2. Open (if necessary) the XLS file ([xlsOpen](../WDLang5/3080017.md)) and associate it with the [xlsDocument](../WDLang5/1000017464.md) variable.

3. The different elements in the Excel document can be handled:

	- with the WLanguage functions.

	- with the [xlsDocument](../WDLang5/1000017464.md) properties.







Example:

```wl
MyXLSFile is xlsDocument 
AFile is string 
AFile = fExeDir + "\Business info1.xls"

MyXLSFile = xlsOpen(AFile, xlsWrite)
IF ErrorOccurred = False THEN
	Azz is int = MyXLSFile..Worksheet
	Info("Current worksheet in the Excel file: " + Azz)
	// Change worksheet
	IF MyXLSFile..Worksheet = 2 THEN
		Info("The current worksheet was modified.")
		// Read a cell for test
		Info(xlsData(XLSFileID, 11, 2))
	ELSE
		Error("The selected file does not include a second worksheet!")
	END 
ELSE
	Error("Caution, the file is already opened on a computer!")
END
```

**Remarks**:

- If the Excel file is opened in read/write mode (*xlsWrite* constant), the file is opened and locked until it is closed. To save the modifications performed, use [&lt;xlsDocument variable&gt;.Save](../WDLang5/1000021511.md).

- The XLS functions do not require "Microsoft Excel" to be installed on the user computers.

- The XLS files and the files specific to Office 2007 (.xlsx files) are supported.
