Configures and returns the print destination.

You can print:

- **directly on the printer** ([syntax 1](#SYNTAX1) and [syntax 2](#SYNTAX2)). 
	

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) in a [mini-preview window](../WDChamp/1011094.md) ([syntax 1](#SYNTAX1)).

- **directly in a file** in text, HTM, RTF, PDF, PRN  or XML format ([syntax 3](#SYNTAX3)).
	
	![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) In this version, the print can be performed in a PDF file only.

- **directly a duplicate** ([syntax 4](#SYNTAX4)).

- **directly on a fax** ([syntax 5](#SYNTAX5) and [syntax 6](#SYNTAX6) sending a report to a fax number, for example). For more details, see [Sending faxes](../WDLang3/3037002.md). 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) in the report viewer ([syntax 7](#SYNTAX7)). The user can preview the print result on the screen, page by page. In this viewer, you can:

	- scroll the pages (next page and previous page if they exist),

	- start the print job, 

	- modify the scale of preview,

	- display the first page or the last page,

	- find out the number of the current page, ...







![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) Only the prints in PDF format are available.![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Remark: **iDestination** can also be used to find out the type of print performed (in the report opening code or in the "Before re-printing" code of report). For more details, see [syntax 8](#SYNTAX8).

## Remarks


### When to use iDestination?
<a name="when_use_docparampagetitleshort_ELTPARAGRAPHE000909"></a>

**iDestination** must be the first print function called. It must be called before [iPrint](../WDLang5/3046031.md), [iCreateFont](../WDLang5/3046045.md), etc. However, **iDestination** must be called **after** [iConfigure](../WDLang5/3046072.md) or [iParameter](../WDLang5/3046008.md).

**Remark**: **iDestination** can be called before printing a report (with [iPrintReport](../WDLang5/3046032.md)) to choose the print destination.

### Printing in PDF
<a name="printing_pdf_ELTPARAGRAPHE000964"></a>

The generated PDF file can be directly printed by [iPrintPDF](../WDLang5/1000020519.md).

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) The generated PDF file can be viewed via the [PDF Reader](../WDChamp/1410087036.md) control.

### Printing in HTML
<a name="printing_html_ELTPARAGRAPHE000985"></a>

- If the print is performed in an HTML page with a style sheet (*iHTMLCSS* constant), the style sheet is included in the HTML file. The method for printing in an HTML file is identical to the method for printing on a printer. The layers are supported and the management of the font size is precise.

- If the print is performed in an HTML page without style sheet (*iHTML* constant), the following limitations may occur:

	- management of font size not precise

	- overlay not supported. You cannot write on an image for example.




- The fonts oriented at 90° are not printed properly in the HTML file: the text is displayed with an horizontal font.

- The rounded borders are not printed. They are replaced by standard borders.

### Printing in XLS
<a name="printing_xls_ELTPARAGRAPHE001000"></a>

- The Image, Bar Code and Chart controls are not printed.

### Printing in RTF
<a name="printing_rtf_ELTPARAGRAPHE001009"></a>

- Printing in RTF only supports the text (with its style) and the images. The overlay of objects is not supported (lines or images). Several text lines cannot be displayed beside an image for example.

- The fonts oriented at 90° are not printed properly in the HTML file: the text is displayed with an horizontal font.

- To print in RTF, the "RICHED20.DLL" file must be found on the current computer. In most cases, the "RICHED20.DLL" file is in the Windows system directory.

- The borders are not printed.

- The tables are supported by the RTF format. The font color and the background color of cells are stored.

### Configuring the printer for printing in HTML, RTF and text format
<a name="configuring_the_printer_for_printing_html_rtf_and_text_format_ELTPARAGRAPHE001024"></a>

- If the print is performed in a **text file**, only the text is retrieved: the lines, the images, ... are ignored.

- Printing in HTML, RTF or text format depends on the configuration and on the resolution of the current printer. Therefore, if the current printer is configured in landscape mode with margins, these options will be used when printing in HTML, text or RTF format.

- The finer the printer resolution is, the better the quality of the RTF, text or HTML print will be.

- **To avoid the overlapping problems** when printing in HTML mode, you have the ability to adjust the printer settings.

### Printing in PRN format
<a name="printing_prn_format_ELTPARAGRAPHE001039"></a>

When printing in PRN format, the PRN file is specific to the selected printer. This file is directly created by the printer driver, it is a binary file that can be interpreted by the printer.

This file can be printed thereafter on the specified printer or on any other printer of the same type via the "Print" command of DOS. The syntax of this command is:


```txt
Print /D:\\<Computer name>\<Name of declared printer> <Name of PRN file>
```

**Example**:


```txt
Print /D:\\Doc_Computer\CanonLBP Output.prn
```

**Remark**: For a network printer, you must use the share name instead of the printer name. The share name is found in the "Share" tab of printer description.

### Printing in XML
<a name="printing_xml_ELTPARAGRAPHE001058"></a>

When printing in XML format, only the data is printed. The characteristics of the page layout (lines, ...) are ignored.

### Printing on a fax
<a name="printing_fax_ELTPARAGRAPHE001083"></a>

Two syntaxes can be used to send a print to a fax:

- **Fax without management of status report**. The print (performed later by [iPrintReport](../WDLang5/3046032.md) for example) is directly sent to the specified phone number.

- **Fax with management of status code**. The print (performed thereafter by [iPrintReport](../WDLang5/3046032.md) for example) is sent to the specified phone number, via a fax server. **iPreview** returns the identifier of connection to this fax server. This identifier, as well as the name given to the fax, allow you to check the status of the outgoing fax with the [Fax functions](../WDLang3/3037003.md). For more details, see [Sending faxes](../WDLang3/3037002.md).

### Printing a fax in landscape mode
<a name="printing_fax_landscape_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE001107"></a>

To configure the print of a fax in landscape mode (printing several faxes, including one in landscape mode), the print functions must be used in the following order:

1. **iDestination** associated with the *iFax* constant.

2. [iParameter](../WDLang5/3046008.md) used to switch to landscape mode.




If this order is not respected, the setting of landscape mode will be ignored by the driver for fax management.

Example:


```wl
iDestination(iFax, "00046032032","Fax")
iParameter("ORIENTATION=LANDSCAPE")
iPrint("Print in landscape mode")
iEndPrinting()
```

### Using a fax server installed on a computer other than the current computer
<a name="using_fax_server_installed_computer_other_than_the_current_computer_ELTPARAGRAPHE001129"></a>

You have the ability to use a fax server installed on a computer other than the current computer. In this case, the computer where the fax server is installed must be running Windows Server 2003. The fax server must be shared. Then, the name of fax server must be specified in **iDestination**.

The computer from which the faxes will be sent must be equipped with a local fax server.

For example, if the fax server is installed on "FaxServer1", use the following syntax:


```wl
iDestination(iFax, "00046032032","Fax","\\FaxServer1\Fax_Share")
```

<a name="NOTE0_12"></a>
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png)![User code (UMC)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/MCU.png) 

### End of print
<a name="end_print_ELTPARAGRAPHE001146"></a>

[iEndPrinting](../WDLang5/3046053.md) must necessarily be called to end the print except after a call to [iPrintReport](../WDLang5/3046032.md).

The next prints will be performed on the printer except if **iDestination** is run again.
