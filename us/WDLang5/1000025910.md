### Properties specific to Document variables
<a name="properties_specific_document_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000035"></a>

The following properties can be used to handle **xlsDocument** variables:

| Property name | Type used | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTMLContent | Character string | HTML content of the document encoded in UTF-8.  |
| RootNode | [htmlNode](../WDLang5/1000026081.md) variable | Array of root nodes. |


<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>
Remarks: 

- The "." operator is used to access the root "html" element.

- Empty documents are created with the "html" element.

- An HTML document contains a single [htmlNode](../WDLang5/1000026081.md) element named "html".. 




- You can loop through all the elements of a document using "FOR EACH x OF DocumentVariable IN-DEPTH".
