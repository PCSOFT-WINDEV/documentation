The **fbSession** type is used to describe a connection to the Facebook service and to manage the authentication to this service. The characteristics of this connection can be defined and changed using different WLanguage properties. 

**Important: Before using this WLanguage type, the application must be declared to Facebook**. For more details, see [Using Facebook authentication](../WDLang5/1000021926.md). 

**Remarks**: 

- For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

- This type of variable is available in Linux only for WEBDEV sites.
