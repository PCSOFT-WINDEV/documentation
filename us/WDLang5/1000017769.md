The **rssChannel** type is used to handle an RSS channel. The characteristics of the channel can be defined and changed using different WLanguage properties.

This type of variable is used by the [rssStream](../WDLang5/1000017795.md) type.

**Remarks**:

- In most cases, the declaration of an **rssStream** variable is not required. The properties of [rssStream](../WDLang5/1000017795.md) allow you to directly handle the properties of the **rssChannel** type (especially the **Channel** property).

- For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).
