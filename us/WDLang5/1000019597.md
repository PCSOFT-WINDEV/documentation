## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000272"></a>
WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile allow you to print bar codes. You can use:

- a "Bar code" control in a report.

- [iPrintBarCode](../WDLang5/3046020.md) in a print performed in WLanguage.

## Printing a bar code from a report
<a name="printing_bar_code_from_report_ELTTEXTE000296"></a>
The report editor proposes a "Bar code" control. The Bar Code control can be directly bound to an item in the data source of the report.

Bar Code controls can be configured in the description window ("Description" option on the context menu).

Different characteristics can be set according to the type of bar code:

- bar codes with check: the last character of the bar code corresponds to a control character.

- extended bar code: the value of the bar code can contain the 128 characters found in the ASCII code.

- displaying (or not) the value of the bar code.

- management of formatting.

- management of control characters and management of character set.




**Regardless of the type of bar code**, you can also:

- configure the size of the bar code.

- configure the characteristics of the border.

- manage the orientation of the bar code.




To print the bar code, assign the value of the bar code to the Bar Code control. 


![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) **Special case: QR Code: the types proposed by default**
In a report, you can print a QR Code. Then, this QR will be decoded by an application that will propose a specific action according to the type of the QR Code. 

The assignment mode of the Bar Code control depends on its type. 

By default, the description window of the control in the report editor proposes 4 simple types: 

- a **Text QR Code**: This type of QR Code is used to associate a text with the bar code. To initialize this type of QR Code, all you have to do is assign it with a character string. For example: 
	
	```wl
	BAC_QRCode = "I am a simple text"
	```


- a **Web Link QR Code**: This type of QR Code is used to directly open a site. To initialize this type of QR Code, all you have to do is assign it with a site address. For example: 
	
	```wl
	BAC_QRCode = "http://www.windev.com"
	```


- a **Phone Number QR Code**: This type of QR Code is used to directly call a phone number. To initialize this type of QR Code, all you have to do is assign it with a phone number. For example: 
	
	```wl
	BAC_QRCode = "010203040506"
	```


- an **Email Address QR Code**: This type of QR Code is used to get the email address of a contact. To initialize this type of QR Code, simply assign an email address to it. For example: 
	
	```wl
	BAC_QRCode = "doc@pcsoft.fr"
	```




![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) **Special case: QR Code: the specific types**
You can also print QR codes (SMS, contact, geographic position, etc.). In this case, the data must be assigned to the Bar Code control using the [BarCode](../WDLang5/1000019451.md) type. 

You must: 

1. Define a variable of type [BarCode](../WDLang5/1000019451.md): 
	
	```wl
	MyBarCode is BarCode
	```


2. In the [BarCode](../WDLang5/1000019451.md) variable, specify the type of content of the QR Code (for example, for an SMS barcode): 
	
	```wl
	MyBarCode.TypeBarCode = BC_QRCode
	MyBarCode.ContentType = bcTypeSMS
	```


3. Depending on the type of bar code, fill the corresponding element (see table below): 
	

| Type of content | Type of value (Content property) | Remark |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *bcTypeText* | Character string | Example: "WINDEV is great!" |
| *bcTypePhone* | Character string | Example: "0612345678" |
| *bcTypeSMS* | Character string in the following format: <br>&lt;Number&gt; + CR + &lt;Message&gt;<br><br><br>If they are specified, the members of the [SMS structure](../WDLang3/3068003.md) (SMS.Message and SMS.Number) will be automatically taken into account. | Example: "0612345678&lt;CR&gt;Text to send" |
| *bcTypeURL* | Character string | Example: "http://www.google.com" |
| *bcTypeEmail* | Character string | Example: "name@email.com" |
| *bcTypeContact* | Empty. The members of the [mContact structure](../WDLang3/1000006111.md) will be automatically taken into account. |   |
| *bcTypeLocation* | [geoPosition](../WDLang3/1000019191.md) variable.<br><br>The **Latitude** and **Longitude** properties of the variable will be automatically taken into account. |   |

## Printing a bar code in WLanguage
<a name="printing_bar_code_wlanguage_ELTTEXTE000332"></a>
To print a bar code in WLanguage, you must use [iPrintBarCode](../WDLang5/3046020.md). 
[iPrintBarCode](../WDLang5/3046020.md) proposes two syntaxes: 

- syntax used to print a bar code directly (this syntax does not support QR Codes):
	
	```txt
	iPrintBarCode(<Value>, <Type>, <Coordinates of rectangle>, <Characteristics>)
	```

	The parameters are as follows:

	- the value of the bar code. This value can be printed below the bar code.

	- the type of the bar code to print.

	- the coordinates (in pixels) of the rectangle in which the bar code will be printed. 

	- the characteristics of the bar code (if necessary).







- syntax used to print a bar code in a variable of type [BarCode](../WDLang5/1000019451.md) (this syntax supports QR Codes):
	
	```txt
	iPrintBarCode(<BarCodes Variable>, <Coordinates of rectangle>)
	```

	All the parameters of the bar code to print are specified in the [BarCode](../WDLang5/1000019451.md) variable. 




Regardless of the syntax used: 

- The bar code is printed in an invisible rectangle. This rectangle is used to specify the position and size of the bar code to print.

- "EAN" and "UPC" bar codes have proportional width and height. To enlarge these bar codes, it is necessary to increase both height and width.

- [iEndPrinting](../WDLang5/3046053.md) must be used to start the actual print. This function must be the last print function used.




The following example presents the click code of a button used to print a EAN 13 bar code. The value of the bar code is retrieved in the edit control named "EDT_EditBC".


```wl
iPrintWord("EAN 13 bar code:") 
iPrintBarCode(EDT_EditBC, BC_EAN13, 10, 10, 50, 100) 
iEndPrinting()
```


The following example allows you to print a QR Code: 


```wl
MyQRCode is BarCode
MyQRCode.Content = "http://www.windev.com"
MyQRCode.ContentType = bcTypeText
MyQRCode.TypeBarCode = BC_QRCODE
iPrintBarCode(MyQRCode, 10, 20, 50, 60)
iEndPrinting()
```
