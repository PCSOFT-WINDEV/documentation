## Remarks


### Google Cloud Print
<a name="google_cloud_print_ELTPARAGRAPHE000056"></a>

Google Cloud Print is a free service that is used to send, on the Google servers, the files that will be printed on the preset printers. Therefore, the print is performed via Internet.

To use the Google Cloud Print service: 

1. Configure the printers on the site of Google Cloud Print. 

2. In the application, use **GglPrintDocument**. 




For more details, see the site about the use conditions of Google Cloud Print service : [http://www.google.com/cloudprint](http://www.google.com/cloudprint).

### Operating mode on the phone
<a name="operating_mode_the_phone_ELTPARAGRAPHE000075"></a>

**GglPrintDocument** opens several pages in the current application. 

- If the user is not connected, a page for connecting to Google is displayed. In this page, you must type the login and password of the Google account that was used to define the printers. 

- A page proposes the different available printers. All you have to do is select the requested printer to define the print options and to start the final print.
