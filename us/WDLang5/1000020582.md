### Printing a report identified by its name

`<Result> = iGroupPrint([<Report to be printed>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Type of result returned by the report (optional))`**

Value returned by printing the report. This value is returned: 

- by the [RETURN](../Motscles/1510007.md) keyword used in the report closing code. 

- by [ReturnedValue](../Proprietes/2510134.md) used before closing the report.




**`<Report to be printed>: (Report name)`**

Name of report to print. In the report viewer, a checkmark will be displayed in front of the caption of this report. This report was added into the group by [iGroupAdd](../WDLang5/1000020580.md).

If this parameter is not specified, the printed report corresponds to: 

- the last report of the group chosen by the user in the report viewer. 

- the first report of the group (in the order of addition with [iGroupAdd](../WDLang5/1000020580.md)) if the report viewer has never been started.
