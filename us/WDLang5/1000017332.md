Manages authentication on a Google server (via the "OAuth 2.0" authentication mode). This function is automatically run when running a Gglxxx function. 

**Remarks**: 

- We recommend that you use **GglConnect** (syntax 2) to group the authorizations requests made by Google. 

- The disconnection is automatically performed when closing the application.

## Example

```wl
// Connection by using the "OAuth 2.0" authentication mode

Cnt.ClientSecret = "S13DCA6KkYh1EgPv9-jLxxxh" 
// During the connection, the user will have to validate the services used
// (For more details, see the additional examples)

---

<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Connecting by specifying the services used

`<Result> = GglConnect(<Google connection> , <Google service>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the authentication was performed,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if a problem occurs. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md).




**`<Google connection>: (gglConnection variable)`**

Name of the variable of type [gglConnection](../WDLang5/1000018009.md) to be used.

**`<Google service>: (Integer constant (or combination of constants))`**

Google service to enable (the application must access these services): 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *gglServiceCalendar* | "Google Calendar" service: Google calendar |
| *gglServiceContacts* | "Google Contacts" service: Management of Google contacts |
| *gglServiceDocuments* | "Google Documents List" service: Management of documents |
| *gglServicePicasa* | "Picasa" service |

## Remarks


### Possible error cases: 
<a name="possible_error_cases_ELTPARAGRAPHE000122"></a>

- The Internet connection is not valid.

- The authentication was not performed properly.

### Prerequisites for OAuth 2.0 authentication 
<a name="prerequisites_for_oauth_20_authentication_ELTPARAGRAPHE000136"></a>

To connect with the OAuth 2.0 authentication, the application must be declared on your Google developer console: [https://developers.google.com/console](https://developers.google.com/console). 
In the console: 

1. Click "Create a project". Give the name of your project. An identifier is automatically proposed for your project. 

2. Validate

3. The project is created. 

4. In the menu on the left, click "API and authentication" then "API". 

5. Choose the services required by the application: 

	- To access the calendars, choose "Calendar API" ("Google Apps APIs" category). 

	- To access the contacts, choose "Contacts API" ("Google Apps APIs" category). 

	- To access the Google documents, choose "Drive API" ("Google Apps APIs" category). 

	- To access the Picasa albums and the documents, there is no need to select a specific API. 




6. In the menu on the left, click "Identifiers". 

7. Then, click the "Create a client identifier" button. 

	- Select the type of application: "Application installed".

	- The authorization screen must be configured during the first creation of client identifier.   

	- In the authorisation screen, in the "Product name" area, enter the name of your application for example. 

	- Click "Save". 

	- The screen for creating the client identifier is re-displayed. 

		- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) For WINDEV applications, select "Installed application", then "Other".




- Validate. The client identifiers are created: 

	- Client identifier. This identifier must be stored. It will be used in the [gglConnection](../WDLang5/1000018009.md) variable. 

	- Secret code of client. This identifier must be stored. It will be used in the [gglConnection](../WDLang5/1000018009.md) variable. 

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Redirection URI. Check whether "http://localhost" is specified.

### OAuth 2.0 authentication
<a name="oauth_20_authentication_ELTPARAGRAPHE000214"></a>

The call to **GglConnect** triggers: 

1. The opening of a login window for the end user. If the **Email** property of the [gglConnection](../WDLang5/1000018009.md) variable is specified, Google pre-populates the connection window with the specified email address. The login window is not displayed if the user is already connected. 

2. The opening of the authorisation window. The end user must allow the application to access his account. This window is automatically closed when the user accepts or cancels. 




Remarks:

- If the syntax 1 is used (connection with basic authentication), an authorization window will be displayed whenever an attempt is performed to access a new service. 

- If the syntax 2 is used (connection by specifying the services used), an authorization window will be displayed for all the services requested at the beginning of the application. 

- The authorization window can be displayed during the first application start if the persistence of connection is managed (see next paragraph). 





<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Connection persistence
<a name="connection_persistence_ELTPARAGRAPHE000258"></a>

When connecting to the Google services, the authentication tokens are not saved. It is therefore necessary to log in again and allow access to the application each time it is run (i.e. each time a "blank" [gglConnection](../WDLang5/1000018009.md) variable is used). 

In order for the access authorization to be persistent, all you have to do is call the serialization functions of WLanguage. 

Example for implementing the persistence by using an XML file: 

```wl
let sAuthPersistenceFile = SysDir(srLocalAppData) + [fSep] + "gglauth.xml"

cnt is gglConnection
// If connection already established
IF fFileExist(sAuthPersistenceFile) THEN 
	// Restore the connection 
	let bufDeserialize = fLoadBuffer(sAuthPersistenceFile) 
	Deserialize(cnt, bufDeserialize, psdXML) 
ELSE 
	// New connection 
	cnt.Email = "email@gmail.com" 
	cnt.ClientID = "387756281032-qffa6dajjd5348iqhi558xxxxxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com" 
	cnt.ClientSecret = "Sxxxxx-jLMwwh" 
END 

IF GglConnect(cnt, gglCalendarService) THEN 
	// Save the connection in order to re-use it later 
	bufSerialize is Buffer 
	Serialize(cnt, bufSerialize, psdXML) 
	fSaveBuffer(sAuthPersistenceFile, bufSerialize) 
END
```

Remark: The authentication tokens of a **gglConnection** variable can be cleared via [GglDisconnect](../WDLang5/1000021451.md).
