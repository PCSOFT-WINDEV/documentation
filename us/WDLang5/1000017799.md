The **rssImage** type is used to describe the image of a RSS stream. The characteristics of this image can be defined and changed using different WLanguage properties.  

This type of variable is used by the [rssStream type](../WDLang5/1000017795.md).

**Remarks**:

- In most cases, the declaration of a **rssImage** variable is not required. Indeed, the properties of the [rssStream type](../WDLang5/1000017795.md) allow you to directly handle the properties of the rssImage type (especially the .Image property).

- For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).
