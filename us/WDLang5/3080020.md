## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000186"></a>
WINDEV and WEBDEV propose two methods to handle Excel files:

- **Method 1**: **Handling the XLS and XLSX worksheets dynamically** 
	This method is using different types of variables as well as WLanguage functions. This method allows you to manage the Excel files (XLS or XLSX files) **in read and write mode**. 

- **Method 2** (kept for backward compatibility): Using the WLanguage functions to manage the XLS functions. 
	This method allows you **to manage the XLS files in read mode**.

## Method 1: Handling the XLS and XLSX files dynamically
<a name="method_1_handling_the_xls_and_xlsx_files_dynamically_ELTTEXTE000210"></a>
<a name="NOTE2_2"></a>
To handle the XLS and XLSX files, the WLanguage proposes:

- different types of variables. These types of variables are used to handle an XLS document, an XLS row or column, an XLS cell.

- several WLanguage functions that handle the different types of data.




To handle the XLS and XLSX files:

1. Declare an [xlsDocument](../WDLang5/1000017464.md) variable. This type of variable is used to describe and modify an Excel document.

2. Open (if necessary) the XLS file ([xlsOpen](../WDLang5/3080017.md)) and associate it with the [xlsDocument](../WDLang5/1000017464.md) variable.

3. The different elements in the Excel document can be handled:

	- with the WLanguage functions.

	- with the [xlsDocument](../WDLang5/1000017464.md) properties.







Example:

```wl
XLSFileID is xlsDocument 
AFile is string 
AFile = fExeDir + "\Business info1.xls"

XLSFileID = xlsOpen(AFile, xlsWrite)
IF ErrorOccurred = False THEN
	Azz is int = xlsCurrentWorksheet(XLSFileID)
	Info("Current worksheet in the Excel file: " + Azz)
	// Change worksheet
	IF xlsCurrentWorksheet(XLSFileID, 2) THEN
		Info("The current worksheet was modified.")
		// Read a cell for test
		Info(xlsData(XLSFileID, 11, 2))
	ELSE
		Error("The selected file does not include a second worksheet!")
	END 
ELSE
	Error("Caution, the file is already opened on a computer!")
END
```
**Remarks**:

- If the Excel file is opened in read/write mode (*xlsWrite* constant), the file is opened and locked until it is closed. To save the modifications performed, use [xlsSave](../WDLang5/1000018057.md).

- The XLS functions do not require "Microsoft Excel" to be installed on the user computers.

- The XLS files and the files specific to Office 2007 (.xlsx files) are supported.

## Method 2: Reading the Excel files (method kept for backward compatibility)
<a name="method_2_reading_the_excel_files_method_kept_for_backward_compatibility_ELTTEXTE000240"></a>
WINDEV and WEBDEV propose several functions allowing you to manage your ".XLS" files from your WINDEV applications and from your WEBDEV sites. These functions allow you to retrieve the data entered in Excel.

**To handle an XLS document:**

1. Use [xlsOpen](../WDLang5/3080017.md). This function returns the identifier of the XLS file used.

2. Use the XLS functions to retrieve the requested information about the Excel file and its data.




**Remarks**:

- The XLS functions do not require "Microsoft Excel" to be installed on the user computers.

- Only the XLS files are supported. The files specific to Office 2007 (.xlsx files) are not supported.

- Two operating modes are available for the XLS functions:

	- **Operating mode compatible with the earlier versions** of WINDEV and WEBDEV: in this mode, only the first worksheet of the workbook can be accessed.

	- **New multi-sheet operating mode**: in this mode, you have the ability to select the worksheet where the operations are performed.







The function used to modify the mode for handling the XLS functions is named [xlsOpen](../WDLang5/3080017.md).

## WLanguage functions
<a name="wlanguage_functions_ELTTEXTE000264"></a>
These functions are used to:

- handle the ".XLS" files: opening and closing.

- get information about your ".XLS" files: data of a cell, number of rows, number of columns, type of column, title of column (see the diagram).

- find out the Excel version used.

- identify the errors that occurred during the operations performed on an ".XLS" file.

See [XLS functions](../WDLang5/3080009.md) to find out the list of functions that can be used with a ".XLS" file.
