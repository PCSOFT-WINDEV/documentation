| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ER.png) | Important | With Reports & Queries, you can print a report via one of the following options:<br><br>- by printing directly (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Ico_Imprimer.gif)).<br><br>- by opening the report test window (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Ico_Go_Fenetre_WD_bl.gif)).<br><br><br>Therefore, no programming is required to print the report.<br><br>In order for the reports created in Reports & Queries to be directly printed from a WINDEV application, this feature must be implemented by the provider of WINDEV application.<br><br>The provider can for example include a window allowing the end user to:<br><br>- select a report created in Reports & Queries.<br><br>- run this report.<br><br><br> |

## Syntax

`<Result> = <Report>.Print([<Parameter 1> [... [, <Parameter N>]]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Type of result returned by the report (optional))`**

Value returned by printing the report. This value is returned: 

- by the [RETURN](../Motscles/1510007.md) keyword used in the report closing code. 

- by [ReturnedValue](../Proprietes/2510134.md) used before closing the report.




**`<Report>: (Report name)`**

Name of the report, defined in the report editor.

**`<Parameter 1>: (Optional parameters (the type corresponds to the parameter type))`**

Optional parameter expected by the report. This parameter was defined in the report opening code. This parameter can be the name of a view, the name of a memory area, etc.
**Caution**: If lower bounds and upper bounds have been specified for the report, the first two parameters must correspond the lower bound and to the upper bound (respectively).



**`<Parameter N>: (Optional parameters (the type corresponds to the parameter type))`**

Optional parameter expected by the report. This parameter was defined in the report opening code. This parameter can be the name of a view, the name of a memory area, etc.
**Caution**: If lower bounds and upper bounds have been specified for the report, the first two parameters must correspond the lower bound and to the upper bound (respectively).

## Remarks


### Principle for printing a report
<a name="principle_for_printing_report_ELTPARAGRAPHE000382"></a>

**&lt;Report&gt;.Print** reads the report data source (data files, query, Table control, etc.). **&lt;Report&gt;.Print** prints the *Body* block for each record. The other blocks are printed when necessary:

- The *Start of document* block will be printed at the beginning of the document.

- The *End of document* block will be printed at the end of the document.

- The *Page header* block will be printed at the top of each page.

- The *Page footer* block will be printed at the bottom of each page.

- If there is a break, the *Body* block of the break will be located between the *Break header* block and the *Break footer* block.



<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Report with lower and upper bounds
<a name="report_with_lower_and_upper_bounds_ELTPARAGRAPHE000402"></a>

If the lower and upper bounds were specified when the report was created in the report editor, the first two parameters passed to the report via **&lt;Report&gt;.Print** must correspond to the lower bound and to the upper bound, respectively.

Example: a report was created on Customer file. This report browses the file on the "CustomerNum" key item. This report was defined as being bounded, with specified minimum and maximum bounds ("Data" tab in the report description window. 

The following code is used to print the report for customers 2 to 5: 

```wl
iDestination(iViewer)
RPT_Customers_Prospects.Print("2", "5")
```

<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Executing a query and a report based on this query
<a name="executing_query_and_report_based_this_query_ELTPARAGRAPHE000424"></a>

When printing a report based on a query, if the query has already been executed, it is not executed again. To re-execute the query (to add records, for example), simply use [&lt;Source&gt;.ExecuteQuery](../WDLang4/1000024944.md) or [&lt;Report&gt;.InitQuery](../WDLang5/1000025143.md).
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Print destination
<a name="print_destination_ELTPARAGRAPHE000444"></a>

You can set the print destination of the report using [iDestination](../WDLang5/3046074.md).

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) [iDestination](../WDLang5/3046074.md) with the *iViewer* constant is used to display the printout in a report viewer. The user can then select the printing mode (PDF, printer, etc.). To find out whether the print job was started from the report viewer, use [iDocumentPrinted](../WDLang5/3046029.md).
<a name="NOTE0_5"></a>
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png)![User code (UMC)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/MCU.png) 

### Passing parameters
<a name="passing_parameters_ELTPARAGRAPHE000468"></a>

The parameters specified by **&lt;Report&gt;.Print** correspond to the parameters defined in the report opening code via the following syntax:


```txt
PROCEDURE <ReportName> (<NameParam1>, <NameParam2> = "<DefaultValue>", ...
	<NameParamN> = "<DefaultValue>")
```
**Reminder**: Some of the parameters passed to a procedure can be optional parameters. When declaring the procedure, the optional parameters must be described in last position (on the right), with a default value preceded by the "=" sign. For more details, see [Procedure parameters](../Motscles/1513001.md).

If the report is based on a query, [&lt;Report&gt;.InitQuery](../WDLang5/1000025143.md) must be used to pass the query parameters before printing the report.
<a name="NOTE0_6"></a>


### Printing a component report
<a name="printing_component_report_ELTPARAGRAPHE000493"></a>To print a component report, use the name of component report (the component being included in the project). For example:

```wl
ComponentReport.Print()
```


If a conflict occurs with a project element, the element name must be prefixed by the component name. For example:

```wl
MyComponent.Report.Print()
```


To use the report name in a variable, specify the component name. For example:

```wl
sReport is string = "MyComponent.MyReport"
sReport.Print()
```

<a name="NOTE0_8"></a>


### Nested reports
<a name="nested_reports_ELTPARAGRAPHE000525"></a>

You can call **&lt;Report&gt;.Print** within the same report. For more details, see the help about the [Nested reports](../WDChamp/1011001.md).
