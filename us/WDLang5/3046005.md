Returns: 

- Returns the list of nested reports currently printed (reports run by [iPrintReport](../WDLang5/3046032.md) in one of the processes of the report currently printed). 

- the list of sequenced reports currently printed ([iSequencingAdd](../WDLang5/1000020059.md)).




**Remark**: This function is used to find out: 

- the name of the different reports printed from the report currently printed (called nested reports). This list is built while the nested reports are printed.

- the name of sequenced reports. The list of sequenced reports is known as soon as the first report is printed.




**Caution**: A specific configuration is required to use this function in Linux. For more details, see [Printing in Linux](../Editeurs/9000078.md).
