Performs a search in an XML document. This search can be canceled by [XMLCancelSearch](../WDLang5/3081001.md).

Remark: To perform an XPath query, use [XMLExecuteXPath](../WDLang5/3081015.md).

```wl
// Search from current position
XMLFind("XMLDoc", "pri", XMLTag + XMLChildItem, XMLStartWith)
WHILE XMLFound("XMLDoc") = True
	Info("Tag found " + XMLElementName("DocXML"))
	// Next element in the search
	XMLNext("XMLDoc")
END
XMLCancelSearch("XMLDoc")
// Positions at the root of document
XMLRoot("XMLDoc")
// Exact-match search from the beginning of document
XMLFind("XMLDoc", "price", XMLTag + XMLContinue, XMLExact)
WHILE XMLFound("XMLDoc") = True
	Info("Tag found " + XMLElementName("DocXML"))
	// Next element in the search
	XMLNext("XMLDoc")

## Syntax

`<Result> = XMLFind(<XML document> , <Sought value> [, <Type of iteration> [, <Search options>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the sought element is found,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise.




**`<XML document>: (Character string)`**

Name of the XML document used. This document contains the XML code to study and it was created by [XMLDocument](../WDLang5/3081008.md).

**`<Sought value>: (Character string (with quotes) or NULL keyword)`**

Value sought in the XML document.

If this parameter is set to NULL, all the tags and attributes of the XML document will be read from the current element, according to the search criteria.

**`<Type of iteration>: (Optional constant (or combination of constants))`**

Type of iteration to perform: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *XMLAttribute* | Search performed on the names of attributes. |
| *XMLChildItem* | Search performed in all the child tags. Must be combined with *XMLTag*, *XMLAttribute* or *XMLValue*. |
| *XMLContinue* | <br><br>- Combined with *XMLTag*, *XMLAttribute* or *XMLValue*, continues the search in the rest of document while moving up in the levels of the tree structure (if necessary).<br><br>- Combined with *XMLChildItem*, continues the search in the rest of the document while moving up and down in the levels of the tree structure.<br><br><br> |
| *XMLCurrentLevel* | Search performed in the current level of tree structure. |
| *XMLElement*<br>(Default value) | Search performed on the names of tags and attributes (equivalent to *XMLTag* + *XMLAttribute*). |
| *XMLTag* | Search performed on the names of tags. |
| *XMLValue* | Search performed on the values of tags and attributes. |



**`<Search options>: (Optional constant (or combination of constants))`**

Search options that will be taken into account: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *XMLContains* | Search performed on the elements containing the sought value. |
| *XMLExact*<br>(default value) | Exact-match and case-sensitive search. |
| *XMLIgnoreCase* | Search ignoring the case of the tag. Can be combined with *XMLContains*, *XMLStartWith* or *XMLExact*. |
| *XMLStartWith* | Search performed on the elements starting with the sought value. |
| *XMLWithNamespace* | Search performed on the elements containing a namespace.<br> |

## Remarks


### Searching and browsing XML documents
<a name="searching_and_browsing_xml_documents_ELTPARAGRAPHE000149"></a>

**XMLFind** starts the search from the current position in the XML document. To search in the entire document, it is recommended to use [XMLRoot](../WDLang5/3081019.md) before using **XMLFind**.

**XMLFind** affects the current search. [XMLNext](../WDLang5/3081030.md) and [XMLPrevious](../WDLang5/3081023.md) will be positioned on the next and previous elements corresponding to the search. If the search fails (no element found), the current position before the beginning of the search is kept.

To cancel the search, use [XMLCancelSearch](../WDLang5/3081001.md). Furthermore, [XMLFirst](../WDLang5/3081024.md), [XMLLast](../WDLang5/3081013.md), [XMLRoot](../WDLang5/3081019.md), [XMLParent](../WDLang5/3081022.md) and [XMLChild](../WDLang5/3081012.md) cancel the current search.
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### XML functions and threads
<a name="xml_functions_and_threads_ELTPARAGRAPHE000338"></a>

If your application uses threads, the XML document is shared between all these threads. For more details on threads, see [Managing threads](../WDLang1/3077026.md).

If the current position in an XML document is modified in a thread, the current position in this XML document is modified for all the threads.
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Deleting an element during a search
<a name="deleting_element_during_search_ELTPARAGRAPHE000200"></a>

[XMLDelete](../WDLang5/3081036.md) used during a search cancels the search. 

Example to avoid (this code does not operate):


```wl
// Positions at the root of document
XMLRoot(:m_sDocName)
// Finds all the "txsr" from the root in order to delete them
XMLFind(:m_sDocName, CParagraph::CST_TAG, XMLTag + XMLChildItem + XMLContinue, XMLExact)
WHILE XMLFound(:m_sDocName) = True
	XMLDelete(:m_sDocName)
	// Next element in the search
	XMLNext(:m_sDocName)
END
XMLCancelSearch(:m_sDocName)
```
The following code must be used:


```wl
// Deletion during a search
// Positions at the root of document 
XMLRoot(:m_sDocName)
LOOP
	// Finds all the "txsr" from the root in order to delete them 
	XMLFind(:m_sDocName, CParagraph::CST_TAG , ...
					  XMLTag + XMLChildItem + XMLContinue, XMLExact)
	IF XMLFound(:m_sDocName) = True THEN
		XMLDelete (:m_sDocName)
	ELSE
		BREAK
	END
END
```
