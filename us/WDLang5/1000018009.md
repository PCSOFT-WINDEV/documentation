The **gglConnection** type is used to describe a connection to the Google services and to manage the authentication to different services. The characteristics of this connection can be defined and changed using different WLanguage properties.

**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

## Example


```wl
// Connection
Cnt is gglConnection
Cnt.Email = "email_final_user@gmail.com"
Cnt.ClientID = "387756281032-qffa6dajjd5348iqhi558dkd98xxxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com" 
Cnt.ClientSecret = "S13DCA6KkYh1EgPv9-jLxxxh" 
IF GglConnect(Cnt) = False THEN
	Error(ErrorInfo())
END
```

### Properties specific to gglConnection variables
<a name="properties_specific_gglconnection_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000032"></a>

The following properties can be used to handle a Google connection:

| Name | Type used | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ClientID | Character string | Client identifier given when declaring the application in the Google console. |
| ClientSecret | Character string | Secret code of the client given when declaring the application in the Google console. |
| Email | Character string | Email of final client. This property is optional. This property is used to pre-fill the login window of the client to his Google account. <br><br>Caution: This property cannot be used to retrieve the email account of the authenticated account. |

### Prerequisites for OAuth 2.0 authentication 
<a name="prerequisites_for_oauth_20_authentication_ELTPARAGRAPHE000196"></a>

To connect with the OAuth 2.0 authentication, the application must be declared on your Google developer console: [https://developers.google.com/console](https://developers.google.com/console). 
In the console: 

1. Click "Create a project". Give the name of your project. An identifier is automatically proposed for your project. 

2. Validate

3. The project is created. 

4. In the menu on the left, click "API and authentication" then "API". 

5. Choose the services required by the application: 

	- To access the calendars, choose "Calendar API" ("Google Apps APIs" category). 

	- To access the contacts, choose "Contacts API" ("Google Apps APIs" category). 

	- To access the Google documents, choose "Drive API" ("Google Apps APIs" category). 

	- To access the Picasa albums and the documents, there is no need to select a specific API. 




6. In the menu on the left, click "Identifiers". 

7. Then, click the "Create a client identifier" button. 

	- Select the type of application: "Application installed".

	- The authorization screen must be configured during the first creation of client identifier.   

	- In the authorisation screen, in the "Product name" area, enter the name of your application for example. 

	- Click "Save". 

	- The screen for creating the client identifier is re-displayed. 

		- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) For WINDEV applications, select "Installed application", then "Other".




- Validate. The client identifiers are created: 

	- Client identifier. This identifier must be stored. It will be used in the [gglConnection](../WDLang5/1000018009.md) variable. 

	- Secret code of client. This identifier must be stored. It will be used in the [gglConnection](../WDLang5/1000018009.md) variable. 

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Redirection URI. Check whether "http://localhost" is specified.

### Connection persistence
<a name="connection_persistence_ELTPARAGRAPHE000275"></a>

When connecting to the Google services, the authentication tokens are not saved. It is therefore necessary to log in again and allow access to the application each time it is run (i.e. each time a "blank" [gglConnection](../WDLang5/1000018009.md) variable is used). 

In order for the access authorization to be persistent, all you have to do is call the serialization functions of WLanguage. 

Example for implementing the persistence by using an XML file: 

```wl
let sAuthPersistenceFile = SysDir(srLocalAppData) + [fSep] + "gglauth.xml"

cnt is gglConnection
// If connection already established
IF fFileExist(sAuthPersistenceFile) THEN 
	// Restore the connection 
	let bufDeserialize = fLoadBuffer(sAuthPersistenceFile) 
	Deserialize(cnt, bufDeserialize, psdXML) 
ELSE 
	// New connection 
	cnt.Email = "email@gmail.com" 
	cnt.ClientID = "387756281032-qffa6dajjd5348iqhi558xxxxxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com" 
	cnt.ClientSecret = "Sxxxxx-jLMwwh" 
END 

IF GglConnect(cnt, gglCalendarService) THEN 
	// Save the connection in order to re-use it later 
	bufSerialize is Buffer 
	Serialize(cnt, bufSerialize, psdXML) 
	fSaveBuffer(sAuthPersistenceFile, bufSerialize) 
END
```

Remark: The authentication tokens of a **gglConnection** variable can be cleared via [GglDisconnect](../WDLang5/1000021451.md).
