## Remarks
**ConnectionCount** allows you to easily perform or get the following:

- license validity tests, for sites limited to a given number of connections, or charged according to the number of connections.

- statistics to determine the maximum number of people connected to a site, for example.


Each connection can be identified from the process identifier returned by [ExeGetPID](../WDLang1/1000017239.md).
