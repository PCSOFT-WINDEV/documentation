## Remarks


### Operating mode of the file upload performed via the Upload control
<a name="operating_mode_the_file_upload_performed_via_the_upload_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000070"></a>

Several events are associated with the Upload control (single or multi-file): 

- For a single-file Upload control, these events are associated with the "Send" button. 

- For a multi-file Upload control, these events are associated with the "Add" button. 




The events used when uploading the selected files are: 

- Browser event **"Progress of transfer"**: 
	This event is called regularly during the upload to update a progress bar, if available.

- Server event **"Receiving the uploaded files"**: 
	This event is run when all the files are received by the server. 
	**Remark**: If **UploadStart** is called with additional parameters, these parameters are transmitted to the event "Receiving the uploaded files". To retrieve these parameters, a procedure must be declared in this event (via the PROCEDURE statement).

### Limits
<a name="limits_ELTPARAGRAPHE000095"></a>

Modifications performed in the server event "Receiving the uploaded files" are NOT carried over to the browser. These modifications will be visible during the next display of the page.

### Maximum size of files to upload
<a name="maximum_size_files_upload_ELTPARAGRAPHE000240"></a>

**By default,** the size of files to upload is not limited in the WEBDEV engine. This size can be limited by the WEBDEV Application Server. 
The file will not be uploaded if its size exceeds the limit size.
To modify the maximum size of files to upload in WEBDEV application server, the registry must be modified on the server:  

1. To modify the size of the uploaded files for all the WEBDEV 28 applications, select the following key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\PC SOFT\\WEBDEV\\28.0 on a 32-bit computer and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\PC SOFT\\WEBDEV\\28.0 on a 64-bit computer.

2. Add the MAX_UPLOAD string. The value of this string will be the maximum size of files to upload (in KB).
