## Remarks


### Local storage persistent or not
<a name="local_storage_persistent_not_ELTPARAGRAPHE000043"></a>

During a persistent local storage, the stored values can be shared by all the windows and tabs of the same browser on a computer: therefore, they can be retrieved once the browser was closed then reopened or in another window of the browser. 

During a non-persistent local storage, the stored values are specific to a window (or to a tab) of the browser. in this case, the values will be lost when the browser window (or tab) is closed. On the contrary, these values can be read by the browser windows opened from the window where the values have been stored.
