## Example


```wl
// Swap the current row and row 5
LooperMoveLine(LOOP_Looper1, rowSelected, 5, amSwap)
// Move the current row to row 3
LooperMoveLine(LOOP_Looper1, rowSelected, 3, amMove)
// Swap the current row with the next row
LooperMoveLine(LOOP_Looper1, rowSelected, ...
	amNext, amSwap)
```

## Syntax

### Moving to a specific position

`<Result> = LooperMoveLine(<Looper control> , <Index of row to move> , <Destination row index> [, <Operation to perform>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**

New index of the row that was moved.

**`<Looper control>: (Control name)`**

Name of the Looper control to be used.
If this parameter corresponds to an empty string (""), the Looper control to which the current process belongs will be used.

**`<Index of row to move>: (Integer)`**

Position of the row to move. This position must be included between 1 and the number of rows found in the control (returned by [LooperCount](../WDLang2/3083014.md) or [Count](../Proprietes/2510097.md) for example).

To move the row that is currently selected, use the *rowSelected* constant.

**`<Destination row index>: (Integer)`**

New row position. This position must be included between 1 and the number of rows found in the control (returned by [LooperCount](../WDLang2/3083014.md) or [Count](../Proprietes/2510097.md) for example). A fatal error occurs if this parameter is not valid.

To handle the row currently selected, use the *rowSelected* constant.

**`<Operation to perform>: (Optional Integer constant (or combination of constants))`**

Change of position that will be performed for the row:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *amDisplayDestination* | The modified row is displayed in the Looper control. If necessary, an automatic scroll of rows is performed to display the modified row. The selected row (selection bar) is not modified.<br>This constant can be combined with the *amMove* and *amSwap* constants. |
| *amMove*<br>(default value) | The row is moved to the index of the destination row. |
| *amSwap* | The source row and the destination row are swapped. |

### Moving relatively to the current position

`<Result> = LooperMoveLine(<Looper control> , <Index of row to move> , <Relative move> [, <Operation to perform>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**

New index of the row that was moved.

**`<Looper control>: (Control name)`**

Name of the Looper control to be used.
If this parameter corresponds to an empty string (""), the Looper control to which the current process belongs will be used.

**`<Index of row to move>: (Integer)`**

Position of the row to move. This position must be included between 1 and the number of rows found in the control (returned by [LooperCount](../WDLang2/3083014.md) or [Count](../Proprietes/2510097.md) for example).

To move the row that is currently selected, use the *rowSelected* constant.

**`<Relative move>: (Integer constant)`**

Used to move or a swap to a position relative to the index of the row to move.


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *amFirst* | Moves the row to first position. |
| *amLast* | Moves the row to last position. |
| *amNext* | Moves the row one position to the bottom. |
| *amNextPage* | Moves the row one page to the bottom (a page corresponds to the number of rows that can be simultaneously displayed in the Looper control). |
| *amPrevious* | Moves the row one position upwards. |
| *amPreviousPage* | Moves the row one page to the top (a page corresponds to the number of rows that can be simultaneously displayed in the Looper control). |


If this parameter is invalid (*amPrevious* used on the first row of the Looper control for example), the row is moved "to the nearest" position.

**`<Operation to perform>: (Optional Integer constant (or combination of constants))`**

Change of position that will be performed for the row:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *amDisplayDestination* | The modified row is displayed. If necessary, an automatic scroll of rows is performed to display the modified row. The selected row (selection bar) is not modified.<br>This constant can be combined with the *amMove* and *amSwap* constants. |
| *amMove*<br>(default value) | The row is moved to the index of the destination row. |
| *amSwap* | The source row and the destination row are swapped. |

## Remarks


### Use conditions
<a name="use_conditions_ELTPARAGRAPHE000229"></a>

**LooperMoveLine** can be used on: 

- a Looper control with in-memory data source,

- a Looper control populated programmatically.

### Multi-selection Looper
<a name="multiselection_looper_ELTPARAGRAPHE000252"></a>

If **LooperMoveLine** is used on a multi-selection Looper control:

- when moving a row (*amMove* constant): all selected rows will be moved.

- when swapping rows (*amSwap* constant): only the first row will be swapped.

- the *rowSelected* constant cannot be used. Otherwise, a fatal error occurs and no row will be moved.

### Handling errors
<a name="handling_errors_ELTPARAGRAPHE000267"></a>

**Caution**: **LooperMoveLine** returns no error code. To determine if this function has generated an error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) with the *errMessage* constant.
