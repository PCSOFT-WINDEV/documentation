## Remarks


### Additional controls
<a name="additional_controls_ELTPARAGRAPHE000120"></a>

The page can contain additional controls specific to WEBDEV (WD_ACTION, WD_BUTTON_CLICK, ...). These controls are required by WEBDEV in order to operate properly. The value of these controls is also sent to the PHP server.
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Outgoing format and page optimization
<a name="outgoing_format_and_page_optimization_ELTPARAGRAPHE000127"></a>

The values are returned by pairs in the following format: (&lt;Control alias&gt;, &lt;Control value>).

We recommend that you use "Compress the names of controls (..Alias)".

**Reminder**: This option is available in the characteristics for advanced optimization of the HTML code:

- Configuration of projects: "Project" tab of the project description

- Configuration of a page: "Advanced" tab of the page description

### Caution: a single action can be performed at a time on the same page
<a name="caution_single_action_can_performed_time_the_same_page_ELTPARAGRAPHE000141"></a>

**PageToPHP** triggers an action on the page displayed in the browser of Web user. However, Internet browsers allow one single action on the page per process.

**Consequences**: **PageToPHP** cannot be used in a code triggering an action (automatically or not). This function is ignored:

- In the click code of a "submit" button (or in a procedure called by the click code of this button)

- In the click code of an "other" button whose action differs from "none" (or in a procedure called by the click code of this button)

- If it is followed by [PageSubmit](../WDLang2/3058020.md) or by [EmailOpenMail](../WDLang2/3032021.md) (in the current process, in a procedure called by the current process or in another process called by [Execute](../WDLang1/3013041.md)).
