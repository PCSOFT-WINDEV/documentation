## Syntax

`PageToJSP(<Page> , <Target URL> , <Send method> [, <Destination> [, <Window name> [, <Options> [, <Width> [, <Height> [, <Horizontal position> [, <Vertical position> [, <JavaScript parameters>]]]]]]]])`
---

**`<Page>: (Page name)`**

Name of the page whose data must be sent to the JSP server. 
If this parameter corresponds an empty string (""), the current page will be taken into account. This page must be currently displayed in the browser.

**`<Target URL>: (Character string)`**

URL of the JSP page to which the data found in the WEBDEV page must be sent.

**`<Send method>: (Character String constant)`**

Method for sending the data to the JSP server:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *GET* | The data is sent to the server via the URL. |
| *POST* | The data is sent after the HTTP headers, in the body of the request. |



**`<Destination>: (Optional character string or constant)`**

Name of target frame. &lt;Destination&gt; can also take the following values:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *CurrentBrowser* | the target is the current browser. |
| *CurrentFrame* | the target is the current frame (default value). |
| *NewBrowser* | the target is a new browser (a new browser window is opened). The following parameters of **PageToJSP** are used to configure this new window. |
| *ParentFrame* | the target is the container of the current page (parent frameset, parent browser). |



**`<Window name>: (Optional character string)`**

Window name in the new browser if &lt;Target&gt; is set to the *NewBrowser* constant. This parameter allows you to redisplay a page in a browser with the same name (if several browsers are open on the computer of the Web user).

**`<Options>: (Optional Integer constant (or combination of constants))`**

Parameters of the window in the new browser if &lt;Destination&gt; is equal to the *NewBrowser* constant:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *ONFull* <br>(Default value) | The window of the new browser will include an address bar and scrollbars (equivalent to the combination of all the previous constants). |
| *ONLink* | The link bar will be displayed. |
| *ONLocation* | The address bar will be displayed. |
| *ONMenuBar* | The menu bar will be displayed. |
| *ONResizable* | The window of the new browser will be resizable. |
| *ONSatusBar* | The status bar will be displayed. |
| *ONScrollbar* | The scrollbars will be displayed. |
| *ONSimple* | The window of the new browser will be a simple window (no combination of constants). |
| *ONToolbar* | The toolbar will be displayed. |



**`<Width>: (Optional integer)`**

Width of window in the new browser (in pixels).

**`<Height>: (Optional integer)`**

Height of window in the new browser (in pixels).

**`<Horizontal position>: (Optional integer)`**

Horizontal position (in pixels) of the window in the new browser (in relation to the upper-left corner of the screen).

**`<Vertical position>: (Optional integer)`**

Vertical position (in pixels) of the window in the new browser (in relation to the upper-left corner of the screen).

**`<JavaScript parameters>: (Optional character string)`**

Other JavaScript parameters that must be used when opening a new browser if &lt;Target&gt; is equal to the *NewBrowser* constant.

## Remarks


### Additional controls
<a name="additional_controls_ELTPARAGRAPHE000119"></a>

The page can contain additional controls specific to WEBDEV (WD_ACTION, WD_BUTTON_CLICK, ...). These controls are required by WEBDEV in order to operate properly. The value of these controls is also sent to the JSP server.
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Outgoing format and page optimization
<a name="outgoing_format_and_page_optimization_ELTPARAGRAPHE000126"></a>

The values are returned by pairs in the following format: (&lt;Control alias&gt;, &lt;Control value>).

We recommend that you use "Compress the names of controls (..Alias)".

**Reminder**: This option is available in the characteristics for advanced optimization of the HTML code:

- Configuration of projects: "Project" tab of the project description

- Configuration of a page: "Advanced" tab of the page description

### Caution: a single action can be performed at a time on the same page
<a name="caution_single_action_can_performed_time_the_same_page_ELTPARAGRAPHE000140"></a>

**PageToJSP** triggers an action on the page displayed in the browser of Web user. However, Internet browsers allow one single action on the page per process.

**Consequences**: **PageToJSP** cannot be used in a code triggering an action (automatically or not). This function is ignored:

- In the click code of a "submit" button (or in a procedure called by the click code of this button)

- In the click code of an "other" button whose action differs from "none" (or in a procedure called by the click code of this button)

- If it is followed by [PageSubmit](../WDLang2/3058020.md) or by [EmailOpenMail](../WDLang2/3032021.md) (in the current process, in a procedure called by the current process or in another process called by [Execute](../WDLang1/3013041.md)).
