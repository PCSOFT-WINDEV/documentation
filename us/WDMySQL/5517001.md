## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000238"></a>
WINDEV and WEBDEV 28 propose a Native MySQL Connector (or Native MySQL Access). This Native Connector allows you to access a MySQL database from a WLanguage program without using any external driver.

**Caution**: This version of the Native MySQL Connector works with WINDEV and WEBDEV version 28. The Native MySQL Connector is not available for WINDEV Mobile. If you are using WINDEV Mobile, the access to a foreign database (MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server) must be performed via a [Webservice](../WDLang4/1000021063.md) provided with WINDEV Mobile. For more details, see the help about [SQLConnectWS](../WDLang4/1000021031.md). 

**Remark**: The Native MySQL Connector is an optional and free module available for download from [the PC SOFT site](https://www.windev.com)

### Conditions for using the Native MySQL Connector
<a name="conditions_for_using_the_native_mysql_connector_ELTPARAGRAPHE000036"></a>

- Client layer of MySQL (LibMySQL.DLL file)

	- 32-bit client layer to use the 32-bit Native MySQL Connector (version 3.x to 5.x tested).

	- 64-bit client layer to use the 64-bit Native MySQL Connector (version 5.x tested).




- The ***LibMySQL.DLL*** DLL must be found:

	- On the development computer: 

		- in the "\\Programs\\Framework\\Win32x86" directory of the setup directory of WINDEV or WEBDEV (32-bit).

		- in the "\\Programs\\Framework\\Win64x86" directory of the setup directory of WINDEV or WEBDEV (64-bit).




- On the deployment computer, in the executable directory or in the Windows directory. For a deployment on a Web server, the DLL must be found in the directory of the Native Connector or in the Windows directory.

### The necessary files
<a name="the_necessary_files_ELTPARAGRAPHE000057"></a>

The following files are required to use the Native MySQL Connector:

- The ***LibMySQL.DLL*** DLL. This DLL is distributed with MySQL. For more details, see the license agreement of MySQL about the distribution conditions of this DLL.

	- 32-bit file to use the 32-bit Native MySQL Connector.

	- 64-bit file to use the 64-bit Native MySQL Connector. 


From version 5.5 of libmysql.dll client, the computer that runs the application must install a **Visual Studio Redistributable** package corresponding to the server version (for more details, see the Oracle site).




- The ***wd280msql.dll*** DLL: Required for the 32-bit Native Connector to a MySQL database. This file is supplied with the Native MySQL Connector for WINDEV or WEBDEV.

- The ***wd280msql64.dll*** DLL: Required for the 64-bit Native Connector to a MySQL database. This file is supplied with the Native MySQL Connector for WINDEV or WEBDEV.




To debug a multi-configuration project in 32-bit and 64-bit configuration: 

- copy the 32-bit libmysql DLL into the EXE sub-folder of 32-bit configuration of project. 

- copy the 64-bit libmysql DLL into the EXE sub-folder of 64-bit configuration of project.

### Installing a new version of MySQL
<a name="installing_new_version_mysql_ELTPARAGRAPHE000090"></a>

The dialog between the Native MySQL Connector and MySQL uses the LIBMYSQL.DLL library provided with MySQL. 
The Native Connector may no longer operate if the behavior of this DLL is modified (when changing version for example).

An upgraded version that takes these changes into account will be available soon ; meanwhile, all you have to do is use the previous version of LIBMYSQL.DLL. This DLL will operate with the new version of MySQL, while still being compatible with the Native Connector.

### Files required to use Native MySQL Connector in Linux
<a name="files_required_use_native_mysql_connector_linux_ELTPARAGRAPHE000103"></a>

To use Native MySQL Connector in Linux, the following operations must be performed:

1. Install the MySQL client layer on the server. Check whether the ***libmysqlclient.so*** DLL was copied into /usr/lib.
	Remarks: 

	- The 32-bit MySQL client layer must be installed to use the 32-bit Native MySQL Connector. 

	- The 64-bit MySQL client layer must be installed to use the 64-bit Native MySQL Connector. 


 If the copied DLLs are such as libmysqlClient.so.12.0.0, a link must be created on this DLL with the following line of code:
	
	```txt
	ln -s libmysqlclient.so.12.0.0 libmysqlclient.so
	```


2. If you are using a WEBDEV site, copy the following DLLs to the directory of WEBDEV Application Server:

	- wd280hf.so: HFSQL library

	- wd280msql.so: library of 32-bit Native Connector

	- wd280msql64.so: library of 64-bit Native Connector

	- wd280sql.so: SQL library




3. If you are using a Java application or a Linux Batch, copy the following DLLs to the application directory:

	- wd280hf.so: HFSQL library

	- wd280msql.so: library of 32-bit Native Connector

	- wd280msql64.so: library of 64-bit Native Connector

	- wd280sql.so: SQL library

### Using the Native MySQL Connector in your WINDEV applications and WEBDEV sites
<a name="using_the_native_mysql_connector_your_windev_applications_and_webdev_sites_ELTPARAGRAPHE000156"></a>

To use MySQL in native mode, you must program in the WINDEV application or WEBDEV site:

- with the "SQL" functions of WLanguage (see [Programming with SQL functions](../WDMySQL/5517004.md)).

- with the "HFSQL" functions of WLanguage (see [Programming with HFSQL functions](../WDMySQL/5517003.md)).


**Remarks**: 

- Don't forget to read the [limitations of the Native MySQL Connector](../WDMySQL/5517002.md).

- The option "Automatically create the data files when they are opened" ("Files" tab in the project description) is taken into account by the Native MySQL Connector. 



<a name="NOTE4_2"></a>


### Optimizing HFSQL functions
<a name="optimizing_hfsql_functions_ELTPARAGRAPHE000188"></a>

- **The "Browsing table" controls based on queries are optimized**: the content of the Table control can be sorted by clicking one of its columns.

- To avoid re-running the same query several times when browsing its result, we advise you to use the ***hNoRefresh*** constant (if the data is modified by a single computer for example).
