## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000125"></a>
The SQL functions can be used to handle the MySQL database.

**Differences compared to HFSQL programming**: The use of SQL functions to handle MySQL data does not require importing the file structure into the analysis. However, the data must be handled by queries only. The content of MySQL files cannot be read directly.

## Programming

### 1. Establishing the connection
<a name="1_establishing_the_connection_ELTPARAGRAPHE000022"></a>

[SQLConnect](../WDLang4/3072005.md) opens a connection to a MySQL database via the Native Connector. The type of database used (MySQL in this case) must be passed as parameter to **SQLConnect**.

**Remark**: The name of the MySQL data source ("MySQLDatabase" in this case) is the name or the IP address of the computer where the database is available. In any case, the name of the "Database" must be specified.


```wl
ConnectionNum = SQLConnect("MySQLDatabase", "", "", "", "MySQL")
// or ConnectionNum = SQLConnect("MySQLDatabase", "User", "Password", "MyDatabase", "MySQL")
 
// Connection to a remote MySQL database
ConnectionNum = SQLConnect("192.168.1.51", "User", "Password", "test", "MySQL")
```

### 2. Running queries
<a name="2_running_queries_ELTPARAGRAPHE000035"></a>

The queries are run by [SQLExec](../WDLang4/3072007.md). **SQLExec** expects the text of the SQL query as parameter, as well as the name that will be given to this query.


```wl
SQLExec("SELECT LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME, EXTENSION, PHOTO FROM CUSTOMER", "QRY1")
```

### 3. Retrieving the result
<a name="3_retrieving_the_result_ELTPARAGRAPHE000047"></a>

Several methods can be used to retrieve the result:

- [SQLFirst](../WDLang4/3072017.md): Retrieves and iterates over the result with [SQLFirst/SQLCol](../WDLang4/3072025.md).

- [SQLTable](../WDLang4/3072031.md): Retrieves the result of the query in a Table control populated programmatically in the WINDEV application or WEBDEV site. The result of the query can be retrieved by partial Fetch.

- [SQLFetch](../WDLang4/3072011.md): Used to read the different lines of the query result. The iteration over the query result is performed with [SQLFetch/SQLGetCol](../WDLang4/3072025.md).




[SQLLock](../WDLang4/3072003.md) is used to lock the table records or the records selected by the query. The timeout to lock or modify a locked record is set to 50s by default on MySQL. The database will return an error when the timeout is reached.
<a name="NOTE2_4"></a>


### 4. Closing the connection
<a name="4_closing_the_connection_ELTPARAGRAPHE000074"></a>

[SQLClose](../WDLang4/3072015.md) is used to close the connection to the database once all the necessary queries have been run.
