| [HAddGroup](../WDLang4/3044280.md) | Adds a group of users (HFSQL Client/Server connection) |
| [HAddLink](../WDLang4/3044312.md) | Adds an integrity rule between two files on the server. |
| [HAddUser](../WDLang4/3044281.md) | Adds a user (HFSQL Client/Server connection) |
| [HChangeLogDir](../WDLang4/3044164.md) | Modifies the location of the log files corresponding to an HFSQL file. (\*JNL file as well as JournalOpération and JournalIdentification files if they exist). |
| [HCopyFile](../WDLang4/3044282.md) | Copies an HFSQL file from the client to the server (and conversely) |
| [HCreation](../WDLang4/3044255.md) | Creates an empty data file (.FIC extension) with the index file and the memo file if necessary. |
| [HCreationIfNotFound](../WDLang4/3044254.md) | The following operations are performed by **HCreationIfNotFound**:<br><br>- If the file does not exist, creates an empty data file (".FIC" file) with the index file and the memo file if necessary. <br>	The function is equivalent to [HCreation](../WDLang4/3044255.md).<br><br>- If the file exists, opens the file. <br>	In this case, the function is equivalent to [HOpen](../WDLang4/3044120.md).  <br>	To optimize the call to **HCreationIfNotFound**, the file opening can also be performed during the first access to the file.<br><br><br> |
