An internal component is a set of elements from a project. This set is used to:

- Organize a project: you can create internal components to group the elements of a project, by functionality, for example.

- Share elements between multiple projects, via the SCM.

The elements of an internal component can be private or public:

- Private elements can be handled by the other elements of the component.

- Public elements can be handled by the elements of the project that uses the internal component.
