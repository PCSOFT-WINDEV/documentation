The development of a mobile **Application** (Android, iOS, etc.) with WINDEV Mobile is based on two main elements: the Project and the Analysis.

A **WINDEV Mobile project** is a set of elements (windows, controls, classes, components, etc.) which put together, make it possible to create an application.

A **WINDEV Mobile Analysis** is a diagram of the data used by the application. The analysis contains the different data files (tables) used by the application.

An application is built from a project.

In most cases, a project is associated with an analysis.

An analysis can be associated with one or more projects.![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P9-Projet-et-Analyse.png)
