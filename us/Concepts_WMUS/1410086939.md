FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a protocol for transferring files from one site to another. This protocol is used to transfer files via TCP/IP, the Internet, Wi-Fi or ActiveSync.

On the Internet, thousands of file servers can be accessed via FTP. These servers host shareware or freeware software accessible to the public.

Several WLanguage functions allow you to manage files on an FTP server from your WINDEV Mobile applications.
