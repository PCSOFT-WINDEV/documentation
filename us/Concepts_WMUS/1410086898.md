WINDEV Mobile allows you to create window templates. These templates contain all the graphic elements common to all the windows of your application.
Changes made to a window template are automatically applied to all the windows that use the template.

Window templates allow you to keep the style book defined for an application.

Template used in multiple windows.
Elements from the template are identified by a yellow square.


A window template can be created:

- via the ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P1_ICO_Cr%E9er_cpt.gif)
 icon in the quick access buttons. In the "New" window, click "Window", and then "Window template".

- from the current window (on the "Home" tab, in the "General" group, expand "Save" and select "Save as a template").




To create a window based on a template, select the desired template when creating the window.

The characteristics of the elements can be dissociated from the template. For example, dissociate the position of a control from the template to move it elsewhere while keeping other changes (code, style, etc.). This is referred to as **control inheritance**. In this case, the elements are identified by a blue square.
