## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000268"></a>
An internal component is a set of elements from a project. This set is used to:

- organize a project,

- share elements between different projects (mainly via the Source Code Manager).




When an internal component is integrated into a project, all its elements are also integrated. Public elements can be handled directly in the editor. In addition, the internal component can be debugged directly from the project that uses it.

In WEBDEV, projects that use internal components can access the names of the objects, procedures or methods defined as visible by the author of the component.

Creating a component is **very simple**.

Simply create your pages, procedures and classes. When you're done, choose the option available in the editor to create an internal component.

An internal component can contain code, pages, an analysis, data files, etc.

## Step by step

### Step 1: Creating an internal component
<a name="step_1_creating_internal_component_ELTPARAGRAPHE000045"></a>

We will create an internal component to subscribe and unsubscribe from a newsletter.

This component includes:

- a page to see the newsletter subscribers,

- a web control template that contains the different controls (email address, validation button, etc.),

- an analysis with the description of the subscriber data file.


To avoid writing the code of the component, all the necessary elements have been included in a project named "WW_Internal_Component". We will use this project to create our internal component. Then, we will use the internal component in the "Full WEBDEV Site" project. 



- To open the example project:

	1. Start WEBDEV 28. 

	2. Go to the WEBDEV home page if necessary (Ctrl + &lt;). 

	3. On the home page, click "Tutorial", then in "Part 9 - Lesson 9.1 - Internal components", double-click "Internal component - Exercise".

	4. The project is loaded.

### Step 2: Using the internal component
<a name="step_2_using_the_internal_component_ELTPARAGRAPHE000124"></a>Once created, your internal component can be used in any other WEBDEV project.
Let's see how to reuse the component.|   |   |   |

| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png)<br> | Note | In this example, we will see how to use the internal component directly. To share resources, it is recommended to use the internal components via the Source Code Manager (SCM).<br><br>For more details, see [Internal component](../Editeurs/2014100.md). |



In our example, we will import the internal component into the "Full WEBDEV Site" project. 



- Open the "Full_WEBDEV_Site" project.

	1. Go to the WEBDEV home page (Ctrl + &lt;).

	2. On the home page, click "Tutorial", then in "Part 9 - Lesson 9.1 - Internal components", double-click "Full WEBDEV Site - Exercise". 

	3. WEBDEV opens a dialog box to inform you that the project has already been opened and prompts you to open the local version or overwrite the project with the original version. To retrieve your changes, click "Open the local copy".

| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=exemple-WB.png)<br> | Answers | A completed project is available. You can use this project to complete the different exercises of this lesson. To open the completed project, go to the home page and click "Tutorial", then in "Part 9 - Lesson 9.1 - Internal components", double-click "Full WEBDEV Site - Answers". |












- Import the internal component into the project.

	1. In the ribbon, on the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, expand "Import" and select "An Internal component .. From a file".

	2. Select the following file: "My Projects\\My Examples\\WW_Internal_Components (Exercises)\\InternalComponentNewsletterSubscription\\InternalComponentNewsletterSubscription.wci". This file corresponds to the previously created component. 

	3. The internal component is imported into the project.







- To use the internal component, we will add the web control template of the internal component to the home page of the website. To do so:

	1. Open the "PAGE_List_of_new_products" page in the editor (double-click its name in the "Project explorer" pane).

	2. Move the looper down to insert the control template of the internal component. 

	3. In the ribbon, on the "Creation" tab, in the "Containers" group, click "Control template".

	4. The window that shows the control templates of the project appears.  ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P9_Composant%20Interne%20-%20HC%20N%B0009.jpg)


	5. Select the template from the internal component and validate.

6. Click where you want to add the control template.

- We will test the control template:

	1. Test the page (click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_Go_Page_WB_GAF.jpg)
 in the quick access buttons).

	2. Type an email address.

	3. Click "VALIDATE".

	4. A message confirms the subscription.
