## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000382"></a>
A site can be used by different contributors with different profiles. It is sometimes necessary to define different access levels according to the user (customer, salesman, manager, etc.).

Let's take a simple example: an e-commerce website that allows users to do the following:

- View prices,

- Modify prices,

- Enter orders,

- Manage customers.


Accesses are different according to the user. For example:

- customers can see the price list and place orders.

- salesmen can see the price list, place orders and create new customers.

- managers have access to all the options.




WEBDEV allows you to manage these different access levels via the User Groupware.

We will enable the User Groupware in our "Full_WEBDEV_Site" site and configure it to limit the access to the page for adding products.



- Open the project you worked on in the previous lesson. 

	1. Go to the WEBDEV home page (Ctrl + &lt;).

	2. On the home page, click "Tutorial", then in "Parts 3 to 6", double-click "Full WEBDEV Site - Exercise".

	3. A dialogue box prompts you to open the project you worked on in the previous lesson. You can open the local copy or the original project. Select "Open the local copy".

## Integrating the User Groupware
<a name="integrating_the_user_groupware_ELTTEXTE000424"></a>


- To enable the User Groupware in the "Full_WEBDEV_Site" project:

	1. On the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, click "User Groupware". The configuration window of the current platform opens on the "GPU / Private Store" tab.
			|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png)<br> | Note | The User Groupware can be set up for only one of your project configurations. When testing the project, the User Groupware connection window will only be displayed when testing the platform for which the groupware has been enabled. |





	2. In "User Groupware", click "Change". 

	3. The User Groupware configuration window is displayed. Enable the User Groupware by clicking "Enabled". 

	4. Select "Standard User Groupware" and "Manual start via a control template".  
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P5_Groupware%20Utilisateur%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.jpg&type=thumb)

			|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png)<br> | Note | **When the User Groupware is in "Automatic start" mode**, a standard log in page appears. If users enter their usernames and passwords, they are allowed to access the site.<br><br>**When the User Groupware is in "Manual start via a control template" mode**, the developer can use a specific control template. This control template can be used to insert a link into the page to allow users to log in. We will present this solution in this lesson since it is easy to use and adapt. |





	5. Validate. A message is displayed, indicating that an administrator account is created by default.
			|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png)<br> | Note | The supervisor is the default user. The first time you log in to the site, enter: "supervisor" as username and password. |





	6. Validate this message. 

	7. Validate the project configuration window. The User Groupware has been enabled in the project.
			|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png)<br> | Note | In this example, we will keep all the default options. Several options can also be configured. <br>For more details, see [User Groupware: Options and settings](../Editeurs/1000021153.md). |

## Configuring the User Groupware
<a name="configuring_the_user_groupware_ELTTEXTE000520"></a>
The User Groupware is configured when running the site. This configuration consists in defining the different users as well as their rights on the site pages and controls.|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png)<br> | Note | The users can be configured:<br><br>- when developing the application. The necessary data files (regarding the users and their rights) can be installed with the site.<br><br>- when the administrator installs the site.<br><br><br> |




<a name="NOTE4_2"></a>


### Including the customer section in the site
<a name="including_the_customer_section_the_site_ELTPARAGRAPHE000122"></a>

In this example, we will add the log in link to "PAGE_List_of_products".

The log in link is provided as a control template.|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png)<br> | Note | A control template is a specific page containing several controls. This page can contain all types of controls. Control templates use the "WDT" file extension.<br><br>The main advantage of using a control template is that it can be easily reused. A control template can be reused in any page of the project. You only need to make changes once and WEBDEV automatically applies them on all the pages that use the control template.<br><br>Control templates can be overridden: code can be added, the controls can be moved in the page that uses the control template. Controls can also be modified. |







- To add the log in link:

	1. Open the "PAGE_List_of_products" page in the editor.

	2. Go to the "Project explorer" pane, "Internal components", and expand "WDGPU_WB_CNT". This internal component was included in the project when enabling the Groupware. It contains all the necessary elements, especially the control template used to log in.

	3. Then, expand "WEBDEV control templates".

<a name="NOTE4_4"></a>


### Creating users and groups
<a name="creating_users_and_groups_ELTPARAGRAPHE000171"></a>

To configure the User Groupware, we are going to create a "Product Management" group. This group will include the users who are allowed to modify and add products in the site.

Then, we will create a user named Alison and associate it with the "Product Management" group.



- To create a new group of users:

	1. Click the "Groups" tab. 

	2. Click "Add a group". The screen for entering a new group is displayed.

	3. Type the group name: "Product Management".

### Defining rights
<a name="defining_rights_ELTPARAGRAPHE000220"></a>

We will now define the access rights to the menu for adding a product.

**It is recommended to refuse default access and allow selected groups only**.

- We will define the rights for users who haven't logged in (i.e., not identified by the Groupware). These rights will be used by default when starting the site, as long as the user isn't logged in.




- Define the rights:

	1. To prevent all users from accessing the page used to add products, select the "Visitor (not connected)" user. Any user who is not logged in is automatically associated with this user.
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P5_Groupware%20Utilisateur%20-%20HC%20N%B0006.jpg&type=thumb)


	2. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P5_Groupware%20Utilisateur%20-%20HC%20N%B0006%201.jpg)
 to set the rights.

3. The page that appears allows you to select each page, page template or report of the application.
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P5_Groupware%20Utilisateur%20-%20HC%20N%B0007.jpg&type=thumb)




- In our case, the "Add a product" link is in the "PAGETPL_Menu" page template:

	1. Select the "PAGETPL_Menu" page template from the list. The rights defined on the page template will be applied to all the pages that use the template.

	2. The names of the different page controls appear on the right.

	3. For "Menu option Option_2", select "Grayed" in the "State" combo box.
