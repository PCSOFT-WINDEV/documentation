## Introduction
<a name="introduction_ELTTEXTE000195"></a>
The development of a large IS system requires the participation of multiple developers. Sometimes, developers must work on a single WEBDEV project and share different resources (pages, classes...).

WEBDEV includes a Source Code Manager (SCM) that allows developers to share the source code of different projects and find the full history of changes made to the code, interface, etc.

## SCM (Source Code Manager)

### How the SCM works
<a name="how_the_scm_works_ELTPARAGRAPHE000036"></a>

The Source Code Manager is used to store and share projects and their elements.

The principle is as follows:

- A reference version of each of your projects is stored on a server. This set of versions is called "Repository".

- Each developer has a local copy of the different projects. ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=GestionnaireDeSources1.gif)


- When a developer wants to modify a project element (page, report, query, etc.), they notify the SCM that they temporary own this element. To do so, the developer will check out the element from the repository.

- This developer gets exclusive rights on this element: all the desired modifications can be performed on this element.

- The other developers continue to work on the copy of the reference version of the element (located in the repository).

- Once the developer has finished, the checked out element is checked back into the repository.

- The other developers are automatically notified of this check-in operation. They can now update their local copy. ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=GestionnaireDeSources_synch.gif)





The SCM supports teamwork and allows you to get the history of all the changes

It can also be used to manage and control elements shared between multiple projects.

For more details, see [Share your projects via Git](../Editeurs/9500230.md). <br>However, it is recommended to use the SCM. In addition to text comparison, the SCM allows for rich object comparison (control properties, for example). An SCM-specific interface allows you to easily merge and compare elements. |

### Creating the repository
<a name="creating_the_repository_ELTPARAGRAPHE000072"></a>

To share a project via the Source Code Manager, a repository must be created. This repository must be created once only on the server.

This repository can be created:

- when installing WEBDEV.

- when creating a project that uses the SCM.

- when importing a project into the SCM.

- whenever you want, from WEBDEV directly or from the SCM administrator.


The repository can be installed in the following modes:

- HFSQL Classic,

- HFSQL Client/Server,

- PCSCloud (paid turnkey solution). The PCSCloud mode allows you to access the sources of the projects from anywhere, at any time. This mode corresponds to a private Cloud (dedicated server) and offers numerous options (dedicated platform, Control Centers, etc.). For more details, see [PCSCloud](https://pcscloud.net/UK/cloud_development.awp).

- SCMDrive (paid turnkey solution). The SCMDrive mode allows you to access the sources of the projects from anywhere, at any time. This solution uses a shared server. For more details, see [SCMDrive](https://pcscloud-drive.net/UK/SCMDrive/index.awp).






- In the next lesson, our repository will be created when importing a project into the SCM.

To do so, simply: <br><br>- connect to the SCM management tool as administrator. <br><br>- on the "Management" tab, in the "Backups" group, select "Full backup".<br><br><br> |
