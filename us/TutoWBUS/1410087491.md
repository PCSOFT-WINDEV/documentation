## Overview of the site created in this part
<a name="overview_the_site_created_this_part_ELTTEXTE000208"></a>
In this part, we will use the project we created in part 3: we will create an Internet section in the Intranet site. The Internet section will be used to list the new products and see their details.

This section will be created in AWP mode (Active WEBDEV Page).|   |   |   |

Part 5 will allow you to continue the site development, by exploring the following features: 

- Printing reports,

- Managing use levels,

- Sending emails,

- Managing multiple languages,

- ...


The development of this site will also allow us to cover the deployment phase in part 6.

If you followed part 3, you can use the same example in part 4.|   |   |   |

## Displaying a WEBDEV site in AWP mode
<a name="displaying_webdev_site_awp_mode_ELTTEXTE000268"></a>
The Internet section of our site will be developed in AWP mode. Unlike sites in session mode, the AWP mode allows for easy SEO.

Let's analyze how the AWP mode works.
<a name="NOTE3_2"></a>


### What is an Active WEBDEV Page?
<a name="what_active_webdev_page_ELTPARAGRAPHE000069"></a>

An Active WEBDEV Page is a page in WEBDEV session mode **without persistent context** on the server. The Active WEBDEV Page context is temporary. It is created in a temporary session.

**Reminder**: In a WEBDEV site in Session mode, each displayed page owns a persistent page context for the entire lifetime of the session on the server.

### Operating mode of AWP sites
<a name="operating_mode_awp_sites_ELTPARAGRAPHE000078"></a>

For each Active WEBDEV Page displayed in the browser, the following elements are automatically created on the server:

- a temporary session,

- a temporary Active WEBDEV Page context.




The **temporary session** contains the temporary context of the Active WEBDEV Page. When the Active WEBDEV Page is sent to the user, the temporary page context and the temporary session are deleted. Memory is cleared on the server-side. 

The **temporary context of the Active WEBDEV Page** contains all the elements required to build the page viewed by the user:

- local variables,

- server processes,

- database connections,

- file contexts, etc.




When the Active WEBDEV Page is sent to the user, these elements are removed.

### How to share information (values) between Active WEBDEV pages?
<a name="how_share_information_values_between_active_webdev_pages_ELTPARAGRAPHE000100"></a>

There are two methods to share values between Active WEBDEV Pages:

- Passing information in the URL. This method allows for better SEO.

- Saving information in AWP contexts (programmatically).




**Passing information (values) between two pages in the URL**

It is possible to pass information from one page to another via the URL. The URL has the following format: "http://Web server/.../mypage.awp?NameParam1=Value1&NameParam2=Value2".

This method allows a better page SEO because the information passed in the URL is visible and analyzed by the SEO robots.

**Saving information (values) in AWP contexts (programmatically)**

You can store values common to several Active WEBDEV Pages on the server, via **AWP contexts**. An AWP context is created on disk on the server. This context is available as long as Active WEBDEV Pages are displayed and as long as the timeout of the AWP contexts is not exceeded. The timeout of AWP contexts can be defined in the WEBDEV administrator ("Configuration" tab, "Duration of AWP contexts" option).

To manage AWP contexts, you must use WLanguage functions such as [DeclareAWPContext](../WDLang2/3058028.md), [FreeAWPContext](../WDLang2/1000020429.md), etc.

For more details, see [AWP: Managing contexts](../WDChamp/3539060.md).
