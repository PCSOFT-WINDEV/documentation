This application includes seven parts, represented by seven tabs:

- Connections: Displays the list of users connected to the sites and allows you to disconnect a user.

- Setups: Used to lock the server for maintenance, allow or forbid remote setups, and configure the setup log. This log lists the elements installed in a site. It is especially useful to contact our Technical Support if you encounter errors during deployment.

## Remote WEBDEV administrator
<a name="remote_webdev_administrator_ELTTEXTE000224"></a>
The remote administrator is a WEBDEV site that provides features similar to the WEBDEV administrator but that can be used to manage WEBDEV sites remotely.|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=avertissement.png)<br> | Caution! | If you use the remote administrator, security configuration is essential. It is recommended to access the administrator via an HTTPS connection and to set strong passwords. |



Remark: This tool is not available with "WEBDEV Application Server - 10 connections".

When you deploy your dynamic site to a hosting platform, you can use the remote administrator to update the parameters of your site (if the hosting provider allows remote administration).



- To start WDAdminWeb:

	1. Open a browser.

	2. Enter the following URL in the address bar (with the same case):
			
		```txt
		http://computer/WDAdminWeb
		```

			where "computer" is the name of the deployment server.

	3. Enter the username and password to log in to the remote WEBDEV administrator. 

	4. The administrator starts.
