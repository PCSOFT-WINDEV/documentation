The **TitleImage** property is used to get and/or change the image displayed next to the title of a column in a Table control. The image is positioned on the left of the column title (or on the right if the writing direction is reversed). 

This property is also available for the TreeView Table controls.

**Remark**: This property is used to easily include an image in a column title. [gImage](../WDLang1/3029042.md) is not required anymore.

## Remarks


### Image position
<a name="image_position_ELTPARAGRAPHE000051"></a>

The position of the image in the column title depends on the writing direction chosen for the application:

- If the writing direction goes from right to left, the image will be positioned to the right of the column title.

- If the writing direction goes from left to right, the image will be positioned to the left of the column title.




Reminder: The writing direction of an application can be defined by:

- the linguistic options of the project: on the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, click "Description". In the "Languages" tab, choose the "Various" linguistic options and configure the "Text direction" option.

- the [TextDirection](../Proprietes/2513020.md) property.
