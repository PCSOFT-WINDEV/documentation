The **ImageState** property is used to get and change the number of drawings in:

- The image associated with a button.

- The image of the cursor in a slider.

- The image associated with the button of a sidebar pane.

- The image associated with the button of a tab pane.

- The image associated with the Rating control.

- The image associated with a group in a Ribbon control.

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) The image associated with a menu option.




In Radio Buttons and Check Boxes, the **ImageState** property is used to get the number of animation steps. 

For the images in a format other than the animated GIF, the animation is defined via a drawing board. The animation steps correspond to the number of drawing lines in the image set.  

**Remark**: Each image drawing corresponds to a state:

- For Button controls, sidebar pane, tab pane, menu option, etc.: the drawings must follow a specific order: Normal, Pressed, Grayed, Focus and Rollover.

- For Slider controls: the drawings must follow this order: Normal and Pressed.
