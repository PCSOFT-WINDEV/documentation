The **Minute** property is used to:

- Retrieve the minutes from a [Time](../Motscles/1514068.md) or [DateTime](../Motscles/1514070.md) variable, or the number of minutes from a [Duration](../Motscles/1514069.md) variable.

- Change the minutes in a [Time](../Motscles/1514068.md) or [DateTime](../Motscles/1514070.md) variable, or the number of minutes in a [Duration](../Motscles/1514069.md) variable.

- Retrieve the minutes or the number of minutes from a Date item (in "Date and Time" or "Duration" format) or from a Time item. 
	

- Modify the minutes or the number of minutes in a Date item (in "Date and Time" or "Duration" format) or in a Time item. 
	




**Remark**: The **Minute** property is used to easily change times and durations (add one  hour, etc).

**Reminder**: Date items are used to manage:

- "Year - Month - Day" dates (YYYYMMDD format)

- "Year - Month - Day - Hours - Minutes - Seconds - Milliseconds" dates and times (YYYYMMDDHHmmSSCCC format)

- "Number of days - Number of hours - Number of minutes - Number of seconds - Number of milliseconds" durations (+DHHMMSSCCC format)

## Example


```wl
StartTime is Time = "1230"
// Add 50 minutes
StartTime.Minute += 50
// StartTime corresponds to 13:20

// Modify the minutes
StartTime.Minute = 10
```


<a name="Example2"></a>

```wl
Work.StartTime = "1230"
// Add 50 minutes
Work.StartTime.Minute += 50
// StartTime corresponds to 13:20

// Modify the minutes
Work.StartTime.Minute = 10
```

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**

Number of minutes on 2 digits.

**`<Time>: (Time, DateTime or Duration)`**

Name of the variable of type [Time](../Motscles/1514068.md), [DateTime](../Motscles/1514070.md) or [Duration](../Motscles/1514069.md) to be used.

### Modifying the number of minutes in a Time or Date item (in "Date and Time" or "Duration" format)

`<Data file>.<item>.Minute = <New number of minutes>`

## Remarks


### Managing the minutes and the hours
<a name="managing_the_minutes_and_the_hours_ELTPARAGRAPHE000167"></a>

**Case 1: Direct assignment**
During a direct assignment (for example, *MyTime.Minute = n*), the minutes must be included between 00 and 59. A WLanguage error occurs if an invalid number of minutes is specified.
The syntax *MyTime.Minute = MyTime.Minute + 5* may generate an error at run time.

** Case 2: Operations on the minutes**
When performing operations on [Time](../Motscles/1514068.md) and [DateTime](../Motscles/1514070.md), variables, hours go from 0 to 23, and minutes go from 0 to 59. The addition or subtraction of minutes automatically takes into account the changes from 59 minutes to the next hour.

Therefore, if 50 minutes are added to:

- a variable of type [Time](../Motscles/1514068.md) corresponding to 23:35, the result will be 0:25.

- a variable of type [DateTime](../Motscles/1514070.md), the hour and the number of minutes will be modified (an hour will be added).



```wl
// Example on a variable
StartTime is Time = "2335"   
StartTime.Minute += 50
// StartTime corresponds to 0:25 
 
StartTime is DateTime = "202011262335"
StartTime.Minute += 50	
// StratTime corresponds to 27/11/2020 at 0:25
```

### Operators available for the minutes
<a name="operators_available_for_the_minutes_ELTPARAGRAPHE000201"></a>

The following arithmetic operators can be used with the **Minute** property: 

- ++  and  --

- +=  and  -=



```wl
// Example on an item
Work.StartTime = "1320"
Work.StartTime.Minute++     // Add 1 minute
Work.StartTime.Minute+=5     // Add 5 minutes
Work.StartTime.Minute-=5	// Subtract 5 minutes
```
