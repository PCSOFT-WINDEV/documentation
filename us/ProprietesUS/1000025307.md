The **DisplayedSection** property is used to identify and change the portion of the image displayed in an Image control.

This property is mainly used to zoom in an image while displaying only a section of it. This property must be used in an Image control that allows zooming.

## Example


```wl
// Save displayed section
rectSave is Rectangle
rectSave = IMG_Photo.DisplayedSection
// Restore displayed section
IMG_Photo.DisplayedSection = rectSave

// Zoom X2 on top right
rectX2 is Rectangle
rectX2.X = 1000
rectX2.Y = 0
rectX2.Width = 500
rectX2.Height = 500
IMG_Photo.DisplayedSection = rectX2

rectX2.DisplayedSection = O

### Getting the image section displayed in an Image control

`<Result> = <Image control>.DisplayedSection`
---

**`<Result>: (Rectangle variable)`**

[Rectangle](../Motscles/1514079.md) variable that corresponds to the image section displayed.

If the Image control does not contain an image (or contains a generated image (drawing functions)), the rectangle returned will correspond to the control.  

**`<Image control>: (Control name)`**

Name of the Image control to be used.

### Changing the image section displayed in an Image control

`<Image control>.DisplayedSection = <New section displayed>`
---

**`<Image control>: (Control name)`**

Name of the Image control to be used.

**`<New section displayed>: (Rectangle variable)`**



- Name of the [Rectangle](../Motscles/1514079.md) variable that corresponds to the image section to display. 

- 0 to display the entire image in the Image control.

<a name="NOTE0_1"></a>

## Remarks


- The rectangle is expressed in pixels of the image. 

- If the image has multiple DPIs, the rectangle corresponds to 1x zoom. 

- When changing the image section displayed (syntax 2): 

	- Zoom is calculated according to the size of the specified rectangle. 

	- If the rectangle does not have the same x/y ratio as the Image control, the largest ratio is used. 

	- If the rectangle is empty, the action has no effect.
