The **Access** property is used to manage the type of access of a connection (HFSQL Client/Server, OLE DB, etc.). You can:

- Get the type of access used for a connection (HFSQL Client/Server, OLE DB, etc.).

- Define the type of access used for the connection (HFSQL Client/Server, OLE DB, etc.). In this case, if the connection is currently open, it will be closed and opened again with the new parameters when first accessing a data file that uses this connection.




**Remark**: The connection can correspond to:

- a connection defined in the data model editor,

- a connection defined with [HConnect](../WDLang4/3044263.md), [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

- a connection described with a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md).

## Example


```wl
MyConnection is Connection
// Describe the connection
MyConnection.User = "USER"
MyConnection.Password = "PASSWORD"
MyConnection.Server = "MYSERVER" 
MyConnection.Database = "Database"
MyConnection.Provider = hAccessHFClientServer
MyConnection.Access = hOReadWrite
MyConnection.ExtendedInfo = "Extended information"
MyConnection.CursorOptions = hClientCursor

HOpenConnection(MyConnection)
```

## Syntax

### Getting the type of access of a connection

`<Type of access> = <Connection>.Access`
---

**`<Type of access>: (Integer constant)`**

Returns the type of access of the connection: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hORead* | The data files used by the connection can be accessed in read-only mode. You can only read records. You will not be able to add or remove records.<br>![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png) This constant is only available for OLE DB connections. |
| *hOReadWrite* | The data files used by the connection can be accessed in read and write mode. You can read and write new records. |



**`<Connection>: (Character string or Connection variable)`**

Name of the connection used. This name is defined:

- in the data model editor,

- with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md),

- with the [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md) type.

### Defining the type of access of a connection

`<Connection>.Access = <Type of access>`
---

**`<Connection>: (Character string or Connection variable)`**

Name of the connection used. This name is defined:

- in the data model editor,

- with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md),

- with the [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md) type.




**`<Type of access>: (Integer constant)`**

Defines the type of access of a connection: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hORead* | The data files used by the connection can be accessed in read-only mode. You can only read records. You will not be able to add or remove records.<br>![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png) This constant is only available for OLE DB connections. It is ignored in the other cases. |
| *hOReadWrite* | The data files used by the connection can be accessed in read and write mode. You can read and write new records. |

## Remarks
The [CtAccess](../Proprietes/2512015.md) property defines the type of access to a data file used by a connection. This property is kept for backward compatibility. It is recommended to use the **Access** property.

Caution: The **Access** property applies only to "Connection" types. The [CtAccess](../Proprietes/2512015.md) property applies to data files.
