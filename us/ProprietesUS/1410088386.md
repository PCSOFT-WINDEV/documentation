The **spDerivation** property is used to:

- Get the key derivation function used to hash an item of type "Password". This property can be used for items of type "Password" defined in the data model editor or programmatically. 

- Set the key derivation function used for hashing (only for "Password" items defined programmatically).

## Example


```wl
// Describe the AFile file
...

// Describe the "Password" item
MyItem is Item Description
MyItem.Name = "Password"
MyItem.Type = hItemSecurePassword
MyItem.spDerivation = SP_PBKDF2
MyItem.spHash = SP_SHA2_256
MyItem.spIterationCount = 20000
MyItem.spLength = 256

// Validate the description of the "Password" item
HDescribeItem(AFile, MyItem)

// Validate the description of AFile file
...
```

## Syntax

### Getting the key derivation function used ("Password" item)

`<Derivation function> = <Data file>.<Item>.spDerivation`
---

**`<Derivation function>: (Integer constant)`**

Key derivation function used to hash an item of type "Password": 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *SP_PBKDF2* | Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2) is used. |



**`<Data file>: (Character string)`**

Name of the file used. This name was defined in the data model editor or with the [File Description](../WDLang4/1514065.md) type.

**`<Item>: (Character string)`**

Name of the item used. This name was defined in the data model editor or with the [Item Description](../WDLang4/1514071.md) type.  


<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Setting the key derivation function used ("Password" item described programmatically)

`<Item>.spDerivation = <Derivation function>`
---

**`<Item>: (Character string)`**

Name of the item used. This name was defined by the [Item Description](../WDLang4/1514071.md) type.

**`<Derivation function>: (Integer constant)`**

Key derivation function used to hash an item of type "Password": 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *SP_PBKDF2* | Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2) is used. |
