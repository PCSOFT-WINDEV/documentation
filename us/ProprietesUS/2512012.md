The **CtDescribedPassword** property allows you to set the password used to open the data file in an OLE DB connection (file defined in the code only). 


**Reminder**: [HConnect](../WDLang4/3044263.md) is used to redefine one or more parameters of the OLE DB connection to a table. By default, the characteristics of the OLE DB connection are defined:

- in the data model editor during the description of the data file, 

- when the data file is described through programming.



<a name="Example1"></a>
<a name="sample_code"></a>

## Example


```wl
// Set the password to open the Customer data file
Customer.CtDescribedPassword = "Password"
```

<a name="XSYNTAX"></a>
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>
