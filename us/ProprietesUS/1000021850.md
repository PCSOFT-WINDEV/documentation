## Example


```wl
// Allows the size and position to be modified in the window 
// except for the OK button 
WIN_MyWindow.WinEditMode = weSelection + wePosition + weSize
BTN_OK.WinEditAllowed = weNone
WInEdActive(WIN_MyWindow, True)
```


<a name="Example2"></a>

```wl
// Check the authorizations
IF BinaryAND(MySelf.WinEditAllowed, weSelection) = weSelection THEN
	Trace("Selection allowed")
END
```

### Finding out the operations allowed on a control

`<Result> = <Control used>.WinEditAllowed`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer constant (or combination of constants))`**

Combination of the following constants: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *weAddRepositionableNote* | The end user can add a repositionable note into the window.  |
| *weAddWire* | The end user can add a wire between several controls. |
| *weChangeTooltip* | The end user can modify the tooltips of controls. |
| *weChangeWire* | The end user can modify the wires between the controls. |
| *weMoveControl* | The end user can move the controls. |
| *weMultiSelection* | The end user can select several controls at the same time. <br><br>Caution: This constant requires the use of the *weSelection* constant. |
| *wePosition* | The end user can move the controls. |
| *weResizeControl* | The end user can resize the controls. |
| *weSelection* | The end user can select the controls. |
| *weSize* | The end user can modify the size of controls. |



**`<Control used>: (Control name)`**

Name of the control to be used.

### Defining the operations allowed on a control

`<Control used>.WinEditAllowed = <Authorized operations>`
---

**`<Control used>: (Control name)`**

Name of the control to be used.

|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *weAddRepositionableNote* | The end user can add a repositionable note into the window.  |
| *weAddWire* | The end user can add a wire between several controls. |

| *weChangeTooltip* | The end user can modify the tooltips of controls. |
| *weChangeWire* | The end user can modify the wires between the controls. |
| *weMoveControl* | The end user can move the controls. |
| *weMultiSelection* | The end user can select several controls at the same time. <br><br>Caution: This constant requires the use of the *weSelection* constant. |
| *weNone* | The end user cannot modify or select anything in the window. This option is the default option. <br><br>This option cannot be combined with one of the other options. |
