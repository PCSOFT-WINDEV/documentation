The **Database** property is used to manage databases associated with a connection (HFSQL Client/Server, OLE DB, etc.). You can:

- Find out the database associated with a connection (HFSQL Client/Server, OLE DB, etc.).

- Define the database associated with a connection (HFSQL Client/Server, OLE DB, etc.). In this case, if the connection is currently opened, it will be closed and reopened with the new parameters during the first access to a file that uses this connection.




**Remark**: The connection can correspond to:

- a connection defined in the data model editor,

- a connection defined with [HConnect](../WDLang4/3044263.md), [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

- a connection described with a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md).

## Example


```wl
MyConnection is Connection
// Describe the connection
MyConnection.User = "USER"
MyConnection.Password = "PASSWORD"
MyConnection.Server = "MYSERVER" 
MyConnection.Database = "Test"
MyConnection.Provider = hAccessHFClientServer
MyConnection.Access = hOReadWrite
MyConnection.ExtendedInfo = "Extended information"
MyConnection.CursorOptions = hClientCursor

HOpenConnection(MyConnection)
```

## Syntax

### Finding out the database associated with a connection

`<Associated database> = <Connection>.Database`
---

**`<Associated database>: (Character string)`**



- Database used as data source for the connection.

- Empty string ("") if no specific database is associated with the connection.




**`<Connection>: (Name or variable of type Connection)`**

Name of the connection used. This name is defined:

- in the data model editor,

- with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md),

- with the [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md) type.

### Defining the database associated with a connection

`<Connection>.Database = <New associated database>`
---

**`<Connection>: (Name or variable of type Connection)`**

Name of the connection used. This name is defined:

- in the data model editor,

- with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md),

- with the [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md) type.




**`<New associated database>: (Character string)`**



- Database used as data source for the connection.

- Empty string ("") if no specific database is associated with the connection.

## Remarks
The [CtInitialCatalog](../Proprietes/2512018.md) property is used to get the default database of a connection. This property is kept for backward compatibility. It is recommended to use the **Database** property.
