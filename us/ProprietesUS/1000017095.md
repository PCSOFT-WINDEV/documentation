<a name="Overview"></a>
Merging cells is used to merge several cells found in a Table (or TreeView Table) control into a single one: the internal borders of the cells disappear and the text is properly positioned in the new cell. 

Merging cells or column titles is used to create controls that are easier to view (for Table controls used to display statistics for example).

The **Merge** property is used to merge the cells of a Table or TreeView Table control. You can:

- find out whether the cells or the column titles are merged.

- merge the cells or the columns titles.




**Important**: When a cell is merged with the next cell, the content of the cell spreads over the next cell and the content of the next cell is not displayed.

## Example


```wl
// Displays a specific text
TableAdd(TABLE_Customer, "List of customers in California")
// Merges the columns to display the text on all the columns
COL_LastName[1].Merge = mergeNextCell
COL_FirstName[1].Merge = mergeNextCell
```

## Syntax

### Finding out the merge mode

`<Current merge mode> = <Element used>.Merge`
---

**`<Current merge mode>: (Integer constant)`**

Merge mode used on the element:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *mergeNextCell* | Merge the specified cell with the next cell (on the same row). |
| *mergeNextLine* | Merge the specified cell with the cell found on the next row. |
| *mergeNextTitle* | Merge the title of the column with the title of the next column. |
| *mergeNone* | No merge is performed. |



**`<Element used>: (Character string)`**

Name of element used:

- Cell: &lt;Column name&gt; [ &lt;Row index&gt;]

- Title of a column: &lt;Column name>

### Merging the cells or the column titles

`<Element used>.Merge = <Merge mode>`
---

**`<Element used>: (Character string)`**

Name of element used:

- Cell: &lt;Column name&gt; [ &lt;Row index&gt;]

- Title of a column: &lt;Column name&gt;




**`<Merge mode>: (Integer constant)`**

One of the available merge modes:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *mergeNextCell* | Merge the specified cell with the next cell (on the same row). |
| *mergeNextLine* | Merge the specified cell with the cell found on the next row.<br>Caution: the next row must exist otherwise the merge operation has no effect. |
| *mergeNextTitle* | Merge the title of the column with the title of the next column. |
| *mergeNone* | No merge is performed. |


In all the cases, the content of the cells is not merged.

## Remarks


### Chained merge operations
<a name="chained_merge_operations_ELTPARAGRAPHE000112"></a>

If the merged column is the last visible column, the merge operation has no effect.
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Limitations
<a name="limitations_ELTPARAGRAPHE000119"></a>

- The merge operations are canceled when a deletion, an insertion or a sort is performed on the control: they must be re-created.

- The merge operation is available for the cells and columns found in the Table and TreeView Table controls .

- The constants for merging the cells horizontally and vertically cannot be associated.

- Selecting a row that contains merged cells may produce unexpected effects.

- When exporting a Table control (via the context menu or with [TableToExcel](../WDLang1/3074033.md), [TableToClipboard](../WDLang1/1000017062.md), [TableToText](../WDLang1/1000017061.md), [TableToWord](../WDLang1/3074036.md), [TableToXML](../WDLang1/3074037.md)), the merge of columns is ignored.

- The **Merge** property can only be used on Table and TreeView Table controls.

- You have the ability to merge a column title and to keep the non-merged columns (to display the data in value and in percentage for example).
	If the title of the column contains the main title and the title of sub-columns ("Contacts" on the first line, "Nb" and "%" on the second line for example):

	- you may have to modify the title in order for the titles of sub-columns to be aligned (addition of space characters for example).

	- when resizing the sub-columns, the title of the sub-columns will not be resized.
