## Syntax

### Getting the height of resources

`<Result> = <Scheduler control>.ResourceHeight`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**



- Height of the resources in pixels, if the height was modified through programming (with the **ResourceHeight**) property).

- -1 in the following cases: 

	- if the height of the resources is automatically calculated (via the information given in the description window of the control).

	- if the resources are displayed in columns. 







**`<Scheduler control>: (Control name)`**

Name of the Scheduler control used.  


<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Changing the height of the resources

`<Scheduler control>.ResourceHeight = <New height>`
---

**`<Scheduler control>: (Control name)`**

Name of the Scheduler control used.

**`<New height>: (Integer)`**



- New height for the resources expressed in pixels. 

- -1 to automatically calculate the height of the resources from the information given in the description window of the control.

## Remarks


- If the height of the resources is defined with the **ResourceHeight** property, the resources cannot be "anchored" according to the available size. 

- Only the value -1 can be used. The other negative values are ignored.

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) The height of a specific resource can be modified with the [Height](../Proprietes/2510050.md) property using the following syntax:
	
	```txt
	Schedule_Name.Resource["MyResource"].Height = <New value>
	```
