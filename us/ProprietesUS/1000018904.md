The **Weight** property is used to manage the weight of an element in a TreeMap control. You can: 

- Get the weight of an element in a TreeMap control. 

- Change the weight of an element in a TreeMap control.




**Remark**: Modifying the weight of the element also modifies the size of this element in the TreeMap control. The weight was specified when the element was added to the TreeMap by [TreeMapAdd](../WDLang1/1000018814.md).

## Example


```wl
// Retrieves the index of the element selected in the TreeMap control
SelectionIndex is int = TMAP_TreeMap

// The static displays the weight of the selected element
STC_SizeUnzippedFile = TMAP_TreeMap[SelectionIndex].Weight

// If "Zipped file" is checked, 
// the weight of the TreeMap element corresponds to the zipped size of the element 
IF CBOX_ZIP = True THEN
	TMAP_TreeMap[SelectionIndex].Weight = ZippedWeight(TMAP_TreeMap[SelectionIndex]) 
END

Current weight of the element in the specified TreeMap control. 

**`<Element of TreeMap Control>: (Control name)`**

Element of the TreeMap control whose weight is requested. This parameter has the following format:

### Changing the weight of an element in a TreeMap control

`<Element of TreeMap Control>.Weight = <New weight>`
---

**`<Element of TreeMap Control>: (Control name)`**

Element of the TreeMap control whose weight must be changed. This parameter has the following format:
