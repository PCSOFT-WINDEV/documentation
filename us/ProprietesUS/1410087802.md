### Determining how an Image control behaves when clicked

`<Image control> = <Behavior>.Clickable`
---

**`<Image control>: (Control name)`**

Name of the Image control used. 

**`<Behavior>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the Image control is a clickable area. In this case, all mouse events (press, release, hover, double-click, right-click, etc.) are captured by the Image control.

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. In this case, the control does not capture any mouse events. Mouse events are captured by the underlying controls or by the window.
