## Example


```wl
// Create and initialize a Wire control 
// This wire links the BTN_ControlA and BTN_ControlB controls
WireName is Control

WireName <- ControlCreate("", typWire)
WireName.StartControl = BTN_ControlA
WireName.EndControl = BTN_ControlB
WireName.ShapeExtremityStart = shapeDiamond
WireName.ShapeExtremityEnd = shapeCircle
WireName.ShapeExtremitySize = 8
```

### Finding out the type of shape used for the end extremity of a Wire control

`<Result> = <Wire control>.ShapeExtremityEnd`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer constant)`**

Type of shape used: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *shapeNone* | No shape. |
| *shapeSquare* | Shape of end extremity: Square. |
| *shapeArrow* | Shape of end extremity: Arrow. |
| *shapeDiamond* | Shape of end extremity: Diamond. |
| *shapeCircle* | Shape of end extremity: Circle. |
| *shapeTriangle* | Shape of end extremity: Triangle. |



**`<Wire control>: (Control name)`**

Name of the Wire control to be used.

### Modifying the type of shape used for the end extremity of a Wire control

`<Wire control>.ShapeExtremityEnd = <New shape>`
---

**`<Wire control>: (Control name)`**

Name of the Wire control to be used. 

**`<New shape>: (Integer constant)`**

New shape to use at the end of the Wire control: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *shapeNone* | No shape. |
| *shapeSquare* | Shape of end extremity: Square. |
| *shapeArrow* | Shape of end extremity: Arrow. |
