The **CtInitialCatalog** property is used to get the default database defined for the access. You have the ability to identify the default database defined for the connection for example.

This information was specified:

- when the connection was created in the data model editor, 

- when the connection was defined in [HConnect](../WDLang4/3044263.md), [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).




This property can be used for a data file or for a connection defined in the data model editor or through programming.

## Remarks
The **CtInitialCatalog** property is used to get the default database of a connection. This property is kept for backward compatibility. It is recommended to use the [Database](../Proprietes/2512101.md) property to read and change the database of a connection.
