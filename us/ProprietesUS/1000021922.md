## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

### Finding out the speed at which the control moves when moving the scrollbar

`<Result> = <Control used>.ParallaxRateY`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**

Speed at which the control moves (included between 0 and 1000). 

**`<Control used>: (Control name)`**

Name of the control used. 


<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Modifying the speed at which the control moves when moving the scrollbar

`<Control used>.ParallaxRateY = <New speed>`
---

**`<Control used>: (Control name)`**

Name of the control used. 

**`<New speed>: (Integer)`**

Speed at which the control moves (included between 0 and 1000). This parameter is set to 0 by default. 

- If this parameter is set to 0, the control moves as usual when moving the scrollbar found in the window or in the page. 

- If this parameter is set to 500, the control moves half as fast as the other controls, which is used to perform a "parallax scroll" (depth effect). 

- If this parameter is set to 1000, the control does not move when moving the scrollbar found in the window or in the page. This allows you to create fixed buttons for example.
