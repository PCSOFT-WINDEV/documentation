The **SynchroHFSQL** property is used to: 

- get the refresh mode of a Table control based on a data file linked to an HFSQL Client/Server data file. 

- specify the refresh mode of a Table control based on a data file linked to an HFSQL Client/Server data file. 




Remark: This property is equivalent to the option "Synchronize the display" found in the "Content" tab of the description window of Table control: ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Table_Fichier_Synchro%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)

## Example


```wl
// Defines the refresh mode of Table control
TABLE_Customer.SynchroHFSQL = syncModification
// Modify the HFSQL Client/Server file linked to the control
CUSTOMER.ZC = 34980
HModify(CUSTOMER) 
// The Table control will be automatically refreshed if this customer is visible in the control
```

### Getting the refresh mode of a Table control based on a data file linked to an HFSQL Client/Server data file

`<Result> = <Table control based on a data file>.SynchroHFSQL`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer constant)`**

Current refresh mode: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *syncAddition* | Synchronization when adding a record into the data file. |
| *syncNone* | No synchronization is performed. |
| *syncModification* | Synchronization when modifying a record in the data file |
| *syncDeletion* | Synchronization when deleting a record from the data file |



**`<Table control based on a data file>: (Control name)`**

Name of the Table control based on a data file to be used.

### Changing the refresh mode of a Table control linked to an HFSQL Client/Server data file

`<Table control based on a data file>.SynchroHFSQL = <New mode>`
---

**`<Table control based on a data file>: (Control name)`**

Name of the Table control based on a data file to be used.

**`<New mode>: (Integer constant (or combination of constants))`**

New refresh mode: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *syncAddition* | Synchronization when adding a record into the data file. |
| *syncNone* | No synchronization is performed. |
| *syncModification* | Synchronization when modifying a record in the data file<br><br>Caution: Only the rows displayed by the Table control (which means the visible rows) can be automatically modified when modifying the linked HFSQL file. |
| *syncDeletion* | Synchronization when deleting a record from the data file |


Remark: The *syncAddition*, *syncModification* and *syncDeletion* constants can be combined. 
Caution: Increasing the number of supported cases increases the server load.

## Remarks


- This property is ignored for: 

	- Table controls linked to an HFSQL Classic data file,

	- Table controls that handle data files via a Native Connector (also called Native Access),

	- Table controls populated programmatically, etc.




- Caution: Enabling this feature increases the server load when displaying the Table control or when elements are moved within the control.

- The modifications performed in the data file can come from the same application, from another application on the same computer or from another application on another computer.
