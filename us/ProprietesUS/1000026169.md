The **WorkingDirectory** property is used to: 

- get or change the directory used by the HTML Editor control to store the images and CSS sheets of an HTML page.

- get the directory used by the HTML Display control to store the images and CSS sheets of an HTML page.






**Remarks**: 

- HTML Editor control: when the control is used, a working directory is automatically created. This directory is deleted when the window or application is closed.

- HTML Display control: when [HTMLFromEmail](../WDLang1/1410087263.md) is used, a working directory is automatically created to save the images associated with the email. This directory is deleted when the window or application is closed.

### Changing the directory used by the HTML Editor control to store files (images, CSS sheets, etc.)

`<HTML Editor control>.WorkingDirectory = <New directory>`
---

**`<HTML Editor control>: (Control name)`**

<a name="NOTE0_1"></a>

## Remarks


- Images or CSS stylesheets with a file URL (i.e. starting with "file://") cannot be displayed by default when editing text in the HTML Editor control. 

- To display images or CSS style sheets with a file URL (i.e. starting with "file://"), these files must: 

	- be located in the directory specified with the **WorkingDirectory** property.

	- be relative. For example: &lt;img src='myLogo.png' ...




- This directory is initialized with a temporary directory. This directory is deleted when the window or application is closed. For HTML Editor controls, it can be changed with the **WorkingDirectory** property. In this case, the specified directory is not deleted.

- The option in the HTML Editor control ribbon that allows you to insert images into the page automatically copies the images to this directory.
