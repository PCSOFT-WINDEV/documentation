The **LowerValue** property is used to: 

- Get the lower bound of the interval currently selected in a Range Slider control. 

- Change the lower bound of the interval currently selected in a Range Slider control. 




Remark: The [Value](../Proprietes/2510130.md) and **LowerValue** properties are equivalent.

## Syntax

### Getting the lower value of the selected interval

`<Result> = <Range Slider control>.LowerValue`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**

Lower value of the interval currently selected in the control. 

**`<Range Slider control>: (Control name)`**

Name of the Range Slider control used. 


<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Change the lower value of the selected interval

`<Range Slider control>.LowerValue = <New value>`
---

**`<Range Slider control>: (Control name)`**

Name of the Range Slider control used.

**`<New value>: (Integer)`**

New lower value for the interval currently selected in the control.

## Remarks


- To get and change the upper bound of the interval, use [UpperValue](../Proprietes/1000020434.md).

- The **LowerValue** and [UpperValue](../Proprietes/1000020434.md) properties meet the following conditions:

	- The [MinValue](../Proprietes/2510008.md) property is less than or equal to the **LowerValue** property.

	- The **LowerValue** property is less than or equal to the [UpperValue](../Proprietes/1000020434.md) property.

	- The [UpperValue](../Proprietes/1000020434.md) property is less than or equal to the [MaxValue](../Proprietes/2510009.md) property. 


When a value is assigned:

- If the new value is less than the [MinValue](../Proprietes/2510008.md) property, the **LowerValue** property takes the value of the [MinValue](../Proprietes/2510008.md) property.

- If the new value is more than the [UpperValue](../Proprietes/1000020434.md) property, the [UpperValue](../Proprietes/1000020434.md) property is changed to the same value as the **LowerValue**property.

- If the new value is more than the [MaxValue](../Proprietes/2510009.md) property, the **LowerValue** and [UpperValue](../Proprietes/1000020434.md) properties take the value of the [MaxValue](../Proprietes/2510009.md) property.
