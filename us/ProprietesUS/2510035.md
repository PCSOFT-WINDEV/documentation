The **MinHeight** property is used to get and change the minimum height of a control or window.

The minimum height of the controls and windows is 0 by default. However, some controls cannot be resized below the size of their border.

Reminder: The minimum height of a control or window is used during the following operations:

- Window resized by the user.

- Management of anchors.

- Window resized through programming (with the [Height](../Proprietes/2510050.md) property or the [WinSize](../WDLang1/3038020.md) function).

## Example


```wl
// Modify the minimum height of a control
EDT_Edit1.MinHeight = 200
EDT_Edit1.Height = 150
// In fact, the height of the control will be equal to 200
```

## Syntax

### Finding out the minimum height of an element

`<Current minimum height> = <Element used>.MinHeight`
---

**`<Current minimum height>: (Integer)`**

Minimum height of specified element (including the border) expressed in pixels.

**`<Element used>: (Control name or window name)`**

Name of element (window or control) whose minimum height will be calculated.

### Modifying the minimum height of an element

`<Element used>.MinHeight = <New minimum height>`
---

**`<Element used>: (Control name or window name)`**

Name of element (window or control) whose minimum height will be modified

**`<New minimum height>: (Integer)`**

New minimum height of element (including the border) expressed in pixels.

## Remarks


### Initial height (control and window)
<a name="initial_height_control_and_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000092"></a>

The initial height (described in the editor) is returned by the [InitialHeight](../Proprietes/2510043.md) property.

In most cases, the height of an element depends on the [MaxHeight](../Proprietes/2510065.md) and **MinHeight** properties. However, this constraint no longer applies when the height is changed programmatically (with the [Height](../Proprietes/2510050.md) property or the [WinSize](../WDLang1/3038020.md) function).
