The **Plane** property is used to:

- Get the active plane of a window (or report) or the plane to which a control belongs.

- Modify the active plane of a window (or report) or associate a control with another plane.




Remarks: 

- A plane is a "layer": 

	- of a window, 

	- of a report.


Several planes cannot be viewed at the same time (in the window editor, page editor, report editor, or in your applications).

- In a window or in a report, each control can:

	- belong to no plane. This control will always be displayed, regardless of the current plane.

	- belong to a plane. This control will be displayed when the corresponding plane is visible.

	- belong to several planes. This control will be displayed when one of the planes associated with the control is enabled (which means visible).




- The planes in the reports are mainly used to replace the substitution blocks: simply position the controls on several planes and enable the desired plane when print.

## Syntax

### Get the active plane of a window (or report) or the plane to which a control belongs

`<Plane number> = <Element used>.Plane`
---

**`<Plane number>: (Integer or character string)`**



- Number of the active plane in the specified window.

- Number of the active plane in the specified report.

- Number of the plane to which the specified control belongs.

- Numbers of the planes (separated by a comma) to which the control belongs.




**`<Element used>: (Name of control, window or report)`**

Name of the element to be used: 

- Control name. 

- Name of the window. 

- Report name. 





<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Modifying the active plane of a window (or report) or associating a control with another plane

`<Element used>.Plane = <New plane>`
---

**`<Element used>: (Name of control, window or report)`**

Name of the element to be used: 

- Control name. 

- Name of the window. 

- Report name. 




**`<New plane>: (Integer or character string)`**



- Number of the plane to activate. If this number is greater than the number of existing planes, only the controls not assigned to a plane will be displayed.

- Number of the plane associated with the specified control. The control will no longer be displayed if this number does not correspond to the current plane.  

- Numbers of the planes associated with the control. These numbers are supplied in character string format and they are separated by a comma.

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Number of the plane to activate (for the windows only). The plane name was defined in the [plane management window](../WDChamp/1013078.md) in the window editor.

### Plane and window
<a name="plane_and_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000230"></a>

- If a control is assigned to no plane (&lt;None&gt; selected in the description window), this control will always be displayed, regardless of the active plane in the window or report.

- If a control is assigned to a plane, this control will be displayed only if it belongs to the active plane in the window or report.

- If a control is assigned to several planes, this control will be displayed as soon as one of these planes is enabled (which means visible).

- When opening a window or report, the active plane is plane #0.

### Plane and internal window
<a name="plane_and_internal_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000262"></a>

The **Plane** property can be used: 

- directly on the internal window. In this case, this property handles the controls of the internal window. 
	For example, to display plane 2 of the internal window from the host window or directly in the internal window, use the following line of code: 
	
	```txt
	<Name of internal window>.Plane = 2
	```


- directly on the window that hosts the Internal Window control. In this case, the property will only apply to the controls in the host window (including the Internal Window control if it is associated with a plane). The content of the internal window will not be modified. The following line of code should be used: 
	
	```txt
	<Window name>.Plane = 2
	```




<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Plane and internal report
<a name="plane_and_internal_report_ELTPARAGRAPHE000282"></a>

The **Plane** property can be used: 

- directly on the internal report. In this case, this property handles the controls of the internal report. 
	For example, to display the plane 2 of the internal report from the host report or directly in the internal report, use the following code line:
	
	```txt
	<Name of internal report>.Plane = 2
	```


- directly on the window that hosts the Internal Report control. In this case, the property will only apply to the controls in the host report (including the Internal Report control if it is associated with a plane). The content of the internal report will not be modified. The following line of code should be used: 
	
	```txt
	<Report name>.Plane = 2
	```
