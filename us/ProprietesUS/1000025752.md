The **Bearing** property gets or sets the bearing of the map displayed in a Map control.

Caution: bearing changes are taken into account only if the following conditions are fulfilled:

- the map is displayed in satellite mode with a sufficient zoom level,

- the map returned by Google includes the rotate and tilt buttons in the lower right corner.

## Example


```wl
// Change the bearing of the map
MAP_MyMap.Bearing = 90
```

## Syntax

### Getting the bearing of the map

`<Result> = <Map control>.Bearing`
---

**`<Result>: (Real)`**

Bearing of the map, in degrees clockwise from North.

**`<Map control>: (Control name)`**

Name of the Map control used. 


<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Changing the the bearing of the map

`<Map control>.Bearing = <New angle>`
---

**`<Map control>: (Control name)`**

Name of the Map control used. 

**`<New angle>: (Real)`**

New bearing of the map, in degrees clockwise from North.

## Remarks


- The **Bearing** property allows changing the bearing only in Satellite mode, on some areas with a sufficient level of detail and zoom: the tilt button must appear on the map. The bearing can be changed only if the tilt is set to 45. 

- To change the bearing or tilt, wait until the map has been loaded in the right position, in satellite mode and with a sufficient zoom level. 

	- The following code will only work in the page load code. It cannot be used in the click code of a Button control, for example: this would attempt to change the tilt and bearing before the map is loaded with the parameters needed to make such changes: 
			
		```wl
		pb is geoPosition
		pb.Latitude = 49.4295387
		pb.Longitude = 2.0807123
		MapDisplayPosition(MAP_MyMap, pb)
		MAP_MyMap.MapMode = mapModeSatellite
		MAP_MyMap.Zoom = 18
		MAP_MyMap.Tilt = 45
		MAP_MyMap.Bearing = 90
		```


	- To change the position, mode, zoom, tilt and angle in the click code of a Button control, you must defer the tilt and bearing changes. For example:  
			
		```wl
		pb is geoPosition
		pb.Latitude = 49.4295387
		pb.Longitude = 2.0807123
		MapDisplayPosition(MAP_MyMap, pb)
		MAP_MyMap.MapMode = mapModeSatellite
		MAP_MyMap.Zoom = 18
		nTimer is int = Timer(Timer_Callback, 10)
		
			INTERNAL PROCEDURE Timer_Callback()
				MAP_MyMap.Tilt = 45
				MAP_MyMap.Bearing = 180
				EndTimer(nTimer)
			END
		```
