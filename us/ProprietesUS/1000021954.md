The **TimestampType** property is used to:

- Find out the type of timestamp for an item. This item was defined in the data model editor or through programming.

- Define the type of timestamp for a Date, Time or DateTime item (when describing the item through programming).




Reminder: You cannot assign a value to a "Timestamp" item through programming. The date the record was created or last changed will automatically be assigned to it.
