The **MagnifierMode** property determines and changes how the magnifier is displayed in the column headings of a Table or TreeView Table control.

**Remark**: The management mode of the magnifier indicates the operating mode of the Table control when the user clicks the magnifier in the column titles. This management mode is also used by [TableInputSearch](../WDLang1/3074024.md).

## Example


```wl
// Define the mode for using the magnifier
TABLE_Table1.MagnifierMode = filterContains
// Use the magnifier
TableInputSearch(TABLE_Table1.COL_Column1, "")
```

## Syntax

### Finding out the management mode of the magnifier in a Table control

`<Result> = <Control used>.MagnifierMode`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer constant)`**

Current management mode of magnifier in the Table control or in the specified column. This parameter can correspond to one of the following constants:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *filterContains* | A click performed on the magnifier will start a "Contains" filter: only the rows for which the column value "Contains" the specified characters will be displayed. |
| *filterDifferent* | A click performed on the magnifier will start a "Different from" filter: only the rows for which the column value "is different from" the specified characters will be displayed. |
| *filterDoesNotContain* | A click performed on the magnifier will start a "Does not contain" filter: only the rows for which the column value "does not contain" the specified characters will be displayed. |
| *filterDoesNotEndWith* | A click performed on the magnifier will start a "Does not end with" filter: only the rows for which the column value "does not end with" the specified characters will be displayed. |
| *filterDoesNotStartWith* | A click performed on the magnifier will start a "Does not start with" filter: only the rows for which the column value "does not start with" the specified characters will be displayed. |
| *filterEndsWith* | A click performed on the magnifier will start an "Ends with" filter: only the rows for which the column value "does not end with" the specified characters will be displayed. |
| *filterEqual* | A click performed on the magnifier will start an "Equal to" filter: only the rows for which the column value "is equal to" the specified characters will be displayed. |
| *filterGreater* | A click performed on the magnifier will start a "Greater than" filter: only the rows for which the column value "is greater than" the specified characters will be displayed. |
| *filterGreaterOrEqual* | A click performed on the magnifier will start a "Greater than or equal to" filter: only the rows for which the column value "is greater than or equal to" the specified characters will be displayed. |
| *filterLess* | A click performed on the magnifier will start a "Less than" filter: only the rows for which the column value "is less than" the specified characters will be displayed. |
| *filterLessOrEqual* | A click performed on the magnifier will start a "Less than or equal to" filter: only the rows for which the column value "is less than or equal to" the specified characters will be displayed. |
| *filterStartsWith* | A click performed on the magnifier will start a "Starts with" filter: only the rows for which the column value "Starts with" the specified characters will be displayed. |
| *SearchDefault* | Indicates that the column will use the management mode of the magnifier defined for the associated table. This constant is available for the table columns only. |
| *SearchStartsWith* | A click performed on the magnifier will sort the table according to the specified column and will switch this column to search mode: only the rows for which the column value "starts with" the specified characters will be displayed. |



**`<Control used>: (Control name)`**

Name of the table column, Table control or TreeView Table control to use.

### Modifying the management mode of the magnifier in a Table control

`<Control used>.MagnifierMode = <New mode>`
---

**`<Control used>: (Control name)`**

Name of the table column, Table control or TreeView Table control to use.

If the modification is performed on the Table control, this modification affects all the columns with the *SearchDefault* constant (if possible).

If the modification is performed on a table column, the effect is limited to this column.

**`<New mode>: (Integer constant)`**

New management mode of the magnifier in the Table control or in the specified column. This parameter can correspond to one of the following constants:

## Remarks
The **MagnifierMode** property can only be used on Table and TreeView Table controls, as well as on the columns they contain.

The **MagnifierMode** property has no effect:

- on the browsing Table controls with "Direct access".

- on the browsing Table controls that use a scrollbar with an ongoing movement.

- on the columns that display no magnifier and that cannot be sorted.

- on the columns that do not support the requested type of filter (using a *filterContains* filter on a numeric column for example).
