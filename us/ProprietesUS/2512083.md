The **DeletionRule** property is used to configure the deletion rule (integrity management) to be applied to the data file described through programming. You can:

- Find out the deletion rule used for a data file defined in the analysis or through programming

- Define the deletion rule used for a data file (when describing the dynamic link through programming only).

...
// Validate the data file description
HDescribeFile(OrdLine)

## Syntax

### Finding out the deletion rule

`<Deletion rule> = <Link>.DeletionRule`
---

**`<Deletion rule>: (Integer constant)`**

The different deletion rules are as follows:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hIntegrityCascade* | Cascading deletion: all the linked records are deleted in cascade when the key item is deleted from the source file. |
| *hIntegrityDefaultValue* | Default deletion: the linked keys are initialized with their default value when the key item is deleted from the source file. |
| *hIntegrityForbidden* | Deletion not allowed: the key item cannot be deleted from the source file if the record is linked to another record. |
| *hIntegrityNone* | No integrity management: no specific action is performed in the linked file when the key item is deleted from the source file of the link. |



**`<Link>: (Character string)`**

Name of the link defined in the analysis or by the [Link description](../WDLang4/1514039.md) type.

### Defining the deletion rule used in the link defined through programming

`<Link>.DeletionRule = <Deletion rule>`
---

**`<Link>: (Character string)`**

Name of the link used. This name was defined by the [Link description](../WDLang4/1514039.md) type.

**`<Deletion rule>: (Integer constant)`**

The different deletion rules are as follows:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hIntegrityCascade* | Cascading deletion: all the linked records are deleted in cascade when the key item is deleted from the source file. |
| *hIntegrityDefaultValue* | Default deletion: the linked keys are initialized with their default value when the key item is deleted from the source file. |
| *hIntegrityForbidden* | Deletion not allowed: the key item cannot be deleted from the source file if the record is linked to another record. |
