The **Compression** property is used to manage data compression during a connection (HFSQL Client/Server, etc.). You can:

- Find out whether the connection transmits compressed data.

- Define whether the data transmitted between the server and the client must be compressed. In this case, if the connection is currently opened, it will be closed and reopened with the new parameters during the first access to a file that uses this connection.




**Reminder**: The compression of data is used to reduce the volume of data flowing through the transmission media (this feature is interesting for the transmissions invoiced according to the volume of data transmitted). The data compression is supported from version 14 of the HFSQL server. For more details, see [Compressing frames](../WDLang4/1000017306.md).

**Remark**: The connection can correspond to:

- a connection described in the data model editor,

- a connection described by [HConnect](../WDLang4/3044263.md), [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

- a connection described by a [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md) variable.

## Example


```wl
MyConnection is Connection
// Describe the connection
MyConnection.User = "USER"
MyConnection.Password = "PASSWORD"
MyConnection.Server = "MYSERVER" 
MyConnection.Database = "Test"
MyConnection.Provider = hAccessHFClientServer
MyConnection.Access = hOReadWrite
MyConnection.ExtendedInfo = "Extended information"
MyConnection.CursorOptions = hClientCursor
MyConnection.Compression = True

HOpenConnection(MyConnection)
```

## Syntax

### Finding out whether the connection transmits compressed data

`<Result> = <Connection>.Compression`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the transmitted data is compressed, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if the transmitted data is not compressed.




**Remark**: Compression management is available from version 14 of the HFSQL server.

**`<Connection>: (Character string or Connection variable)`**

Name of the connection used. This name was defined:

- in the data model editor,

- by [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md),

- by the [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md) type.

### Defining the data compression for a connection

`<Connection>.Compression = <Data compression>`
---

**`<Connection>: (Character string or Connection variable)`**

Name of the connection used. This name was defined:

- in the data model editor,

- by [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md),

- by the [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md) type.




**`<Data compression>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> to compress the data, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> not to compress the data.




**Remark**: Compression management is available from version 14 of the HFSQL server.
