The **InitialWidth** property is used to:

- **Find out the initial width of a control or window.**
	The initial width corresponds to the width defined in the window editor during the element description. This width can evolve and it can be modified. It is returned by the [Width](../Proprietes/2510059.md) property.

- **Modify the base width used to anchor the controls "in width".**
	When a control is anchored, the base width used to resize the control according to the window is the width defined when the control was created (returned by the **InitialWidth** property).
	To modify the width of a control anchored in width, you must also modify its initial width.

- **Find out the initial width of a report control.**
	The initial width corresponds to the width defined in the report editor during the element description. This width can evolve and it can be modified. This new width is returned by the [Width](../Proprietes/2510059.md) property.

## Example


```wl
// Increases the width of "STC_Title" by 30 millimeters
STC_Title.Width = STC_Title.InitialWidth + 30
```


<a name="Example2"></a>

```wl
// Restores the initial width of control
EDT_Edit1.Width = EDT_Edit1.InitialWidth
// Enlarges TABLE_Table1 that is anchored in width by 30 pixels
TABLE_Table1.Width += 30
TABLE_Table1.InitialWidth += 30
```
