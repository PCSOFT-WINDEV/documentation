## Remarks


### Modifying the writing direction in a window
<a name="modifying_the_writing_direction_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000103"></a>

When the writing direction is reversed in a window (*tdRightToLeft* constant):

- The marker of the window is modified. The window origin (0, 0) changes from the upper-left corner to the upper-right corner. The X-axis is oriented to the left. The anchor of controls is modified accordingly.

- The controls are displayed in "mirror".

- All the controls defined by the *tdDefault* constant are changed to *tdRightToLeft*: the captions of the controls are displayed on the right side of the control, the scrollbars are displayed on the left side of the control, ...

### Modifying the writing direction in a control
<a name="modifying_the_writing_direction_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000114"></a>

When the writing direction is reversed in a control (*tdRightToLeft* constant), only the display mode of the control is modified: the captions of the controls are displayed on the right side of the control, the scrollbars are displayed on the left side of the control, ...
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Required configuration
<a name="required_configuration_ELTPARAGRAPHE000121"></a>

The languages written from right to left are supported by the Windows versions later than Windows 95 and NT4.

To enable this option: 

1. Display the control panel ("Start .. Control panel").

2. Select "Regional and linguistic options".

3. In the "Languages" tab, select "Install the files for the languages with right-to-left complex script".

### Actual writing direction
<a name="actual_writing_direction_ELTPARAGRAPHE000135"></a>

If the writing direction corresponds to the *tdDefault* constant, use the [RightToLeft](../Proprietes/1000017228.md) property to determine the "actual" writing direction. This property returns <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the actual writing direction goes from right to left and <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if the actual writing direction goes from left to right.
