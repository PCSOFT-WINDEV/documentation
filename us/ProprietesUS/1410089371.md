The **Page** property is used to handle the page loaded in the WEBDEV Page control. 

This property only supports the following syntaxes: 

- comparisons with NULL values. 

- calling a procedure. 



<a name="Example1"></a>
<a name="sample_code"></a>

## Example


```wl
// Open the billing window 
IF Open(WIN_Billing, CustomerName, OperationName, Report, Goodies) = True THEN	
	// The invoice has been established. We can request the WEBDEV page to remove the vehicle from the list
	WEBDEV_VehicleList.Page.refresh_row(nRowNum)		
END
```

<a name="XSYNTAX"></a>

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

### Checking if a page is loaded in the control

`IF <WEBDEV Page control>.Page = Null THEN
    ...
    // The control does not contain a WEBDEV page
    ...
END

 IF <WEBDEV Page control>.Page <> Null THEN
    ...
    // The control contains a WEBDEV page
    ...
END`
---


<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Calling a browser procedure of the page

`<WEBDEV Page control>.Page.ProcedureName()`
---


<a name="SYNTAX3"></a>

### Calling a browser procedure of the page with a return value

`AFTER MyResult = <WEBDEV Page control>.Page.ProdcedureName() DO
	// Use of the result
END`
---



<a name="NOTE0"></a>
<a name="NOTE0_1"></a>

## Remarks


- The "After loading the HTML page" event is called when the WEBDEV page is fully loaded. 

- You can call procedures of the WINDEV control from the WEBDEV page using the [MyHostControl](../Motscles/1511028.md) keyword. 

- Call to a procedure: It is possible to pass parameters to the procedure called. 

- In syntax 3 ("Calling a browser procedure of the page with a return value"), the return value is received asynchronously.




- ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WDWEBDEVInWINDEV.gif) ***Training (WINDEV)*** : **WD WEBDEVInWINDEV** <br>This example shows the implementation of "WEBDEV in WINDEV".<br>It explains how to insert a WEBDEV page, a site or part of a site in a WINDEV window and how to establish two-way communication between them in WLanguage.<br>There are multiple use cases for the integration of a WEBDEV page directly in a WINDEV window:<br>- merge existing WINDEV and WEBDEV elements,<br>- progressively webify an application. In this case, simply develop new features in WEBDEV and integrate them into existing WINDEV applications.
