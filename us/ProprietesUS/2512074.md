The **DescribedDirectory** property is used to manage the physical directory of HFSQL files. This property ignores the possible changes of directory performed by [HChangeDir](../WDLang4/3044168.md) or [HSubstDir](../WDLang4/3044028.md). You can:

- Identify the physical directory of a data file defined in the data model editor or through programming.

- Define a physical directory for a data file (when the file is described through programming).









<a name="Example1"></a>
<a name="sample_code"></a>

## Example


```wl
// Define the physical directory of the Orders data file
Orders.DescribedDirectory = "C:\MyFiles"
...
// Validate the data file description
HDescribeFile(Orders)
```

## Syntax

### Finding out the physical directory of a data file

`<Current directory> = <Data file>.DescribedDirectory`
---

**`<Current directory>: (Character string)`**

Name of the directory of the data file. This name ignores the possible changes of directory performed by [HChangeDir](../WDLang4/3044168.md) or [HSubstDir](../WDLang4/3044028.md).

**`<Data file>: (Character string)`**

Logical name of the data file used. This name was defined in the data model editor or with the [File Description](../WDLang4/1514065.md) type.  


<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Defining a physical directory for a data file described through programming

`<Data file>.DescribedDirectory = <New Directory>`
---

**`<Data file>: (Character string)`**

Name of the data file used. This name was defined by the [File Description](../WDLang4/1514065.md) type.

**`<New Directory>: (Character string)`**

Physical name of the directory.

![HFSQL Client/Server](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HFCS.png) The directory of the data file must be relative to the database found on the server. For example: ".\\Data".
