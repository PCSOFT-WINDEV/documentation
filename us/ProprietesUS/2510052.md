The **Timeout** property is used to get and change the time after which the connection is considered to have "failed". This timeout is taken into account when the [StreamConnect](../WDLang3/3039008.md) function and the [Address](../Proprietes/2510017.md) property are used.

The default timeout is set to 2 minutes by default.
