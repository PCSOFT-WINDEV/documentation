The **NdxEncryption** property is used to configure the encryption method for the index (.NDX) file associated with the data file. You can:

- Identify the encryption method of an index file associated with a data file (file defined in the data model editor or through programming).

- Defining the encryption mode of an index file associated with a data file during its description through programming.

## Syntax

### Identifying the encryption method of an index file

`<Current encryption mode> = <Data file>.NdxEncryption`
---

**`<Current encryption mode>: (Integer constant)`**

The encryption modes are:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hEncryptionAES128* | Encryption is performed only if a password is set for the data file. In this case, the index file is encrypted using a 128-bit AES algorithm with Output feedback (OFB). |
| *hEncryptionAES192* | Encryption is performed only if a password is set for the data file. In this case, the index file is encrypted using a 192-bit AES algorithm with Output feedback (OFB). |
| *hEncryptionAES256* | Encryption is performed only if a password is set for the data file. In this case, the index file is encrypted using a 256-bit AES algorithm with Output feedback (OFB). |
| *hEncryptionAuto* | Encryption is performed only if a password is set for the data file. In this case, the index file is encrypted according to an optimized encryption algorithm (RC5 16 rounds on 128 bits). |
| *hEncryptionNO* | No encryption is performed on the index file. |
| *hEncryptionRC5_12* | The index file is encrypted using an optimized 12-round RC5 encryption algorithm (128 bits). |
| *hEncryptionRC5_16* | The index file is encrypted according to an optimized encryption algorithm (RC5 16 rounds on 128 bits). |
| *hEncryptionStandard* | The index file is encrypted according to an optimized encryption algorithm (on 128 bits). |



**`<Data file>: (Character string)`**

Name of the data file used. This name was defined by the [File Description](../WDLang4/1514065.md) type.

### Defining the encryption method for the index file

`<Data file>.NdxEncryption = <New encryption mode>`

**`<Data file>: (Character string)`**

Name of the data file used. This name was defined by the [File Description](../WDLang4/1514065.md) type.

**`<New encryption mode>: (Integer constant)`**

The encryption modes are:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hEncryptionAES128* | Encryption is performed only if a password is set for the data file. In this case, the index file is encrypted using a 128-bit AES algorithm with Output feedback (OFB). |

## Remarks


### 128-bit, 192-bit and 256-bit AES encryption with the OFB mode of operation
<a name="128bit_192bit_and_256bit_aes_encryption_with_the_ofb_mode_operation_ELTPARAGRAPHE000133"></a>

- If the index file is encrypted using the AES algorithm, the same encryption method must be used for the memos ([MmoEncryption](../Proprietes/2512014.md) property) and the data ([FicEncryption](../Proprietes/2512046.md) property). 

- If there is encryption that uses the AES algorithm, the option "Enable a high-security level " is automatically applied.
