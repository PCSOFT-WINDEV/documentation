The **AccentSensitive** property is used to determine if accented characters are taken into account in the different searches performed on the item or full-text index (with [HReadSeek](../WDLang4/3044050.md), [HReadSeekFirst](../WDLang4/3044036.md) and [HReadSeekLast](../WDLang4/3044034.md), for example). You can:

- Find out whether the accented characters are taken into account in the searches performed on this item (or on this full-text index). The item or the full-text index has been defined in the data model editor or through programming.

- Define the management of accented characters for an item or for a full-text index (when the item or the full-text index is described through programming).

## Remarks


### Search performed on an "accent-sensitive" item
<a name="search_performed_accentsensitive_item_ELTPARAGRAPHE000111"></a>

When a search is performed on an "accent-sensitive" item, only the words with matching accented characters will be found. Therefore, if the customer name is "Renée", the search performed on:

- "Renée" will find the record, 

- "Renee" will not find the record.



<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Configuring the different search options for an item
<a name="configuring_the_different_search_options_for_item_ELTPARAGRAPHE000121"></a>

- To make searches accent-sensitive or insensitive, use the **AccentSensitive** property.

- To make searches case-sensitive or insensitive, use the [CaseSensitive](../Proprietes/2512085.md) property.

- To make searches punctuation-sensitive or insensitive, use the [PunctuationSensitive](../Proprietes/2512087.md) property.
