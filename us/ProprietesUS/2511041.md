- The **NbRecRead** property returns the number of records selected by the source of the report (query, view, memory area or Table control).

- The [NbPrintedRec](../Proprietes/2511058.md) property returns the number of records selected both by the source of the report AND by the filter code (if any).

- The **NbRecRead** and [NbPrintedRec](../Proprietes/2511058.md) properties return the same value for a report based on a file: the number of records in the file AND selected by the filter code (if any).

- The [TotalNbRec](../Proprietes/2511047.md) property is used to determine and change the number of records to print. The number of records to print will be included between 1 and [NbPrintedRec](../Proprietes/2511058.md).
