### Finding out the upper value of the selected interval

`<Result> = <Range Slider control>.UpperValue`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**

Upper value of the interval currently selected in the control. 

**`<Range Slider control>: (Control name)`**

<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Modifying the upper value of the selected interval

`<Range Slider control>.UpperValue = <New value>`

## Remarks


- To get and set the lower bound of the interval, use the [LowerValue](../Proprietes/1000020433.md) or [Value](../Proprietes/2510130.md) properties.

- The [LowerValue](../Proprietes/1000020433.md) and **UpperValue** properties meet the following conditions:

	- The [MinValue](../Proprietes/2510008.md) property is less than or equal to the [LowerValue](../Proprietes/1000020433.md) property. 

	- The [LowerValue](../Proprietes/1000020433.md) property is less than or equal to the **UpperValue** property.

	- The **UpperValue** property is less than or equal to the [MaxValue](../Proprietes/2510009.md) property. 


When a value is assigned:

- If the new value is less than the [MinValue](../Proprietes/2510008.md) property, the [LowerValue](../Proprietes/1000020433.md) and **UpperValue** properties take the value of the [MinValue](../Proprietes/2510008.md) property.

- If the new value is less than the [LowerValue](../Proprietes/1000020433.md) property, the [LowerValue](../Proprietes/1000020433.md) property is modified and takes the same value as the **UpperValue**property.

- If the new value is more than the [MaxValue](../Proprietes/2510009.md) property, the **UpperValue** property takes the value of the [MaxValue](../Proprietes/2510009.md) property.
