The **MmoPackMethod** property is used to set the compression mode of the MMO file (containing text and binary memos) associated with the data file. You can:

- find out the compression mode of a memo file (data file defined in the data model editor or through programming).

- modify the compression mode of the memos (data file defined through programming only).

## Example


```wl
// Description of a data file through programming
AFile is File Description
// Modify the compression mode of this data file
AFile.MmoPackMethod = hPackZLW
```

## Syntax

### Finding out the compression mode of the memos

`<Current compression mode> = <Data file>.MmoPackMethod`
---

**`<Current compression mode>: (Integer constant)`**

The two compression modes are:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hPackNo* | No compression is performed on the memo file. |
| *hPackZLW* | The memo file is compressed according to the Ziw-Lempel algorithm, Welch implementation. |



**`<Data file>: (Character string)`**

Name of the data file used. This name was defined in the data model editor or with the [File Description](../WDLang4/1514065.md) type.

### Defining the compression mode of the memos

`<Data file>.MmoPackMethod = <New compression mode>`
---

**`<Data file>: (Character string)`**

Name of the data file used. This name was defined by the [File Description](../WDLang4/1514065.md) type.

**`<New compression mode>: (Integer constant)`**

The two compression modes are:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hPackNo* | No compression is performed on the memo file. |
| *hPackZLW* | The memo file is compressed according to the Ziw-Lempel algorithm, Welch implementation. |
