The **ImageMode** property is used to get and change: 

- the display mode of an image,

- the alignment of image,

- the HQ mode of image. 




This property can be used:

- for an Image control,

- for an Image table column,

- for the background of a Chart control found in a window,

- for a Button control.




**Remark**: The display mode of an image is defined in the window editor or in the page editor in the control description ("General" tab).

For example:


|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![Normal image](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=img_100.gif)<br>Normal image | ![Centered image](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=img_centre.gif)<br>Centered image | ![Stretched image](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=img_etire.gif)<br>Stretched image |
| ![Homothetic centered image](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=img_homo.gif)<br>Homothetic centered image | ![Tiled image](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=img_repete.gif)<br>Tiled image |   |

## Example


```wl
// Modify the display mode of image found in the "IMG_CarImage" control
IMG_CarImage.ImageMode = imgTiled
```


<a name="Example2"></a>

```wl
// Modify the display mode and the alignment mode of image found in "IMG_CarImage"
IMG_CarImage.ImageMode = imgNormal + imgAlignVBottom
```
<a name="Example3"></a>

```wl
// Management of large fonts: the image is not enlarged because a drawing will be performed
IMG_CarImage.ImageMode = IMG_CarImage.ImageMode + imgNoScale
```

## Remarks


### Finding out the display mode and the alignment mode of an image (syntax 1)
<a name="finding_out_the_display_mode_and_the_alignment_mode_image_syntax_1_ELTPARAGRAPHE000439"></a>

The **ImageMode** property returns a single value representing both the image display and alignment mode. 

To separate the alignment information from the display information, a binary filter must be applied in order to subtract the display mask or the alignment mask from the result ([BinaryAND](../WDLang1/3050010.md)). 

Tip: To only retrieve the value corresponding to the alignment mode, apply a binary mask whose value is the reunion of all alignment constants. The remaining constant will be the alignment constant used in the image. For example: 


```wl
CurrentMode is int
MaskAlignmentMode is int
AlignmentMode is int

CurrentMode = IMG_Photo.ImageMode

MaskAlignmentMode = imgAlignHCentered + imgAlignHRight + imgAlignVBottom + imgAlignVCentered

AlignmentMode = BinaryAND(CurrentMode, MaskAlignmentMode)
Info(AlignmentMode)
```



### Limits
<a name="limits_ELTPARAGRAPHE000455"></a>

The **ImageMode** property applies only to:

- the Image controls, 

- the Image columns found in the Table controls,

- Chart controls in windows, 

- the Button controls.




![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) The **ImageMode** property applies only to Image controls.

![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) If the display mode is modified through programming, the content of the image must be re-assigned to view the changes.
