The **InitialHeight** property is used to:

- **Find out the creation height of a control or window.**
	The creation height corresponds to the height defined in the window editor during the description of the object. This height can evolve and it can be modified. It is returned by the [Height](../Proprietes/2510050.md) property.

- **Modify the base height used to anchor the controls "in height".**
	When a control is anchored, the base height used to calculate how the control is resized according to the window is the height defined when the control was created (returned by **InitialHeight** property).
	To modify the height of a control anchored in height, its initial height must also be modified.

- **Find out the creation height of a control or block in a report.**
	The creation height corresponds to the height defined in the report editor during the description of the object. This height can evolve and it can be modified. This new height is returned by the [Height](../Proprietes/2510050.md) property.

## Example


```wl
// Increases the height of "STC_Title" by 30 millimeters
STC_Title.Height = STC_Title.InitialHeight + 30
```
<a name="Example2"></a>

```wl
// Restores the initial height of the control
EDT_Edit1.Height = EDT_Edit1.InitialHeight
// Enlarges TABLE_Table1 that is anchored in height by 30 pixels
TABLE_Table1.Height += 30
TABLE_Table1.InitialHeight += 30
```

## Syntax

### Finding out the creation height

`<Creation height> = <Element used>.InitialHeight`
---

**`<Creation height>: (Integer)`**

Initial height of the specified object (including the border). This height is expressed in pixels in a window and/or in a page, and in millimeters in a report.

**`<Element used>: (Name of control, window or block)`**

Name of the element (control, window or report block) whose initial height must be calculated.

### Modifying the initial height of a control anchored in height

`<Control used>.InitialHeight = <New height>`
---

**`<Control used>: (Control name)`**

Name of the anchored control whose initial height must be modified.

**`<New height>: (Integer)`**

New initial height of the anchored control (including the border) expressed in pixels.
