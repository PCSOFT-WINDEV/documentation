The **spHash** property is used to:

- Get the algorithm used for salting an item of type "Password". This property can be used for items of type "Password" defined in the data model editor or programmatically. 

- Set the algorithm used for salting (only for "Password" items described programmatically).

## Example


```wl
// Describe the AFile file
...

// Describe the "Password" item
MyItem is Item Description
MyItem.Name = "Password"
MyItem.Type = hItemSecurePassword
MyItem.spDerivation = SP_PBKDF2
MyItem.spHash = SP_SHA2_256
MyItem.spIterationCount = 20000
MyItem.spLength = 256

// Validate the description of the "Password" item
HDescribeItem(AFile, MyItem)

// Validate the description of AFile file
...
```
