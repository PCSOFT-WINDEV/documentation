The **ProgressBarSystem** property is used to get and change the progress bar used as system progress bar (in the taskbar) with Windows 7 (and later). 

**Reminder**: From Windows 7, a progress bar can be displayed in the taskbar for a given window. By default, this progress bar corresponds to:

- the progress bar of the status bar if this progress bar exists. 

- the first visible progress bar of the window if the window includes a progress bar.


This automatic behavior can be modified with the **ProgressBarSystem** property.

// Progress Bar control linked to the progress bar 7
MyWindow.ProgressBarSystem = PROGBAR_ProgBar1..Name
PROGBAR_ProgBar1.MinValue = 0
PROGBAR_ProgBar1.MaxValue = 100
FOR i = 1 TO 100
	PROGBAR_ProgBar1.Value = I
	Multitask(10)
END
// Progress bar of the taskbar linked to the progress bar 7
MyWindow.ProgressBarSystem = ProgressBarStatusBar
FOR i = 1 TO 100
	ProgressBar(i, 100)
	Multitask(10)
END
