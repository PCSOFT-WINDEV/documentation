- **XImage**: used to define the initial X coordinate of the image section.

- [YImage](../Proprietes/2510046.md): used to define the initial Y coordinate of the image section.

- [ImageHeight](../Proprietes/2510044.md): used to define the height of the image section.

- [ImageWidth](../Proprietes/2510066.md): used to define the width of the image section.
