The **AddChildDelayed** property indicates the procedure to be called when a row in a TreeView or TreeView Table control is clicked to be expanded. This procedure populates only the expanded branches.

This optimizes the control population procedure. 

**Remark**: To optimize how TreeView and TreeView Table controls based on a data file are populated, check "Delayed fill of sub-levels (faster)" in the "Content" tab of the control description window.

## Example


```wl
sDir is string = fListDirectory("C:", frNotRecursive)
FOR EACH STRING sADir OF sDir SEPARATED BY CR
	nLine is int = TableAddLine(TVT_Explorer, sADir)
	// If this directory has children
	sChild is string = fListDirectory(sADir, frNotRecursive)
	IF sChild <> "" THEN
		// Call to the AddDirectory procedure 
		// when the user clicks [+]
		TVT_Explorer[nLine].AddChildDelayed = AddDirectory
	END
END
```

```wl
PROCEDURE AddDirectory(sParentID is string)
nIndex is int

sParentDir is string = TVT_Explorer.COL_NoName1[sParentID]
sParentDir = Replace(sParentDir, TAB, fSep())
sDirList is string = fListDirectory(sParentDir, frNotRecursive)
nIndex = Val(sParentID) + 1
nIndex2 is int = nIndex
FOR EACH STRING sDir OF sDirList SEPARATED BY CR
	sID is string = Replace(sDir, "\", TAB)
	TableAddChild(TVT_Explorer, nIndex-1, sDir)
	sSubDirList is string = fListDirectory(sDir, frNotRecursive)
	IF sSubDirList <> "" THEN 
		TVT_Explorer[nIndex2].AddChildDelayed = AddDirectory
	END
	nIndex2 = nIndex2 + 1
END
```

## Syntax

### Modifying the procedure to execute

`<Element>.AddChildDelayed = <WLanguage procedure>`
---

**`<Element>: (Character string)`**

Row of the Table or TreeView Table control to use. 

**`<WLanguage procedure>: (Procedure name)`**

Name of the WLanguage procedure to be executed when the element is clicked. 

**For TreeView controls**, the procedure has the following format: 


```txt
PROCEDURE <Procedure name>(<ParentPath> is string)
```


where &lt;ParentPath&gt; corresponds to the full path of the row to expand. 

**For TreeView Table controls**, the procedure has the following format: 


```txt
PROCEDURE <Procedure name>(<ParentID> is int)
```


where &lt;ParentID&gt; corresponds to the number of the row to expand. 

If this parameter is an empty string (""), no procedure will be associated with the element.

## Remarks


### Operating mode
<a name="operating_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000056"></a>

If the **AddChildDelayed** property corresponds to the name of a procedure: 

- a "+" sign is displayed on the row in the control.

- the first time the user tries to expand the row (by clicking the "+" sign for example), the procedure is called, allowing to add child elements. Then, the branch is expanded.
	If no child element is added, the "+" sign is deleted from the element.




Once the procedure has been executed (the branch has been populated), an empty string is assigned to the **AddChildDelayed** property: it will no longer be executed. 


### Special cases
<a name="special_cases_ELTPARAGRAPHE000072"></a>

- The specified procedure will be executed BEFORE the "Collapse/expand a node" event of the control. 

- When the [TableExpand](../WDLang1/1000010007.md) or [TreeExpand](../WDLang1/3018007.md) functions are called, if the specified branch has a procedure associated via the **AddChildDelayed** property, this procedure will be executed. 

- When the [TableExpandAll](../WDLang1/1000010001.md) or [TreeExpandAll](../WDLang1/3018022.md) functions are called, if the specified branch and/or one of its children has an associated procedure via the **AddChildDelayed** property, this procedure will be executed.
