The **MaxWidth** property is used to get and change the maximum width of a control or window.

By default, the maximum width:

- of a control is equal to 2 147 483 647 (0x7FFFFFFF). This value is equivalent to "no maximum size limit".

- of a window is equal to 20 000. However, the size of windows should not exceed the size of the screen.




**Reminder**: The maximum width of a control or window is used during the following operations:

- Window resized by the user.

- Management of anchors.




The maximum width of a control or window is not used when the window is resized through programming (with the [Width](../Proprietes/2510059.md) property or [WinSize](../WDLang1/3038020.md) function).

## Syntax

### Finding out the maximum width of an element

`<Current maximum width> = <Element used>.MaxWidth`
---

**`<Current maximum width>: (Integer)`**

Maximum width of specified element (including the border) expressed in pixels.

**`<Element used>: (Window name or control name)`**

Name of the element (window or control) used.  


<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Modifying the maximum width of an element

`<Element used>.MaxWidth = <New maximum width>`
---

**`<Element used>: (Window name or control name)`**

Name of the element (window or control) used.

**`<New maximum width>: (Integer)`**

New maximum width of element (including the border) expressed in pixels.

## Remarks


### Initial width (control and window)
<a name="initial_width_control_and_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000087"></a>

The initial width (defined in the editor) is returned by the [InitialWidth](../Proprietes/2510067.md) property.

In most cases, the width of an object depends on the **MaxWidth** and [MinWidth](../Proprietes/2510062.md) properties. However, this constraint no longer applies when the width is changed through programming (with the [Width](../Proprietes/2510059.md) property or the [WinSize](../WDLang1/3038020.md) function).
