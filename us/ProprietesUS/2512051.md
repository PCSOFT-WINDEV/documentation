The **ModificationRule** property is used to configure the modification rule (integrity management) to be applied to the data file described in the code. You can:

- Find out the modification rule used for a data file defined in the analysis or by programming.

- Define the modification rule used for a data file (when the link is described by programming).

## Syntax

### Finding out the modification rule

`<Modification rule> = <Binding>.ModificationRule`
---

**`<Modification rule>: (Integer constant)`**

The different modification rules are as follows:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hIntegrityCascade* | Cascading modification: all the linked records are modified in cascade when the key item is modified in the source file. |
| *hIntegrityDefaultValue* | Default modification: the linked keys are initialized with their default value when the key item is modified in the source file. |
| *hIntegrityForbidden* | Modification not allowed: the key item cannot be modified in the source file if the record is linked to another record. |
| *hIntegrityNone* | No integrity management: no specific action is performed in the linked file when the key item is modified in the source file of the link. |



**`<Binding>: (Character string)`**

Name of the link defined in the analysis or by the [Link description](../WDLang4/1514039.md) type.
