Some controls of WINDEV and WEBDEV can [manage drag-and-drop operations automatically](../WDLang1/3030012.md): simply check the corresponding option in the "Details" tab of the control description. A control can be defined as source or target of a drag-and-drop operation.

Drag-and-drop operations are automatically available: 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) for Edit, List Box, ListView and TreeView controls.


In a [drag-and-drop operation set programmatically](../WDLang1/3030013.md), the **DndSource** and [DndTarget](../Proprietes/2510016.md) properties are used to define the Drag and Drop source and target controls.

The **DndSource** property is used to determine and change a control's drag and drop behavior (List, ListView, Looper, TreeView, etc.). This control will be defined as source for Drag and Drop, which means that Drag and Drop will be performed from this control.

## Example


```wl
// -- Initialization of LIST_Source
// LIST_Source is not a target
LIST_Source.DndSource = dndInactive

// -- Initialization of LIST_Target
LIST_Target.DndTarget = dndProgram
DndEvent("Drop", "LIST_Target", dndDrop)
DndEvent("DragOver", "LIST_Target", dndDragOver)
```
