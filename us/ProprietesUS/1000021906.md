The **MaxNbSegment** property is used to get and change the maximum number of line segments for drawing a Wire control.

## Example


```wl
// Add a waypoint to the wire so that it follows the desired path
Waypoint1, Waypoint2 are Points 

Waypoint1.X = 280
Waypoint1.Y = 54

Waypoint2.X = 320
Waypoint2.Y = 54
WIRE_MyWire.MaxNbSegment = 20

WIRE_MyWire = [Waypoint1, Waypoint2]
```

## Syntax

### Finding out the maximum number of line segments for a Wire control

`<Result> = <Wire control>.MaxNbSegment`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**



- Maximum number of line segments making up the Wire control, 

- 1 corresponds to the drawing of a single line between two controls. 




**`<Wire control>: (Control name)`**

Name of the Wire control to use.


<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Modifying the maximum number of line segments for a Wire control

`<Wire control>.MaxNbSegment = <New maximum number>`
---

**`<Wire control>: (Control name)`**

Name of the Wire control to use.

**`<New maximum number>: (Integer)`**



- Maximum number of line segments making up the Wire control, 

- 1 corresponds to the drawing of a single line between two controls. 




Remark: If the Wire control can be drawn with less segments, the drawing is automatically simplified.
