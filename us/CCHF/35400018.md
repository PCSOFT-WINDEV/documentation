## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000100"></a>
The HFSQL Control Center is used to implement the automatic server update. 

If this option is enabled, the HFSQL server can be automatically updated as soon as a new version is available: 

- on the PC SOFT server. 

- on a custom server.

## Implementation

### How to?
<a name="how_ELTPARAGRAPHE000021"></a>

To implement the automatic server update: 

- In the dashboard of HFSQL Control Center, in the "Version" widget, click "Configure the updates". The window for server configuration is displayed, click "Version". 

- From the ribbon for server characteristics, in the "Parameters" group, click "Server configuration" and display the version options.

The Control Center indicates whether the server is updated or whether an update is available. In this case, the HFSQL server can be immediately updated via the "Update server" button.

You also have the ability to configure an automatic update. In this case, the update will be automatically performed as soon as a server update is detected. 

When "Enable automatic update" is selected: 

- a wizard starts. This wizard proposes to use: 

	- the PC SOFT update server: This server contains the last updates of the HFSQL server validated by our Quality Department. 

	- a custom server. In this case, the URL of the custom update server must be specified (see next paragraph). 




- the wizard proposes to schedule the check of the update server (once a month for example). 
	Remark: If a new version is available during the check, the HFSQL server will be stopped and the users will be disconnected during the entire update. 





### Custom update server
<a name="custom_update_server_ELTPARAGRAPHE000153"></a>

You can use a custom update server for the HFSQL server. This allows you to control the HFSQL server updates of the users. You can for example validate the use of a new version before releasing it. 

To create a custom update server for HFSQL servers, you must: 

1. Install a Web server (IIS or Apache) on the selected computer. 

2. Create the following MIME types on the Web server if they do not exist:

	- .json -> application/json

	- .sign -> application/byte-stream

	- .zip  -> application/x-compress




3. Create a directory at the root of the Web server. This directory will contain the update packs. Example: C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\hfsql_packs
	This directory must contain: 

	- A json file containing the names of the packs to be used according to the versions (see below). The name of this file must be "hfsql_updateinfo.json".

	- The packs corresponding to the updates (packs in zip format with ".zip" extension).

	- The signature files corresponding to the packs (".sign" extension).


 These packs and their signatures are available from the following address: [http://package.windev.com/hfsql/](http://package.windev.com/hfsql/). 




For example: 

- Web server for updates: srvupd

- UNC directory containing the updates: \\\\srvupd\\hfsql_packs\\

- URL for updates: http://srvupd/hfsql_packs/




Example of Json file: 


```txt
{
	"pack": [
		{
			"major_version": 22,
			"language"     : "F",
			"version"      : "220099",
			"min_version"  : "220036",

			"pack": [
				{
					"platform": "win32",
					"data"     : "srv_hfsql_win32_90F220099z"
				},
				{
					"platform": "win64",
					"data"     : "srv_hfsql_win64_90F220099z"
				},
				{
					"platform": "linux32",
					"data"     : "srv_hfsql_linux32_90F220099z"
				},
				{
					"platform": "linux64",
					"data"     : "srv_hfsql_linux64_90F220099z"
				}
			]
		}
	]
}
```
where: 

- **major_version**: corresponds to the major version of the pack (22, 23, ...). Only the HFSQL servers corresponding to this version will be updated. 

- **language**: corresponds to the server language (F for French, A for English, ...). 

- **version**: corresponds to the version of the HFSQL server found in the pack. 

- **min_version**: corresponds to the minimum version from which the pack can be applied. 

- **pack**: used to give the characteristics of the packs. 

- **platform**: platform corresponding to the pack: 

	- win32: 32-bit Windows

	- win64: 64-bit Windows

	- linux32: 32-bit Linux

	- linux64: 64-bit Linux




- **data**: corresponds to the name of the pack (without extension). 




Remark: A single pack may be referenced according to the platform used by the HFSQL servers.
