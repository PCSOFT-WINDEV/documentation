When you open an analysis in the HFSQL Control Center, the ribbon shows the following options: 

- In the "Manage files" group: 

	- **Synchronize files**: This option starts the automatic modification of data files in order to synchronize the data files and their description in the analysis. This operation is performed via a wizard. 

	- **Add a deployment directory**: This option is used to select a directory where the data files corresponding to the analysis will be sought. 

	- **Manage .REP files**: This option lists the locations of the data files saved in the .REP file linked to the analysis. You can add files to and delete files from the .REP file. 




- In the "Files" group: This group appears for the tabs used to access data files. In particular, it allows direct access to data files. For HFSQL data files, it is also possible to launch an optimization and repair of data files.
