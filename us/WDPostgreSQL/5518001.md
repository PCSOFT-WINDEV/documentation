## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000145"></a>
WINDEV and WEBDEV 28 include a Native PostgreSQL Connector (or Native PostgreSQL Access), available in 32 and 64-bit mode. This Native Connector allows you to access a PostgreSQL database from a WLanguage program without using any external driver.

**Caution**: This version of the Native PostgreSQL Connector works with WINDEV and WEBDEV version 28.

**Remark**: The Native PostgreSQL Connector is an optional and free module that can be downloaded from [the PC SOFT site](https://www.windev.com).

### Conditions for using a Native Progress Connector
<a name="conditions_for_using_native_progress_connector_ELTPARAGRAPHE000029"></a>

We recommend that you use a recent PostgreSQL client layer, whose version is identical to the version of your server if possible.

To do so, you must:

- Copy the DLLs of the PostgreSQL client layer to the WINDEV or WEBDEV installation directory on the development computer. 
	Remark: You must also copy all the dependencies provided with the client layer.

- Copy the DLLs of the PostgreSQL client layer to the executable directory or to the Windows directory on the development computer. 
	Remark: You must also copy all the dependencies provided with the client layer. 

- Install the DLLs of Visual runtime (package that can be downloaded from Microsoft site).
	Remark: The version of the visual runtime depends on the PostgreSQL client layer.




**In 32-bit mode**, if these DLLs are not found, the Native PostgreSQL Connector will use a standard client layer (PostgreSQL version 7.4.23). It contains all the necessary features for the Native Connector and is compatible with servers up to version 9.6. If you use a server in a more recent version, install a version of the client layer compatible with your server. 

![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) The PostgreSQL client layer should be installed with the Linux distribution package manager. Dependencies will also be installed. 
Example (Debian): 

```txt
apt-get install libpq5
```


**Remark**: To use the SSL connections, you must install a PostgreSQL client layer version 9.1 or later.

### Specific file distributed with Native PostgreSQL Connector
<a name="specific_file_distributed_with_native_postgresql_connector_ELTPARAGRAPHE000060"></a>

To use Native PostgreSQL Connector: 

- in 32-bit mode, only the ***wd280postgresql.DLL*** DLL is required. This file is provided with the Native PostgreSQL Connector for WINDEV and WEBDEV.

- in 64-bit mode, only the ***wd280postgresql64.DLL*** DLL is required. This file is provided with the Native PostgreSQL Connector for WINDEV and WEBDEV.

### Using Native PostgreSQL Connector in your WINDEV applications and WEBDEV sites
<a name="using_native_postgresql_connector_your_windev_applications_and_webdev_sites_ELTPARAGRAPHE000078"></a>

To use PostgreSQL in native mode, you must program in the WINDEV application or in the WEBDEV site:

- with the "SQL" functions of WLanguage (see [Programming with SQL functions](../WDPostgreSQL/5518004.md)). 

- with the "HFSQL" functions of WLanguage (see [Programming with HFSQL functions](../WDPostgreSQL/5518003.md)). 




**Remarks**: 

- Don't forget to read the [limitations of the Native PostgreSQL Connector.](../WDPostgreSQL/5518002.md)

- The "Automatically create the data files if they do not exist" option (in the "Files" tab of the project description) is taken into account by the Native PostgreSQL Connector.
