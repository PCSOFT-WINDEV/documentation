### WDReplic
<a name="wdreplic_ELTPARAGRAPHE000011"></a>

WDReplic is a tool used to manage the replication of data between several computers that use the same application.

**Reminder**: The replication is the operation allowing you to keep updated remote databases of identical structures on which several operations are performed. The operations performed on each one of the databases are applied to all the other databases.

**Caution**: To use WDReplic, the application database must be configured to support the replication. Contact your application provider for more details (or see the online help of WINDEV).
