## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000091"></a>
Configuring a replication requires several steps:

1. Defining the replication characteristics

	- Defining the replication mode (bidirectional, unidirectional, ...).

	- Defining the replication media (portable replica, network, ...).

	- Selecting the working directory.

	- Selecting the analysis and validating the files to replicate.




2. Defining the different elements (master, subscribers)

	- Defining the master.

	- Defining the subscriber sites.

	- Defining the common space.




3. Creating the setup procedures


When all these steps are performed, the replication can be used.

To configure the replication, WDReplic must be started on the computer where the database of master replica is installed.

Then, all you have to do is click "I want to implement a replication" and let the wizard guide you:

The setup procedures are self-extractable ZIP files that must be run on the master computer and on the subscriber computers.
