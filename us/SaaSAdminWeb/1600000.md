- Viewing the reports used for invoicing.

To access the SaaS administrator, you must connect to the following address:


```txt
http://<serveur>/WDAdminSaaS280
```
ou


```txt
http://<serveur>/WD280AWP/WD280AWP.exe/CONNECT/WDAdminSaaS280
```


where &lt;server&gt; represents the address (name or IP address) of WEBDEV Application Server.

To use the site of SaaS administrator, you must authenticate yourself with a username and password.

By default, the "**admin**" username (with the **admin** password) can be used once the WEBDEV Application Server is installed.

**Remark**: The password of the "admin" account must be changed as soon as possible in order to prevent any access by an unauthorized person. Indeed, the "admin" account has all the rights for SaaS configuration on the Application Server.
