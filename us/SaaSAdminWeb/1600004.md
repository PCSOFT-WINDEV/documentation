## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000119"></a>
Adding a SaaS client account is used to make a SaaS site available to the users.

In most cases, a client account represents a company whose members are the users.

Adding a client account must be performed after the deployment of the site, after the declaration of the SaaS services and after the creation of the pricing.

**Remark**: This operation is equivalent to the call to [SaaSAdminAddClient](../WDLang3/1000019113.md).





## How to?
