These elements are:

| Element | Role |
| --- | --- |
| *SaaS site* | The **SaaS site** is a WEBDEV site deployed on a WEBDEV Application Server. It is associated with a SaaS Webservice used to control the site. |
| *Service* | The **Services** are the different features of a site. |
| *Client Account* | A **Client Account** represents a company that uses the **SaaS site**.<br>Each **Client Account** includes its own database and its own custom version of the **SaaS site** (logo, graphics, etc.). |

## Using the SaaS administrator
<a name="using_the_saas_administrator_ELTTEXTE000264"></a>
To exploit a SaaS site, the following operations must be performed:

1. Deploying the SaaS site on a WEBDEV Application Server. 
	For more details, see: [Deploying a site](../Editeurs/2028039.md).
	During the deployment, you have the ability to specify the address of the SaaS Webservice that will handle the site.
	The SaaS Webservice can be located on the same application server as the site (by default) or on a different application server.
	The operations for SaaS configuration will be performed thereafter via the SaaS Administrator located on the same application server as the Webservice.

2. Declaring the site in the SaaS Administrator. 
	For more details, see [Adding a SaaS site into the Administrator](../SaaSAdminWeb/1600002.md).

3. Declaring the services proposed by the site in the SaaS Administrator. 
	For more details, see [Managing a SaaS site in the administrator](../SaaSAdminWeb/1600003.md).

4. Creating the pricing for the site in the SaaS Administrator. 
	For more details, see [Managing a SaaS site in the administrator](../SaaSAdminWeb/1600003.md).

5. Adding the client accounts into the SaaS Administrator. 
	For more details, see [Adding a SaaS client account](../SaaSAdminWeb/1600004.md).

6. Adding one or more users for the SaaS client accounts. 
	For more details, see [Managing the SaaS client accounts](../SaaSAdminWeb/1600005.md).

7. Subscribing the SaaS client accounts to the pricing of the SaaS site and assigning some licenses. 
	For more details, see [Managing the SaaS subscriptions](../SaaSAdminWeb/1600006.md).




Remark: If you propose to send the security code to the user (forgotten password), you must configure the SMTP email serveur associated with the SaaS administrator. This configuration can be performed: 

- through programming, via [SaaSAdminConfigureSMTP](../WDLang3/1000022592.md). 

- in the SaaS administrator, via the "SMTP configuration" link found in the dashboard.
