WINDEV Mobile allows you to create control templates. A control template is a set of controls that can be re-used in several windows.

Changes made to a control template are automatically applied to all the windows that use the template.

A control template is used to:

- group a set of controls for a specific purpose.

- make the controls independent of the host window.

A control template can be created:

- via the ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P1_ICO_Cr%E9er_cpt.gif)
 icon in the quick access buttons. In the "New" window, click "Window" then "Control template".

- from the controls in the window (select the controls and right-click, in the context menu that appears, select "Refactoring .. Create a control template from the selection").




To create a window based on a control template, create a "Control template" control.

The characteristics of the elements can be dissociated from the template. For example, dissociate the position of a control from the template to move it elsewhere while keeping other changes (code, style, etc.). This is referred to as **control inheritance**. In this case, the elements are identified by a blue square.
