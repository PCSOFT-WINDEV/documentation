WINDEV Mobile includes several communication functions for different fields.

These functions allow you to:

- manage emails (POP3, IMAP and SMTP protocols),

- transfer files via FTP,

- perform HTTP and HTTPS requests,

- use the telephony,

- perform SOAP requests (to access SOAP, J2EE or .Net Webservices),

- manage SMSs,

- use TCP sockets (with automatic use of the SSL protocol) and UDP sockets, 

- use Infrared or Bluetooth sockets.




The availability of these functions depends on the features of the device that is running the application.
