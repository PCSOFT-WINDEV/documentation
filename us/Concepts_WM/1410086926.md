WINDEV Mobile allows you to synchronize the records used by multiple applications on different platforms.

Thus, applications manage the same data independently. For example, when data is synchronized, the changes made in the database used by the PC are automatically reflected on the mobile device, and vice versa.

This synchronization is done automatically via **Universal Replication**.

## Universal replication
<a name="universal_replication_ELTTEXTE000129"></a>
The universal replication updates databases (with the same or different formats) used by several applications. For example, you can synchronize an HFSQL database with an Oracle database.

Universal replication uses a centralized model: all databases are synchronized with a master database. Then, the master database reflect the changes in the other databases.

The synchronization can be adapted to special cases. For example, you can retrieve the records related to a specific product or created on a given date, manage conflicts, display a configuration window, etc.

These adaptations must be done through programming with [HRplFilterProcedure](../WDLang4/3044300.md).
