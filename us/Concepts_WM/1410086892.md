The UI (User Interface) of an application is mainly composed of windows.

WINDEV Mobile includes an advanced window editor allowing you to easily and quickly create all possible types of UI, for all types of platforms. 

These are some of the features that allow you to get intuitive and user-friendly applications:

- powerful controls.

- anchors to make the UI fit a given screen size. This mechanism is useful in mobile application development because it is used to adapt to different screen resolutions.

- a UI compilation system with error detection (empty titles, untranslated text, overlaps, etc.).
