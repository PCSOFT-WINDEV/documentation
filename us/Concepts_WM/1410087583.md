Smart controls are an innovative concept for creating UIs. A Smart control is a ready-to-use control (or group of controls) that includes a "business logic" WLanguage code where necessary.

Smart controls allow implementing sophisticated operations in WINDEV Mobile applications with one click.

WINDEV Mobile includes many Smart controls: Sign In with Apple, Facebook, Camera, PIN input, Finger signature, etc.

To integrate a Smart control in your UI: 

1. On the "Creation" tab, in the "Smart" group, click "Smart controls".

 Remark: The "Go" button that appears when hovering over the Smart controls allows you to see and try the control before integrating it in your window. 

3. Select the desired control, drag it and drop it onto the window editor.
