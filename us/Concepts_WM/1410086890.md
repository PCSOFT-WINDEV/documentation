WINDEV Mobile covers the entire application development cycle:<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P10-Cycle%20de%20d%E9veloppement%20d'une%20application.gif)
**Details of the different phases**:

**Design phase**: An application can be designed from specific requirements, a UML modeling of the processes or even from existing data files.

**Development phase**: The project and the analysis are created via specific wizards. The application can be developed in RAD (Rapid Application Development) mode, with automatic code and interface generation; or it can result from manually creating multiple project elements.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P11-Cycle%20de%20d%E9veloppement%20d'une%20application-phases.gif)
**Test and generation phase**: WINDEV Mobile includes several automated test tools to build reliable applications and make sure there are no regressions between the development phases.

**Deployment phase**: There are different methods to deploy a WINDEV Mobile application: to the Mobile device directly, via a download, via Play Store, MarketPlace, App Store or Windows Store. In any case, the HFSQL data files (if any) will be automatically updated based on the changes made to the application.
