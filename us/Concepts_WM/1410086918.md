HFSQL Classic is the database format used with WINDEV Mobile. This format is compatible with WINDEV, WINDEV Mobile and WEBDEV.

It is a freely distributable Relational Database Management System (DBMS).

This format can be used on iOS, Android and Universal Windows 10 Apps.

This format is identical to HFSQL Classic in WINDEV and WEBDEV (".WDD" file, data files, etc.).

However, due to limited available space on mobile devices, HFSQL Classic does not support the following features:

- transactions.

- logs.

- locks for files and records.

- files in Hyper File 5.5 format.

<a name="handling_hfsql_classic_database_from_mobile_device_ELTTEXTE000135"></a>
An HFSQL Classic database is a set of ".FIC", ".NDX" and ".MMO" files.

Each data file can be handled by a WINDEV Mobile application. To do so, the application uses HFSQL functions (**Hxxx** functions). ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=pocketPc_HF.gif)
