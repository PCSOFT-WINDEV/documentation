Most organizations use a standardized appearance and layout for their print jobs: date in the upper-right corner in a specific format, page footer with print time and file name, logo in the upper-left corner, etc.

Report templates are used to easily standardize report layouts.

Elements from the template are identified by a yellow square.
Overridden template elements are identified by a blue square.

A report template can be created:

- via the ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P1_ICO_Cr%E9er_cpt.gif)
 icon in the quick access buttons. In the "New" window, click "Report", and then "Report template". 

- from the current report (on the "Home" tab, in the "General" group, expand "Save" and select "Save as a template").


To create a report based on a template, select the template that will be used when creating the report.

The characteristics of the elements can be dissociated from the template. For example, dissociate the position of a control from the template to move it elsewhere while keeping other changes (code, style, etc.). This is referred to as **inheritance**. In this case, the elements are identified by a blue square.
