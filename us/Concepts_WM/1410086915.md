When a WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile project uses data files, it must be associated with an analysis. An analysis is used to describe the data structures (data files, items, etc.) used in your project.

The data model editor allows you to easily create an analysis.

The analysis of a WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile project corresponds to the LDM (Logical Data Model). The analysis contains the entire structure and data organization: data is grouped into files (data files). Each file contains multiple data fields, called items.

In the analysis, the description of a data file can be linked to a type of file (HFSQL Classic, HFSQL Client/Server, SQLite, etc.).
