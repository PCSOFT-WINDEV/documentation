New projects are often cross-platform.

For example, for an ERP system on Windows, it is very likely that beside the main application, there will be sales agents equipped with PDAs or smartphones, stores with mobile devices for inventory management, and Intranet and Internet sites.

**All elements, excluding the UI (pages and windows), are 100% compatible and can be shared between WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile projects**.

It is thus possible to share sets of procedures or classes, for example, between several projects.

A project can be opened in any IDE regardless of the one that was used to create it.

A project in WINDEV displays the thumbnails of the WEBDEV pages and WINDEV Mobile windows, for example. Clicking a WEBDEV page from the WINDEV project editor opens the WEBDEV page (WEBDEV must be installed on the computer). |

**Remark**: If you have WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile, you can handle WINDEV Mobile configurations from WINDEV. You can open, modify and test mobile windows.
