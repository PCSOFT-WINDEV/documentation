Project configurations allow you to easily define the "target" platforms of the project. Multiple executables, components and libraries can be defined for the same project.

You can select each configuration individually to generate the corresponding program.

There is a faster method: the **multiple generation**. You can select and generate the desired configurations with one single action.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2_Generation%20multiple%20mobile%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)
To start a multiple generation, go to the "Project" tab, "Generation" group and click "Multiple generation".
