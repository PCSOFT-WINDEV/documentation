The project dashboard is an essential element for managing WINDEV Mobile projects. It shows an overall and detailed view of the project's progress.

The project dashboard includes several indicators about the project content: 

- project statistics, 

- incidents, 

- tasks, 

- status of automated tests, 

- result of different audits, 

- list of elements checked out from the SCM (Source Code Manager), 

- result of action plans (continuous integration), etc.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2_Tableau%20de%20bord.gif&type=thumb)





The elements in this dashboard are displayed as widgets. These widgets can be configured, moved, enabled, disabled, etc. You can also add new indicators. 

The dashboard configuration is saved for each user. The dashboard configuration is the same for all the projects of a given user.
