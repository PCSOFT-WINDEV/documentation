Project configurations allow you to adapt the same project to multiple "targets".

From the same project, you can create:

- applications with different elements, names, etc.

- different external or internal components,

- cross-platform applications.




You can work on a specific configuration at any time: the elements that do not belong to this configuration appear grayed out in the "Project explorer" pane.

The multiple generation allows you to generate all project configurations (or some of them) in a single operation.
