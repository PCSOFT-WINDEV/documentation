## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000132"></a>
To simplify teamwork, WINDEV Mobile includes a Source Code Manager. 

The Source Code Manager allows developers to work together on the same project at the same time and share elements between multiple projects.
<br>![A repository contains a collection of project elements. Each computer has a local copy of the elements required for development](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P34-GDS.gif)


Elements in the SCM can be shared:

- via [PCSCloud (paid turnkey solution, on a dedicated server)](https://pcscloud.net/UK/cloud_development.awp),

- via [SCMDrive (paid turnkey solution, on a shared server)](https://pcscloud-drive.net/UK/SCMDrive/index.awp).

- via a network,

- via the Internet, 

- in offline mode. In this case, the necessary elements will be checked out from the SCM when the laptop is connected to the main system, for example.

## Operating mode of the Source Code Manager

The following example presents the Source Code Manager:
<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=GestionnaireDeSources.gif)


A project element (window, report, etc.) can only be checked out by one developer at a time.

Once the checked out elements are modified, they must be checked back in so that the source project can take the changes into account. The repository stores a history of all the project elements since they were created.

Each time an element is checked back in, the version number of the source project is incremented by 1.
