WINDEV Mobile allows you to manage business rules. A business rule is used to define a specific operating mode or particular process. For example: the calculation of a specific VAT rate, the rules for changing the status of a customer, the formula for calculating shipping costs, a commercial commission, a discount rate, a decay coefficient, etc.

A business rule can be simple or complex.

Business rules can come from specifications (corresponding to requirements).
