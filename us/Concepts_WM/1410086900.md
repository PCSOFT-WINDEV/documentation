WINDEV Mobile allows you to easily create and print all types of reports with the report editor.

A report can be used to summarize and synthesize data.

You can:

- group data.

- sort data based on different criteria.

- perform calculations (means, statistics, etc.) and create charts.




The diagram below illustrates the concept of reports:

- the data to print comes from a data source (data file described in an analysis, HFSQL view, query, memory area or text file).

- the report groups, sorts and formats the data.

- the report can be executed as a PDF file.

WINDEV Mobile also allows you to print using WLanguage functions (iXXX functions).
