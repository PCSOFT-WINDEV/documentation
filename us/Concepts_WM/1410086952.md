The examples provided with WINDEV Mobile are designed to help you discover its features. Their source code is clear and includes comments.

These examples can be opened directly from the WINDEV Mobile home window: 

- If the example is not installed on the computer, it will be automatically downloaded (from a PC SOFT server) and opened.

- If the example is installed on the computer, a copy is automatically created in "My projects\\My examples".


The open example corresponds to the copy of the original example. This allows you to work or make changes to this copy. The original example can be kept unchanged. Every time you open the example (via the "Open an example" option), you can work on the copy or on the original version. 

Below are some features of the examples provided with WINDEV Mobile.
