By testing the project you can simulate how the application will run. This allows you to test the entire application, even if it is still being developed.

WINDEV Mobile includes several types of project tests:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
|   | <br><br>- **Test on the development computer**. This test simulates a mobile device on the development computer. No connection to a device is required for this test. You can use the debugger. However, since the test is run on a PC and not on the device itself, the application may behave differently.<br><br><br> |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Logo_IOS.gif)<br> | <br><br>- **Real test (iPhone or iPad)**. You can test the iOS application directly on a mobile device. Simply: <br><br>	- download the WMDEV application (available on the store) to the device. <br><br>	- scan the bar code displayed by WINDEV Mobile, which corresponds to the application to be tested. <br><br><br> This option allows you to test the application directly on the device. The debugger is available. <br><br><br> |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Logo_IOS.gif)<br> | <br><br>- **Test on an iPhone/iPad simulator**. The iOS application can be directly tested on Mac when compiling the project in Xcode. This option does not require an iPhone or iPad to run the tests but it provides a more faithful execution than the "simulator" mode.<br><br><br> |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=LOGO_Android.gif)<br> | <br><br>- **Test and debug on an Android device connected to the development computer**. This test allows you to use the debugger even though it is run on the mobile device.<br><br><br> |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=LOGO_Android.gif)<br> | <br><br>- **Test on the Android emulator**. The Android SDK is provided with an Android emulator. The application can be tested in the emulator. This option does not require an Android device to run the tests but it provides a more faithful execution than the "simulator" mode.<br><br><br> |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=logo_Windows_10.gif)<br> | <br><br>- **Real test (PC or mobile device)**. You can test a Universal Windows 10 App on a Windows 10 computer. This option allows you to run your project in tile mode, from Windows 10 directly. The Universal Windows 10 App is automatically generated.<br><br><br> |
