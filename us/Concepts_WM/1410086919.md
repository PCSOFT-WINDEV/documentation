A WINDEV Mobile application can also use an HFSQL database in Client/Server mode.

The characteristics of the Client/Server mode are as follows:

- An HFSQL Client/Server application can be run on different mobile devices (client computers).

- Data files are located on a server. Only the server physically accesses the data files.

- All processes (queries, read from and write records to a data file, etc.) are performed on the server.
