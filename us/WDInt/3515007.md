## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000192"></a>
Once all the resources used in your project (framework libraries, Automatic Application Features (AAF), etc.) have been translated, you must:

- Reintegrate the translated text (".wdmsg" files) and generate the WDM translation file.  

- Copy the WDM translation file to your project's "EXE" directory.

- Load the WDM translation file(s).

### Reintegrating the translated text and generating the translation file
<a name="reintegrating_the_translated_text_and_generating_the_translation_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000022"></a>

To reintegrate the translated text and generate the corresponding translation file:

1. Start the WDINT wizard: on the "Project" tab, in the "Translate" group, expand "Translate" and select "WDInt - Framework translation".

2. Select "Reintegrate the translated messages into the WDM translation file". Go to the next step of the wizard. 

3. Select: 

	- The wdmsg file containing the translated messages. This file was created when translating with WDTRAD. 
			Remark: If you used a TXT or ".fic" file, select the file corresponding to the language to reintegrate. 

	- Select the language of the translations to be reintegrated. 

	- Select the WDM translation file to generate.
			By default, the name of the generated WDM file corresponds to the language in which the text will be reintegrated. Go to the next step of the wizard. 




4. WDINT reintegrates the translated text into the selected WDM translation file.

### Loading the WDM translation file
<a name="loading_the_wdm_translation_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000054"></a>

Each WDM translation file can be associated with the corresponding language:

- in the project description: 

	- On the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, click "Description".

	- Go to the "Languages" tab of the project description. 

	- In the "Miscellaneous" tab, choose the extraction file in "Translation WDM file". 




- programmatically using [LoadError](../WDLang1/3054003.md) or [Library,Error](../LangageExt/75130255.md) for external languages (in WINDEV applications only). For more details, see "Examples".




**Remark**: The WDM translation file must be located in the same directory as the executable (in test mode, this file must be in the project's EXE subdirectory).

## Remarks
<a name="remarks_ELTTEXTE000246"></a>


- To define the runtime language of your project (captions, messages, etc.), use [Nation](../WDLang1/3054014.md).

- If the WDM translation file is not loaded, the framework messages (".DLL" files), the AAFs and the advanced control interfaces will be displayed:

	- in French if you are using a French version of WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile to develop your project.

	- in English if you are using an English version of WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile to develop your project.




- When the setup is created, the files in the "EXE" directory of the project are automatically included in the setup program.

### Using translated text in a project developed in WLanguage
<a name="using_translated_text_project_developed_wlanguage_ELTPARAGRAPHE000109"></a>

This example shows how to use the translated text in a project developed in WLanguage:


```wl
// LANGUAGE is a radio button 
SWITCH LANGUAGE 
	CASE 1: //French 
		Nation(nationFrench) 
	CASE 2: //Spanish 
		Nation(nationSpanish) 
		IF LoadError("SPANISH.WDM")>0 THEN 
			Error("File of messages in Spanish not found. ", ...
				"The messages will be displayed in French.") 
	END 
END
