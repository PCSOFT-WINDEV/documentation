## Overview

WDINT allows you to create a file containing text to be translated and start the WDTRAD translation tool. WDTRAD features a dictionary where you can save your translations. Thus, data already translated is automatically found in the dictionary in subsequent translations.

## Creating a file of messages to translate
<a name="creating_file_messages_translate_ELTTEXTE000101"></a>
To create a translation file:

1. In the WDINT wizard, select "Check out the messages to translate". Go to the next step of the wizard. 

2. Select the language of messages to check out.

3. Specify the name and path of the file to be generated. This file will contain the messages to translate in the selected extraction language. By default, the file name is "framework.wdmsg" and it is saved in the "Personal" subdirectory of the product used. 
	Remark: The "wdmsg" file format corresponds to the format used by the [WDtrad](../WDTrad/3518010.md) translation tool (supplied with WDINT). 

4. Generate the file that contains the messages to be translated. 
	Caution: This generation may take a long time. 

5. At the end of the wizard, WDINT automatically launches WDTRAD if it has been installed on the computer.
