## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000274"></a>
Via the Control Centers, WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile propose several tools allowing the developer to manage his development schedule as well as the different tasks associated with this schedule.

To manage the tasks and the schedule, you must:

1. [Create and configure the database of the Control Centers (if necessary)](#NOTE2).

2. [Configure the Project Monitoring Center (schedules, holidays, etc.)](#NOTE3).

3. [Work on a task](#NOTE4).

4. [Work on an incident](#NOTE5).

## Step 1: Database of Control Centers
<a name="step_1_database_control_centers_ELTTEXTE000298"></a>
The database of Control Centers groups various information shared by the different modules found in WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile.

Configuring the database of Control Centers consists in indicating the location of this database and the format of the files used. **This step is very important**.

For more details, see [Configuring the database of Control Centers](../CCSuivi/3540720.md).

## Step 2: Configure the Project Monitoring Center
<a name="step_2_configure_the_project_monitoring_center_ELTTEXTE000322"></a>
To manage the tasks and the schedule, the Project Monitoring Center must be started and configured.

**Remark**: This part presents the configuration required for using the tasks and the schedule. We assume that the Project Manager has defined the contributors, the schedule, the tasks and requirements. For more details, see [How to manage a development project](../CCSuivi/3540722.md).

**To start the Project Monitoring Center**:

1. Start the Project Monitoring Center from WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile: on the "Tools" tab, in the "Control Centers" group, click "Project Monitoring".

2. Identify yourself to start the Project Monitoring Center with your identifier and password.

3. The Project Monitoring Center is displayed with 4 default tabs: 

	- Dashboard. 

	- The task list entered by the Project Manager. 

	- The incidents. 

	- The requirements.







**Tip**: For each project, you have the ability to create a specific debugging task (with a duration estimated to 0). This task allows you to use the time management when debugging the application.

### Configuring schedules and holidays
<a name="configuring_schedules_and_holidays_ELTPARAGRAPHE000082"></a>

To configure your schedules:

1. Expand ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CC_Suivi_Configuration%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)
 and select "Schedules and holidays".

2. Specify the working days and the working hours (days and hours during which you will be working). For more details, see [Configuring schedules](../CCSuivi/3540706.md).

3. Validate.




Enter the corresponding holidays if you know them.

1. Expand ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CC_Suivi_Configuration%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)
 and select "Schedules and holidays".

2. Specify the working days and the working hours (days and hours during which you will be working). For more details, see [Configuring holidays](../CCSuivi/3540706.md).

3. Validate.

### Configuring the time management help
<a name="configuring_the_time_management_help_ELTPARAGRAPHE000109"></a>

The time spent on a task is calculated differently, depending on whether the time management help is enabled or not.

**If the time management help is enabled**: The calculation of the time spent on a task takes into account:

- the information specified in the task wheel and in the window for managing the current task. The working hours and the working days specified in the options of Project Monitoring Center are ignored.

- the automatic lock of the current task when closing the Windows session.

- the automatic lock of current task when closing the Project Monitoring Center of WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile.




In this case, the information entered in the schedule configuration is taken into account only when establishing the schedule. The schedule takes into account the time really spent.

**If the time management help is not enabled**: The calculation of the time spent on a task only takes into account the working times and the working days specified in the schedule configuration. The "overtime" is not taken into account.

**To configure the time management help**: 

1. Expand ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CC_Suivi_Configuration%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)
 and select "Options".

2. Click "Time management help" and enable or disable the time management help. For more details, see [Time management help](../CCSuivi/3540711.md).

## Step 3: Work on a task
<a name="step_3_work_task_ELTTEXTE000358"></a>
To work on a task: 

1. Display the Project Monitoring Center by using one of the following methods: 

	- on the "Tools" tab, in the "Control Centers" group, click "Project Monitoring". 

	- display the "Project Monitoring Center" pane: on the "Home" tab, in the "Environment" group, expand "Panes", select "Panes", and then select "Project Monitoring Center".




2. Select the desired task and click "Start task" in the context menu.

3. If a task is already in progress, the Project Monitoring Center automatically proposes to suspend or to end the current task.

4. When the task is completed, simply click "Complete task" in the context menu.

## Step 4: Working on an incident
<a name="step_4_working_incident_ELTTEXTE000382"></a>
To work on an incident: 

1. Display the Project Monitoring Center by using one of the following methods: 

	- on the "Tools" tab, in the "Control Centers" group, click "Project Monitoring". 

	- display the "Project Monitoring Center" pane: on the "Home" tab, in the "Environment" group, expand "Panes", select "Panes", and then select "Project Monitoring Center".




2. For each project, create a specific debugging task (with a duration estimated to 0). This task allows you to use the time management when debugging the application.

3. Start the debugging task corresponding to the Customer project.

4. Fix the incidents. The incidents are visible in the "Incidents" panes of Project Monitoring Center.

5. In the "Incidents" tab, flag the incident as fixed.
	Tip: The information regarding the correction should be presented in details when the incident is validated. Indeed, the specified text will be automatically used in the help for the new features when creating the application setup.

6. Change task if necessary.

### Remark: Creating a task from an incident
<a name="remark_creating_task_from_incident_ELTPARAGRAPHE000218"></a>

In some cases, a problem signaled by a customer may require a proper development task. 

In this case, a development task can be created from a customer incident directly from the "Incidents" pane.

For more details, see [Managing incidents](../CCSuivi/3540723.md).
