## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000130"></a>
The following steps must be performed to implement the requirements:

1. [Creating a list of requirements](../CCSuivi/3540717.md). This list can group the necessary requirements for a new software version.

2. [Creating the requirements](../CCSuivi/3540717.md).

3. Assigning dependencies to requirements (tasks, business rules, ...).

4. Monitoring the requirements.

### Overview
<a name="overview_ELTPARAGRAPHE000027"></a>

A requirement is the description of a feature. To implement this feature, dependencies must be associated with this requirement. These dependencies can be tasks to perform, bugs to correct or business rules to implement.

In a development team, the dependencies are added by the project manager. The project contributors see new tasks being added to their task list, and they can modify the duration assigned to the task.

### Assigning dependencies
<a name="assigning_dependencies_ELTPARAGRAPHE000036"></a>The dependencies are added from the window for managing requirements, via the following toolbar:

These icons allow you to:

- **Link a new task or an existing task to the requirement**. This task can be a development task, a test task or a documentation task.
	The simple creation of a task enables you to create a task linked to the selected requirement.
	The multiple creation allows you to create a set of tasks linked to the selected requirement. A development task, a test task and a documentation tasks are proposed by default.
	The assignment of an existing task enables you to list all the tasks belonging to a contributor in order to select the requested task.

- **Link a new incident or an existing incident to the requirement**. If the incident already exists (via user feedback for example), you have the ability to find the incidents per application.

- **Link a new business rule or an existing business rule to the incident**. If the business rule already exists, a search window enables you to quickly select the requested business rule.




As soon as the different dependencies are entered, the window for managing requirements is automatically refreshed. Various information is displayed:

- The status of the requirement and the status of its dependencies: a requirement can be "Not scheduled", "In progress", "Locked", ... The general status of the requirement is deduced from the status of its dependencies.

- The status of the different types of action (development, documentation and test)

- The contributors. The list of contributor is deduced from the contributors linked to the requirement dependencies.

- The availability date is calculated according to the task list assigned to the different contributors.

- The rate for task completion, the rate for rule validation and the rate for fixing the incidents associated with the requirement.

## Monitoring the requirements

### Window for managing the requirements
<a name="window_for_managing_the_requirements_ELTPARAGRAPHE000066"></a>

The window for managing the requirements gives the manager a global view of the progress of a requirement or set of requirements.

Several filters are used to select the requirements to display.  

The "Impact study" tab provides an overview of the progress and quality of a list of requirements. This tab is used to get:

- A vision of the impact of the requirements: Several tables and charts are used to find out the number of requirements per department and per contributor as well as their status.

- A vision of the impact of the tasks: Several charts are used to display the number of tasks affected by the requirements and their progress.

- A vision of the impact of the incidents: Several charts are used to display the number of incidents affected by the requirements as well as their progress.

- Project elements: The list of project elements affected by the requirements (by the business rules for instance).




The first three visions can be displayed according to different modes (General, Development, Test and Documentation) and they can take various complexity coefficients into account.
