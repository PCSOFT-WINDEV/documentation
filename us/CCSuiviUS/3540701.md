## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000326"></a>
The Project Monitoring Center is used to organize and schedule a project, from design to delivery. It allows you to define the tasks that must be performed in a project, the developers working on it, the duration, progress status, etc.

Once the project tasks have been defined, you can follow their progress in the Project Monitoring Center. Entering the time spent on a task is almost automatic, it requires no specific action and it generates no particular constraint. For more details, see [Time management](../CCSuivi/3540713.md).

When the relevant project is opened, the Project Monitoring Center requests or indicates the current task. As soon as a task is completed, simply indicate that the task is finished and specify the new task.

A task can be linked to a project element (window, report, etc.). When the element is opened, the time spent on it is counted and saved in the Project Monitoring Center. Conversely, the element that corresponds to the desired task can be automatically opened from the task list.

Each developer can also see their own task list in the "Project Monitoring Center" pane.

## Start
<a name="start_ELTTEXTE000350"></a>
To start the Project Monitoring Center:

- from WINDEV, WINDEV Mobile or WEBDEV: on the "Tools" tab, in the "Control Centers" group, click "Project Monitoring".

- run "CCSuivi.EXE", which is located in the "Programs" subdirectory of the WINDEV, WINDEV Mobile or WEBDEV installation directory.




The Project Monitoring Center allows presents data to users via different views: 

- Dashboard. 

- [Tasks](../CCSuivi/3540704.md).

- [Incidents](../CCSuivi/3540723.md).

- [Requirements](../CCSuivi/3540716.md). 

- [Schedule](../CCSuivi/3540705.md). 

- [Gantt chart](../CCSuivi/3540724.md). 

- [Requests](../CCSuivi/3540719.md). 

- [Statistics](../CCSuivi/3540714.md). 

- [Messages](../CCSuivi/3540726.md).

- [Sprints](../CCSuivi/3540730.md).




To create a new view, you can: 

- method 1: click the "+" button to the right of the existing views. 

- method 2: right-click a tab and select "New view" in the context menu. 


You can create multiple views of the same type, but displaying different data. 

**Tip**: By default, the label of the tab describes the type of content (Tasks, Incidents, Schedule, etc.) and is followed by the filter used in that tab (name of the requirement, task manager, developer the incidents are assigned to, etc.). 
If you create a large number of tabs and/or some tabs use the same default name (e.g., two "Incident" panes displaying two different sets of data), you may want to rename the tabs to make them clearer and save space. To rename a tab: 

1. Select the desired view. 

2. Right-click the tab. 

3. In the context menu that appears, select "Customize the title of active view".. 

4. In the window that appears, change the title of the tab and confirm. 




**Global search in the Project Monitoring Center**: 
To start a global search including tasks, incidents and requirements: 

1. Expand ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CC_Suivi_Configuration%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)
 and select "Find items (Ctrl + Shift + F)". 

2. In the window that appears, enter the desired element: 

	- Single word: The text must contain a word beginning with the specified characters.

	- Word enclosed in quotation marks: The text must contain the exact word.

	- Multiple words separated by spaces: The text must contain all the specified words.

	- Word preceded by the "-" sign: The text must not contain the specified word.

	- A word followed by "int:".: The word is searched in the results for the specified contributor. Example: "help contrib:doc"

## Features
<a name="features_ELTTEXTE000380"></a>


### Two use levels
<a name="two_use_levels_ELTPARAGRAPHE000138"></a>

The Project Monitoring Center is used to manage the schedule of a project.

The Project Monitoring Center proposes two levels of use:

- **Use by an administrator** (by default, "ADMIN" is both the username and the password). 
	The administrator defines the projects, the contributors, the tasks to perform. Only the administrator can set administrator rights or delete a task, etc.
	Remark: If you are using an earlier version of the Project Monitoring Center, the username of the administrator may be "SUPERVISOR" (without password).  

- **Use by a contributor**: 
	The contributor can view their schedule, add or move tasks, configure their timetable, change the status of a task, etc.




**Remark**: A contributor can create a project and can be the ***project manager***. In this case, the project manager will be able to define the tasks to be completed, the contributors, etc.
<a name="NOTE3_2"></a>


### Tasks assigned to the administrator
<a name="tasks_assigned_the_administrator_ELTPARAGRAPHE000158"></a>

To manage the creation of a project, the administrator must define: 

- le [project](../CCSuivi/3540702.md).

- the [project contributors](../CCSuivi/3540703.md). 

- [different tasks that will be performed by each contributor](../CCSuivi/3540704.md).

- [spools of requests](../CCSuivi/3540707.md).




Once all these parameters have been defined, the statistics regarding the project monitoring can be displayed (completed elements and elements to perform).

In most cases, projects are configured by the administrator (by default, "ADMIN" is both the username and password) or by the project manager.

### Use
<a name="use_ELTPARAGRAPHE000184"></a>

The Project Monitoring Center can be used by each contributor of a project. It allows the contributor to:

- [See and print their own schedule](../CCSuivi/3540705.md).

- [See their task list for one or more projects](../CCSuivi/3540705.md).

- [Define the current task](../CCSuivi/3540705.md).

- [Define their work details (working days, working hours, etc.)](../CCSuivi/3540706.md).




For more details, see [Schedule and task management](../CCSuivi/3540713.md).

<a name="NOTE3_5"></a>


### "Guest" mode
<a name="guest_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000225"></a>

The Project Monitoring Center proposes a "Guest" mode. This mode allows an unidentified user to view all information in the Project Monitoring Center (task list, schedules, list of projects, etc.).

To start the Project Monitoring Center in "Guest" mode, simply select "Guest" in the login window.

**To allow the "Guest" mode**:

1. Expand ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CC_Suivi_Configuration%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)
 and select "Options".

2. Select "Options reserved for administrators" and then select "Allow guest mode".




**Remark**: Only an administrator can allow the "Guest" mode. The "Guest" mode is not available if the data files of Control Centers are in HFSQL Client/Server format.

### Accessing the data found in the Project Monitoring Center
<a name="accessing_the_data_found_the_project_monitoring_center_ELTPARAGRAPHE000252"></a>

To access the data of the Project Monitoring Center, the **ExternalAccess** component can be included in your project.

This component allows you to view the data of the Control Centers. You can connect to the Control Center database (HFSQL Classic, HFSQL Client/Server, PCSCloud or SCMDrive) to export data about projects, stakeholders, tasks, incidents and requirements in JSON format. 

To import the **CCExternalAccess** component into the current project: 

1. On the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, expand "Import" and select "An External component .. Utility component or example".

2. The list of utility and sample components is displayed. 

3. Select the **CCExternalAccess** component and validate the window. 
	Remark: You can also double-click the component to import it into your project. 

4. The documentation associated with this component gives all the details regarding its operating mode and its features.
