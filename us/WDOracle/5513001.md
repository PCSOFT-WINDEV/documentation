	 For backward compatibility with the earlier versions of Native Oracle Connector (also called Native Oracle Access), the connection can still be configured in WDSQSINS (supplied with Native Oracle Connector).
WDORAINS can also be used to configure some specific options of the Native Connector.

**It is now recommended to use**: 

- [Instant Client](../WDOracle/5513011.md) for the Oracle client side,

- [optional information](../WDLang4/9000124.md) for the settings.

## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000193"></a>
This software is supplied: 

- in 32-bit: WDORAINS.EXE

- in 64-bit: WDORAINS64.EXE




WDORAINS is no longer required since version 8 (and later).

**Reminder**: The setting of the connection performed by WDORAINS must be done once only.

This page presents:

- [the settings of a connection](#NOTE2_1).

- [the definition of connection options](#NOTE3_1).

- [the test of a connection](#NOTE4_1).

## Configuring a connection
<a name="configuring_connection_ELTTEXTE000232"></a>
To configure the connection:

1. Start WDORAINS (32-bit or 64-bit). 

2. In the window that is opened (used to list the existing connections), click the "Add" button to create a new connection. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Parametrage.gif)


3. Specify the connection settings: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Connexion.gif)





- Choose the **name of the data source**. This name will be passed as a parameter to [SQLConnect](../WDLang4/3072005.md) to connect to the database. If the connection was defined in the data model editor of WINDEV or WEBDEV, specify the name of the corresponding connection.

- Add a **description** caption

- Specify a **connection string**. This connection string will allow SQL\*Net to find the database. This value must be supplied by the administrator of the Oracle database. Example of connection string: "OracleServer". In this example, "OracleServer" is the alias to the server defined in SQL\*Net.

- Specify whether the format of the dates must remain **compatible with WinDev 5.5**. 
	Reminder: Between version 5.5 and version 5.5B, the date format was modified. If you check the box, you will restore the date format returned before version 5.5B (see the paragraph below).

- Specify the **format of the dates for the INSERT and UPDATE queries**: this option is used to define the format used by default for the dates in text format. This format will be used if the date format is not specified in the query.

- Specify the **prefetch options** for Oracle 8i or later.
	**Reminder**: Oracle 8i fetches blocks of records ("prefetch"). A large block requires more memory but reduces the network traffic.

	- The number of records corresponds to the number of rows in each block.

	- The maximum memory used corresponds to the size (in bytes) of each block. The "No limit" option allows you to specify no limit.




- Specify whether the **distributed transactions** must be used or not. By default, the distributed transactions are used by the locks and transactions handled by Native Oracle Connector. Check this option if:

	- The distributed transactions are not supported by your server.

	- The distributed transactions are not supported by the versions of client libraries (ORA_02041 error).




- The connection is added to the list once the parameters are validated.

### Remarks
<a name="remarks_ELTPARAGRAPHE000086"></a>

- The information about the setting is stored in the .INI file in the directory of Windows.

- WDSQL is used to check whether the connection to the database is correct.



<a name="NOTE2_3"></a>


### Date format returned by the native Oracle driver (5.5 compatibility)
<a name="date_format_returned_the_native_oracle_driver_55_compatibility_ELTPARAGRAPHE000094"></a>

**In version 5.5**: The date returned by the native Oracle driver when reading a Date item was: DD-MM-YYYY

**In version 5.5B**: The date returned by the native Oracle driver when reading a Date item is now: YYYYMMDD.

**Reasons behind this modification**: Harmonizes the management of dates in WINDEV. Simplifies the assignment of the date read by the Oracle driver in a WINDEV control of DATE type. No specific process is required to convert the date into a format recognized by WINDEV.

**How to keep the former operating mode?**

Configure the date format in WDORAINS: all you have to do is check "Compatibility: return the dates in 'DD-MM-YYYY' format" when describing the database used.

**Reminder**: When writing into a database via the native Oracle driver, we recommend that you use the standard ODBC format {d 'YYYY-MM-DD'} (with a space between d and '). The driver automatically converts the date into the format used by the database.

Example:


```sql
INSERT INTO TABLE(DATE) VALUES ({d '1999-12-25'})
```


**Remark**: Starting with version 12, empty dates correspond to strings filled with zeros. In the earlier versions, the empty dates corresponded to empty strings.

## Options of a connection
<a name="options_connection_ELTTEXTE000268"></a>


### Options for the locks
<a name="options_for_the_locks_ELTPARAGRAPHE000119"></a>

[SQLLock](../WDLang4/3072003.md) expects two parameters:

- the timeout: the timeout during the call to [SQLLock](../WDLang4/3072003.md) can be infinite or not (deadlock).

- the lock mode. For more details, see the documentation about the server.

**Remark**: Some failures may occur if the version of the Oracle server is earlier than the version of the Oracle client (Oracle 7.3 server and Oracle 8 client for example). To avoid these problems, check "Always use a 7.x client".

## Connection test
<a name="connection_test_ELTTEXTE000292"></a>
To run the test of a connection from WDORAINS:

1. Select the connection whose test must be run.

2. Click the "Test" button.

3. Specify the name and password of the user.

4. Click "Test connection". The status report is displayed.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=test.gif)
