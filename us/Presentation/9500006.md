		3 NEW SMART CONTROLS IN WINDEV 27
	

	
		 
	
		WINDEV 27 includes 3 new Smart controls
	

	
		Smart controls save valuable time during the UI creation process, and immediately make you applications more sophisticated. 
3 new Smart controls are introduced in WINDEV 27: 


- Tokenized email address input with autocomplete, 

- Form with non-blocking required input, 

- Drag & Drop rows in a Looper control.


Reminder: Smart controls are provided with their source code, and are therefore completely modifiable and customizable. 
	


<a name="input"></a>
 
	
		New Smart control: Form with non-blocking required input
	

	
		The "Form with non-blocking required input" Smart control is preconfigured with a non-blocking input mode. 
It can be used to create input windows, or to understand the different possibilities of non-blocking required input. 
![Required input fields that are left empty and data that does not match the input mask are highlighted in red. You can navigate between controls](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WD-Champ-Metier-Saisie-Obligatoire-Non-Bloquante.gif)


	


<a name="email"></a>
 
	
		New Smart control: Tokenized email address input
	

	
		The "Tokenized email address input" Smart control shows the list of selected recipients as tokens. 
A list of suggestions appears as you type the addresses of the recipients. 
![Each selected recipient appears as a token](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WD-Champ-Metier-Saisie-Email-Avec-Jetons.gif)


	


 
	
		New Smart control: Drag & Drop in a Looper control
	

	
		The "Drag & Drop in a Looper" Smart control allows the end user to reorder elements in a Looper control via a simple drag & drop. 
A ghost image of the row appears while the row is moved.

<a name="table_control_new_features"></a>

	
		TABLE CONTROL NEW FEATURES
	

	
		 
	
		Table control: Column of type Attribute
	

	
		"Attribute" columns are introduced in the Table control in version 27. 
This type of column can store a value that will not be displayed in the Table control. 
This avoids creating hidden columns to store values needed during the development phase. 
	


 
	
		TableSearchEverywhere: Search in all columns of the Table control
	

	
		The new [TableSearchEverywhere](../WDLang1/1410088362.md) WLanguage function searches for a string in the whole Table control. 
It is no longer necessary to search column by column. 
	


 
	
		StoredValue property: Binding source
	

	
		The [StoredValue](../Proprietes/2510127.md) property is now available for Table controls populated by data binding. 
This property allows you to identify the data source of the current row in the Table control. 
	



	


<a name="new_features_of_controls"></a>

	
		NEW FEATURES FOR CONTROLS
	

	
		 
	
		Pivot Table control: Remember last criteria selected
	

	
		In version 27, the selected criteria are saved for the next time the user opens the control: end users no longer have to specify the criteria each time. 
	


 
	
		Open windows with tabs more quickly
	

	
		Your applications contain windows with tabs? 
These windows open more quickly in version 27. 
	


 
	
		Calendar control: Display the week number
	

	
		The Calendar control in version 27 allows you to display the week number. 

![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WD%20Calendrier%20-%20Affichage%20semaine.jpg)


	


 
	
		Scrollbars: New "Windows 11" style available
	

	
		This style is available for Windows 10 and 11. 
Version 27 has a new scrollbar style: the "Windows 11" mode. 
In this mode, the scrollbar appears as a thin line when the cursor is away from it. 
When hovered over, it "regains" its usual width. 
	


 
	
		Internal window: Style
	

	
		In version 27, you can define a style for an Internal Window control.
	


 
	
		Internal Window and Layout control: Apply skin template
	

	
		In version 27, you can apply skin templates to Internal Windows and Layout controls at runtime. 
This allows you to change the appearance of a running application, for example to switch to dark theme. 
	


 
	
		HTML control: Easier debugging
	

	
		An HTML Editor or HTML Display control can contain JavaScript code. 
In version 27, you can activate the Chrome debugger and attach it to the HTML control in order to debug the JavaScript code. 

For more details, see the help about [HTMLEnableDebugger](../WDLang5/1410087849.md).
	


 
	
		Text: Font size units, character and line spacing
	

	
		There are new available settings for the text present in controls (whether it is the label of the control, text entered or simply displayed). 
This makes it easy to fine-tune the text: 

- new and more precise line spacing/size units are introduced (pixel, point).

- you can use decimal values to fine-tune the settings.

- you can adjust character spacing.

- you can adjust line spacing.

- ... 



	


 
	
		Hide window title
	

	
		
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WD%20-%20Masquage%20titre%20fen.jpg)

By default, the window title is displayed in the window's title bar. 
In version 27, you can hide the window title. 
This can be useful when you use a custom title bar, e.g. if you reduce its height. 
Unlike a title that is simply deleted, the window title will always be known to Windows, and displayed in the taskbar, for example. 
	


 
	
		Button hover and focus
	

	
		5-state buttons have a "Hover" state and a "Focus" state. In version 27, you can choose which of these 2 states will be used when the user hovers over the control that has focus. 
	


 
	
		Looper: Variable break heights
	

	
		Now you can set different break heights in the same Looper control. 

This makes Looper controls more elegant and readable.

		YOUR APPLICATIONS IN WINDOWS 11
	

	
		 
	
		Windows with light theme, dark theme and Windows-11 style
	

	
		In WINDEV 27, you can create windows using the design language of Windows 11. 
The application can use a light or dark theme. 
	


 
	
		Publish your applications to the Microsoft store
	

	
		The Microsoft Store allows you to publish free or paid applications. 
Applications developed with WINDEV 27 can be distributed through the Microsoft Store for Windows 11. 
	


 
	
		Windows 11 design language: What changes for UIs
	

	
		Windows 11 offers a new type of UI: rounded window corners, controls spaced further apart, scrollbars and menus with a different appearance... 
The "maximize" button invokes a popup menu... 
The following new features explore some of these changes. 
	


 
	
		Windows
	

	
		The 2 main changes for windows in Windows 11 are:

- rounded corners.

- the Snap Layouts menu: the Maximize button invokes a menu with a window layout.


In Windows 11, WINDEV application windows have rounded corners by default. 

![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WD-Windows11-coins-arrondis.png)

You can avoid displaying these rounded corners by using the clipping feature available in WINDEV. 
The windows are compatible with the new Snap Layouts menu and its gestures. 

![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WD-Windows11-snap.png)

	


 
	
		Margins and spacing
	

	
		In Windows 11, there are wider margins between the window border and the content, and controls are further apart. 
When you use Windows 11 skin templates, your applications adopt the new margin and spacing standards. 
	


 
	
		Windows 11 menu
	

	
		Menus also change in Windows 11. 
Just like with controls, spacing has been increased: this takes up more space, but increases readability and makes apps more touchscreen-friendly. 
On the visual side, a shadow and an opening animation have been implemented. 
The most note-worthy feature is an optional row at the top with small icons for the most common actions. 


![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WD-Windows11-menu-contextuel.gif)


WINDEV 27 allows you to create this type of menu. 
	


 
	
		Scrollbars
	

	
		In Windows 11, scrollbars use 2 different aspects depending on whether or not they are in use. 
When not in use, the scrollbar has a light appearance. 
When hovered over, all its details are shown: the scrollbar widens and the up and down arrows appear. 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WD-WIN11-ascenseurs-fins.png)
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WD-WIN11-ascenseurs-larges.png)


	


 
	
		New icons
	

	
		Icons have also changed in Windows 11. 
The image catalog provided in WINDEV 27 includes a new set of icons with the Windows 11 design language.

		SKIN TEMPLATES
	

	
		 
	
		2 new skin templates for WINDEV
	

	
		The Mika and Mika Dark skin templates are introduced in version 27. 
This allows for new customization possibilities. 
	



	


<a name="help_of_your_applications"></a>

	
		HELP OF YOUR APPLICATIONS
	

	
		 
	
		Incorporate links to videos in the help
	

	
		The help in your applications can now include links to videos. 
The following are supported: 

- links to videos on YouTube 
	

- links to MP4 or WebM video addresses. HTML help pages can play the video directly in the page. 


PDF help pages display a clickable thumbnail to open the video in the default browser. 
	



	


<a name="windev_install_via_pcscloud"></a>

	
		WINDEV INSTALL VIA PCSCLOUD
	

	
		 
	
		Install via PCSCloud: Domain name in the link
	

	
		You can store the setup files of your WINDEV applications in the cloud, using PCSCloud. 
The default domain name (PCSCloud.net) can be replaced with your own domain name, such as your company's website, for example. 
	


 
	
		Install via PCSCloud: HTTPS by default
	

	
		As previously mentioned, you can store the setup files of your applications in the cloud, using PCSCloud. 
In that case, you share a link with the users so that they can install the application. 
In version 27, HTTPS is used by default, which improves security. 
	


 
	
		Your Private Store in PCSCloud
	

	
		In version 27, you can allow users to install your applications from a Private Store. 
This Store can be hosted in PCSCloud.net: you don't have to manage an additional infrastructure. 
An all-in-one solution is available.
	



	


<a name="windev_private_store
users_install_your_windev_applications_from_your_own_store"></a>

	
		WINDEV PRIVATE STORE: USERS INSTALL YOUR WINDEV APPLICATIONS FROM YOUR OWN STORE
	

	
		 
	
		Easily distribute your software within an organization
	

	
		Version 27 includes a Private Store. This store allows you to group applications used within an organization. 
The store can be accessed from within the organization only, or be publicly accessible . 
A portal with optional authentication allows authorized users to install applications. 
This standardizes and simplifies app distribution within an organization. 
	


 
	
		Easy implementation with existing infrastructure.
	

	
		The Store is provided as standard in version 27. 
Simply install it on a company server, or in the cloud (PCSCloud.net for example). 
In WINDEV, when creating the installation for the app, select "Private Store". 
The installation is deployed to the Store server either automatically at the end of the installation generation, or by manually uploading it to the server. 
	


 
	
		Public application, private application
	

	
		A store can contain applications accessible both with and without authentication. 
By accessing the server with login credentials, users see only the applications they are allowed to install. 
This makes it possible to keep certain applications "private" and limit their distribution.
	


 
	
		How does it work for the users?
	

	
		You can provide end users with one of the following: 


- the direct link to the application, 

- the link to your Store. 
	If authentication is required, it can be implemented: 
	

- via the User Groupware 

- via oAuth (Microsoft, Google, Facebook, etc.). 


The application is automatically installed on the device: your helpdesk is not burdened with requests, which reduces operating costs. 
	


 
	
		Automatic update
	

	
		When a new version of an application is installed on the Store, users will automatically be prompted to update the application next time they open it.
	


 
	
		Version history on the server
	

	
		The version history of each application is kept on the server, which makes it possible to go back to a previous version if necessary.
	



	


<a name="environment"></a>

	
		ENVIRONMENT
	

	
		 
	
		Common new features
	

	
		WINDEV's environment benefits from the common new features (see [common new features of the environment](../Presentation/9500001.md)). 
Some of the most notable features are the new help and the new alignment options. 
	


 
	
		Update templates: 5X faster
	

	
		In version 27, updating templates in large projects is much faster. 
In some cases, up to 5 times faster!. 
	


 
	
		Real-time audit detects obsolete technology
	

	
		The environment detects and notifies you if there are obsolete technologies in your code, and suggests alternatives. 
These obsolete technologies can slow down the editor and your applications, and even create security risks. 

	


 
	
		Miscellaneous
	

	
		The quick selection window (Ctrl+E) now includes a larger and more readable window thumbnail.
	



	


<a name="window_editor"></a>

	
		WINDOW EDITOR
	

	
		 
	
		Style sheet, location of resources
	

	
		Resources used by style sheets, such as images, are often stored in a directory or subdirectory of the style sheet. 
Version 27 stores access paths as relative and no longer absolute paths: it is thus easier to copy styles.
	



	


<a name="rad"></a>

	
		RAD
	

	
		 
	
		RAD: Generate code with prefix syntax
	

	
		The RAD methodology allows you to generate full applications with a few clicks. 
In version 27 you can specify that the generated code must use prefix syntax.
	



	


<a name="aaf_automatic_application_features"></a>

	
		AAF: AUTOMATIC APPLICATION FEATURES
	

	
		 
	
		Adapt the column width to the content via the context menu
	

	
		An Automatic Application Feature allows users to adapt the column width to the content: in Microsoft Excel, for example, this is the equivalent of double-clicking the right border of the column header. 
End users can now find this AAF in the context menu of Table controls. 
![Context menu with the most common AAFs](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WD%20-%20FAA%20largeur%20colonne.gif)


	


 
	
		Unlock columns
	

	
		An application developer can decide to lock a column. In that case, a padlock appears in the column header. 
A new AAF allows users to unlock this column. 
This AAF can be disabled by programming. 
	



	


<a name="java"></a>

	
		JAVA
	

	
		 
	
		Aggregation functions
	

	
		In version 27, the [Reduce](../WDLang1/1000024744.md) , [Map](../WDLang1/1000024734.md) and [Filter](../WDLang1/1000024845.md) functions are available in Java. 
	


 
	
		Exception: Customize error handling processes
	

	
		In version 27, the Exception and Error functions have been improved and now include many new functions to customize the behavior of the application if an exception or WLanguage error is encountered in your program. 
	


 
	
		23 new Java functions
	

	
		WLanguage offers 23 new functions for Java

		WLANGUAGE
	

	
		 
	
		Common new features
	

	
		The language is the cornerstone of the development. 
In version 27, WLanguage in WINDEV is further enriched. 
It benefits from common new features and many useful improvements: AI object detection, named parameters of the Open function, new syntax, new compilation directives,... 
	


 
	
		Native Scan functions (better than Twain)
	

	
		Many scanners no longer provide a Twain interface to communicate with the scanner through programming. 
WINDEV and WEBDEV Server 27 introduce a new type and new WLanguage functions to natively manage scanners through programming. 
The Scanner type defines the scanner to be used. You can define multiple [Scanner](../WDLang6/1410087808.md) variables in a program to use different scanners in parallel. 
[ScanSelect](../WDLang6/1410087835.md), a new WLanguage function, opens the default scanner selection window. 
The scan can be started through programming or by opening the specific driver settings window.


```wl
MyScanner is Scanner = ScanSelect()
// Scan all the pages in the feeder to a PDF file
MyScanner.ToPDF("File.PDF")
```

		Awesome notifications in Windows (10 & 11)
	

	
		A notification is a small window that appears at the bottom right of the screen, and that can be viewed at any time in the Windows notification area. 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WD%20-%20Notif%20Windows%2011.gif)
This type of window has been standardized by Windows (using XML). 
In version 27, you can easily create beautiful notifications to be displayed in Windows 10 and 11. 
A notification can contain:

- images 

- text 

- edit controls 

- buttons 

- combo boxes. 
	To create these notifications, simply use the new [sysNotification](../WDLang1/1410087893.md), [sysNotificationButton](../WDLang1/1410087947.md) and [sysNotificationInput](../WDLang1/1410088024.md) WLanguage types. 
	You set a time, an alarm or a reminder, ... 
	These notifications are clickable. 
	You can still create the XML document required to display and manage the notification. 




For more details, see: 

- [Interactive notifications](../WDLang1/1410088027.md).

- [Interactive notification management functions](../WDLang1/1410088026.md).



	


 
	
		OpenDocumentAsynchronous: Open multiple documents simultaneously
	

	
		Opening documents asynchronously allows you to open one or multiple documents without blocking the application. 
End users can continue to use the application without having to close the document(s). 


For more details, see the help about [OpenDocumentAsynchronous](../WDLang1/1410088182.md).
	


 
	
		Modernized UI for self-extracting executables
	

	
		WINDEV has always allowed developers to create self-extracting executables. 
In version 27, the progress bar displayed during the extraction gets a welcome facelift... 

	


 
	
		RESTSend : New syntax
	

	
		To make writing cross-platform code easier, the syntax of the [RESTSend](../WDLang3/1000021476.md) function with callbacks is now the same in WINDEV and WEBDEV.
	


 
	
		Client WebSockets
	

	
		WebSocketXXX functions are available in WINDEV. 
This allows your applications to easily communicate with a WebSocket server, created with WEBDEV or with another development environment
	


 
	
		Sign executables using SHA-256
	

	
		Some certificate providers require the use of SHA-256. 
The [CertificateSignExecutable](../WDLang1/1000020560.md) WLanguage function accepts certificates that only use SHA-256.
	


 
	
		geogetaddress
	

	
		In version 27, the [geoGetAddress](../WDLang3/1000019797.md) function is available in WINDEV. 
This function returns the address of a (known) location passed as parameter.
