- Non-movable controls are ignored. 



	


 
	
		Elements currently edited: they can be undocked (out of the environment)
	

	
		Elements in edit mode can be undocked and positioned outside the environment. 
When the element is moved back into the environment, the areas where it can be re-docked are highlighted. 
In version 27, holding down the Ctrl key allows you to freely position this element. 
Make sure you try this practical feature! 
	


 
	
		Image catalog: now with color!
	

	
		Your favorite environment comes with a rich catalog of images and icons: tens of thousands of elements available at no extra cost! 
Many images and icons come in black & white. 
In version 27, a new option allows you to apply color to these elements.
	


 
	
		Editor ribbon: open the right directory with a single click
	

	
		Very often, developers need to open a file explorer directly on the project directory or the EXE (or generation) directory of the current configuration. 
The "Folder" button in the ribbon allows you to do so with a single click! 
	


 
	
		Move controls in increments using the keyboard
	

	
		You can move a control by a precise number of pixels, using the status bar in the environment: it is now possible to type "+10" or "-5" to move the control along the X or Y-axis.

In agile development, a project is divided into a set of sprints. 
The Project Monitoring Center now integrates this method. 
A sprint has a start and end date, and can contain requirements, tasks and incidents. 
The different sprints are clearly represented. 
A schedule with a Gantt chart layout shows the selected sprints. 
	


 
	
		Fix tracking: issues fixed by a developer between 2 dates
	

	
		New statistic available: the number of tickets fixed by a developer between 2 dates. 
A new chart shows the trend of new and fixed issues. 
Of course, you can directly open each ticket from this list. 
	


 
	
		Messages related to a requirement/incident
	

	
		A requirement can be created from a message in the integrated messaging system. 
You can now follow and continue the discussion thread related to that requirement/incident. 
	


 
	
		Evolution of tags
	

	
		Tags are used to classify incidents. 
One or more tags can be associated with a ticket: "Minor bug", "Regression", "UI", ... 
Tickets that don't have any tags are identified as "No tag", which makes it possible to find and classify them. 
	


 
	
		Miscellaneous
	

	
		

- New incident management options have been introduced (ability to specify workarounds, multiple screenshots, new incident states, etc.) 
	

- The window interface is more intuitive.

		PROJECTS SLOWED DOWN BY DEPRECATED FEATURES - DETECT AND FIX THEM IN THE ENVIRONMENT
	

	
		 
	
		Potential improvements
	

	
		In version 27, when the automatic UI audit detects a control or parameter that can be improved, an icon appears next to that element. By clicking the icon, you can view the details of the change to be made. 
	


 
	
		The real-time audit detects deprecated features used in your projects
	

	
		The lifecycle of some projects span several years: this is quite common 
Often, projects use features that date from the time the project was created (technologies that are now outdated or that have been replaced by more secure alternatives), options that have become useless, inefficient. Sometimes, it is necessary to enable more recent options. 
Version 27 indicates the deprecated technology or the new features and proposes the technology to be used. 
This may include, for example: 

- an HTML control still in IE6 mode (which prevents modern content from being displayed correctly) 

- a Chart or Shape control for which anti-aliasing has not been enabled 

- a Camera control in an old version 

- any control for which a new useful option is available but has not been enabled 

- a Combo Box control that can be made resizable or set to auto-size 

- enable autocomplete for controls with a file path input mask 

- ... 




Version 27 also notifies you about more general problems: 

- a background image with transparency but without clipping (which consumes resources unnecessarily) 

- an Internal Window control that points to an Internal Window not found in the project 

- Binding to an non-existent item or variable 

- Control not compatible with the current configuration 

- Control too small to be touchscreen-friendly 

- Conflicting anchors 

- Multiple controls with the same logical name. 

- 2 OK or Cancel buttons in a window 

- ... 



	


 
	
		Better performance in the editor
	

	
		Using controls with deprecated features can have a negative impact on the performance of your editors, slow down execution, generation, template updates, etc, ... 
It is therefore a good idea to replace these old features with up-to-date alternatives. 
	


 
	
		Better performance at runtime
	

	
		Old features slow down execution. 
A simple way to increase the speed of your applications is to replace these outdated features. 
	


 
	
		Lighter and less memory-intensive pages
	

	
		In WEBDEV in particular, using controls with outdated features or parameters can result in larger and more memory-intensive pages. 
Updating your controls will significantly optimize size and memory consumption! 
	



	


<a name="continous_integration_software_factory"></a>

	
		CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION SOFTWARE FACTORY
	

	
		 
	
		Environment variables: for sharing parameters
	

	
		Environment variables have been introduced in the Software Factory. 
An environment variable is a value that can be used in the configuration of action plans: a major version number, for example. 
This avoids having to modify all action plans that use that value. 
	


 
	
		Set a computer to restart automatically
	

	
		It may be necessary to reboot a computer at regular intervals, for example every 2 days: reset Windows memory, ... 
In version 27, this can be scheduled in the Software Factory administrator. 
The robot will complete the current action plan before restarting the computer. 
	


 
	
		Receive notifications according to the runtime mode
	

	
		In Continuous Integration, success notifications can quickly clutter up your messaging system... 
In version 27, you can select the type of messages you want to receive, for example only error messages. 
	


 
	
		Deployment on PCSCLOUD.NET
	

	
		In version 27, a new action has been added to the action plan editor: Automatic deployment on the PCSCloud.net server. 
You can define multiple PCSCloud deployment profiles.

		Secure mode configuration: all actions blocked by default
	

	
		In version 27, the User Groupware allows you to create profiles where all actions are blocked by default. 
The administrator will have to authorize each action manually... 
No more risk of unblocking a sensitive functionality by accident.
	


 
	
		Get the details of the logged in user

		You can view the GIT history of an element directly in the environment. 
No need to use a different tool! 
	


 
	
		Git: controls: reduce conflicts by reorganizing the source object
	

	
		A WINDEV "Control" is a remarkably powerful and useful object. 
In version 27, the internal format of the control has segmented properties, which reduces conflicts resulting from concurrent modifications of different elements: it is less likely that multiple developers try to modify the same segment. 
	


 
	
		Git: compare changes in the history

		<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WX-GDS-Volet%20etat%20des%20elements.gif)
In version 27, the SCM includes a new pane that shows which elements have been checked out by the team, and which developer has checked out each element, all in real time. 
This provides an overview of the work in progress at any given time... 
This pane also allows you to send a message to the developer who checked out the element.
	


 
	
		SCM: view revisions in the history of an element
	

	
		<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=GDS_Revisions.gif)
The history window of an element displays the revisions. 
In version 27, this window also displays the details of this revision: all the elements involved in the revision. 
3 actions are available by clicking on an element: 

- view the history

- view the changes in this revision 

- save the element to disk.

In version 27, check-in requests sent to a developer appear directly in their environment! 
If the environment is closed, the message is kept on hold and will be displayed when it is opened again. 
	


 
	
		SCM: "Checked out by" notification when opening an element
	

	
		<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WX-GDS-Panneau%20Element%20extrait.jpg)


In version 27, when you open an element, a notification appears immediately if another developer has already checked out that element. 
You won't have to find out later on when you try to make changes... 
	


 
	
		SCM: non-blocking history
	

	
		You can view the history of an element without blocking the environment. 
	


 
	
		SCM: branches: improved merge
	

	
		The methods for renaming project elements and managing relations between controls during a merge operation have been reviewed and improved. 
In earlier versions, some changes had to be propagated manually between branches. Version 27 automatically propagates changes made to the following elements: 

- Radio Button and Check Box options 

- Table control columns 

- Looper attributes 

- Tab panes

- order changes 

- relations between controls (controls contained in other controls) 

- ... 
	You will be notified if a manual action is required. 



	


 
	
		SCM: miscellaneous
	

	
		

- Easier access to multiple SCM repositories 

- Branch creation: the error report (if any) is displayed only after the branch has been created. Minor errors no longer interrupt the branch creation process 

- Branch creation: shared files between projects are always managed

		Multilingual messages: new technology
	

	
		The current technology for managing multilingual strings is kept for compatibility. 
A new technology has been implemented in version 27 in order to make things easier. 
It gets rid of the numbering used for multilingual strings, along with its constraints. 
	


 
	
		AI now powers code completion
	

	
		Code completion evolves in version 27. 
The three most relevant suggestions appear at the top of the list. 
These suggestions are the result of an AI learning process fed by a large number of projects. 
The input history is also used to select these suggestions. 
For example, if an int variable is declared, it will appear as a suggestion in the following call to a function that uses an integer. 
Another example: after a line of code containing the [HReadFirst](../WDLang4/3044051.md) function, HReadNext will appear in the suggestions as soon as you type "h"... 
You will certainly enjoy this new code completion feature. 
	


 
	
		Completion on advanced types
	

	
		The code editor offers code completion for all the arrays in advanced types. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WD%20Assistance%20type%20avanc%E9.gif)


	


 
	
		3 new code wizards
	

	
		Code wizards ask questions to generate the code or set the appropriate parameters. 
3 new code wizards are introduced in version 27: 

- define the parameters of [HTTPSend](../WDLang3/1000021183.md) and [RESTSend](../WDLang3/1000021476.md)

- [httpRequest](../WDLang3/1000021158.md) type initialization

		The new feature that allows you to identify controls that contain code is essential in the report editor! 
The code can be in different processes of the report. 
Version 27 makes it easy to resume development on a report created years before or created by another developer. 
	


 
	
		Gantt report: even more details
	

	
		Many users print Gantt charts. 
Version 27 provides additional settings: 

- you can display week numbers 

- you can display an indication of the current day. 



	


 
	
		Report editor: blur or redact an area in a preview

<a name="ai"></a>

	
		AI: AUTOMATIC DETECTION OF PEOPLE AND OBJECTS IN IMAGES
	

	
		 
	
		Artificial Intelligence analyzes photos and images
	

	
		Version 27 features an artificial intelligence engine to detect objects in images. 
The new [AIDetect](../WDLang6/1410087942.md) and [AIDetectModel](../WDLang6/1410087982.md), functions, as well as the [aiImageResult](../WDLang6/1410087965.md), and [aiNeuralNetworkModel](../WDLang6/1410088095.md), WLanguage types, allow for easy programming. 
	


 
	
		82 default objects + your own objects
	

	
		Note: we are not objects, sure, but the concept of "object" also includes living beings. 
82 objects are included as standard: face, human being, dog, cat, table, car, license plate, ... 
You can define other objects to be detected. In this case, you will need to provide the object recognition model. 
	


 
	
		Programming
	

	
		There are 3 common uses for the standard list of objects: 

- detect all objects in the image 

- detect a given object in the image: all dogs, all cars, all license plates... 

- detect a given list of objects. 


[AIDetect](../WDLang6/1410087942.md) returns an array of [aiImageResult](../WDLang6/1410087965.md) containing the type of object, the coordinates of the polygon that contains the object and the confidence level. 
On the other hand, code that uses custom models returns a matrix that depends on the provided model. 
	


 
	
		Usage example
	

	
		There are many examples of the use of automatic object detection: 


- Blur an object automatically: face, license plate... 

- Detect a face in a profile picture 

- Crop a face 

- Count vegetables automatically 

- Classify images 

- Count 

- ... 



	



	


<a name="wlanguage"></a>

	
		WLANGUAGE
	

	
		 
	
		Multithreaded compilation: even faster
	

	
		The multithreaded compilation mode introduced in the previous version significantly improved compilation times. 
Version 27 is even faster, as it uses all available cores by default. 
	


 
	
		Compilation and generation, select number of cores
	

	
		As presented above, in version 27, multithreaded compilation uses all available processor cores by default. 
You can specify the number of cores to be used, which allows you to tune performance, handle special cases, and allow other processes to continue to run at reasonable speed. 
	


 
	
		"open" functions: optional (named) parameters
	

	
		The Open WLanguage function uses a variable number of parameters. 
To avoid entering all the parameters, it is now possible to name the parameters and enter only those that are used. 
	


 
	
		New /= and \*= operators
	

	
		The /= and \*= operators are introduced in this version. 
Just like the += and -= operators, they simplify source code. 
	


 
	
		Comments in the middle of a line of code: between /\* and #STARSTAR# indicates the beginning of the comment, and \*/ indicates the end of the comment, which can span over multiple lines. 
This syntax also allows you to comment out a section of code in the middle of a line! 
 Example: 
```wl
IF Customer. Email <> "" /* _et_ customer.VIP = true */ THEN
```

	


 
	
		Multiline strings defined by quotation marks " "
	

	
		Version 27 supports the " (quote) syntax, to make entering multiline strings easier.
	


 
	
		Lambda calls, Getter and Setter: optimizations
	

	
		In version 27, lambda calls, property getters and setters are faster. 

	


 
	
		N++ and ++N, N-- and --N
	

	
		You already know the difference between the ++ operators placed before or after the variable. 
N++ increments the value after evaluating the expression, whereas ++N does it before. 
That changes everything! 
In version 27, both syntaxes are available: ++ and -- 
	


 
	
		Regular expressions: find and replace
	

	
		Regular expressions are a very powerful concept, and allow for very concise code. 
In version 27, regular expressions are even more powerful. 
You can search for and even replace a string in another string, using a regular expression! 
All in one line of code. 
Two new WLanguage functions are also introduced: RegexSearch and [RegexReplace](../WDLang1/1000026275.md). 
	


 
	
		Luhn algorithm: verify or calculate the check digit
	

	
		The Luhn algorithm is used to calculate the check digit of a credit card number, and to detect false numbers. 
Two WLanguage functions are introduced in version 27 to calculate and verify this check digit: [LuhnCalculate](../WDLang1/1410087276.md) and [LuhnCheck](../WDLang1/1410087277.md). 
	


 
	
		Password security: PBKDF2 hashing
	

	
		PBKDF2 is a very powerful hashing algorithm. 
Its main purpose is to securely hash data, especially passwords. 
This type of hashing is also used to obtain a series of derived keys (passwords) from a password. 
The [HashString](../WDLang1/1000007111.md) and [HashFile](../WDLang1/1000007112.md) now accept the new PBKDF2 constant, which expects the salt, number of iterations and key size as parameters-. 
	


 
	
		Handling html documents through programming: useful improvements
	

	
		The WLanguage functions used to handle HTML documents are already very powerful. 
Version 27 includes new properties that further simplify code: 


- The **Index** property is used to get the index of an HTML node.

- The **Parent** property gets the parent of a node 


The new HTML WLanguage functions are useful as well: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [HTMLInsertBefore](../WDLang5/1410087609.md) | [HTMLInsertAfter](../WDLang5/1410087610.md) |
| [HTMLWrap](../WDLang5/1410087611.md) | [HTMLWrapAllChildren](../WDLang5/1410087612.md) |
| [HTMLUnwrapAllChildren](../WDLang5/1410087613.md) | [HTMLRemove](../WDLang5/1410087614.md) |
| [HTMLInsertFirstChild](../WDLang5/1410087615.md) | [HTMLInsertLastChild](../WDLang5/1410087616.md) |
| [HTMLRemoveChild](../WDLang5/1410087617.md) | [HTMLModifyAttribute](../WDLang5/1410087618.md) |
| [HTMLModifyAttribute](../WDLang5/1410087618.md) | [HTMLRemoveAttribute](../WDLang5/1410087619.md) |



	


 
	
		INIWrite no longer needs NumToString
	

	
		The [INIWrite](../WDLang1/3013039.md) function only accepted strings as parameters. 
Starting with version 27, [INIWrite](../WDLang1/3013039.md) accepts parameters of type int, real, boolean, etc.
	


 
	
		Prefix syntax not used: ability to display a programming standard error
	

	
		When the programming standard of a project defines the use of prefix syntax (control.function) as mandatory, a programming standard error can be generated at compilation time. 
	


 
	
		New compilation directive
	

	
		A new compilation directive allows you to define a specific mode (32-bit or 64-bit) for the compilation phase. 
This is especially useful when using external APIs that only work in one mode, either 32-bit or 64-bit. 
	


 
	
		Blurring an area of an image
	

	
		The new [dBlur](../WDLang1/1410088153.md) WLanguage function blurs a rectangle defined by coordinates passed as parameters. 
A Gaussian blur is applied. 
The radius of the blur is passed as parameter. 
	


 
	
		Zip compression functions: clearer error messages
	

	
		The error messages from Zip functions are more precise and allow a quicker understanding of the problems that may occur. 
	


 
	
		EncryptStandard function: pass the initialization vector as parameter
	

	
		The [EncryptStandard](../WDLang1/1000021293.md) WLanguage function manages all the encryption parameters automatically. 
In some cases, the encryption initialization vector is imposed by the device the application communicates with. 
Now you can pass this initialization vector to the function as a parameter . 
	


 
	
		Miscellaneous
	

	
		

- The API description type now supports 1 and 2-byte integers, both signed and unsigned. 

- It is now possible to edit an image's Exif data

		WEBSERVICES
	

	
		 
	
		Webservice: force HTTP2
	

	
		There are 2 HTTP standards: http1 and http2. 
When calling a server, the client and server "negotiate" to agree on the protocol version to use. 
However, some servers use only one standard: http2. 
Version 27 allows you to force the use of http2. 
	


 
	
		Soap header: add XML nodes
	

	
		You can add a node to a SOAP web service header with the new [SOAPAddHeader](../WDLang3/3069001.md) function. 
	


 
	
		HTTP delete request
	

	
		In some cases, Delete HTTP requests require passing data. 
In version 27, you can pass this data.

		In version 27, the new [JSONToXML](../WDLang5/1410087330.md) and [XMLToJSON](../WDLang5/1410087331.md) WLanguage functions allow you to automatically convert one format to the other. 

```wl
DocJSON is JSON = fLoadText(JSONFile)
DocXML is xmlDocument
DocXML = JSONToXML(DocJSON)
```
[JSONXMLConverter](../WDLang5/1410087323.md), a new WLanguage type, opens new options to configure and customize the conversion process: conversion of XML attributes, namespaces, empty tags...

		Faster access to structure members and members of type array: 30% faster
	

	
		When aggregating arrays (members of type object), you can access structure members 30% faster in version 27. 
The same applies to members containing arrays of objects. 
This is a major advantage in projects where Object Oriented Programming is mainly used. 
	


 
	
		Access properties faster
	

	
		In version 27, the access to properties is faster. An improvement of over 20% was observed. 
	


 
	
		Polymorphic "FOR EACH"
	

	
		You can loop through an array of objects that contains derived classes, taking into account only the objects of a given class: it's a polymorphic FOR EACH statement. 


```wl
arrVehicles is array of CVehicle
//Calculate total number of packages shipped
TotalPackagesShipped is int
FOR EACH clTruck OF TYPE Truck OF arrVehicles
TotalPackagesShipped += clTruck.PackagesShipped
END
```

	


 
	
		Code the equality and comparison operators more easily
	

	
		Coding the and &lt; and &gt; operators is easier in version 27. 
New compilation directives allow you to declare the members to be compared as well as the order of comparison. 


```wl
GLOBAL PROCEDURE CompareVehicle(Car1, Car2)
<comparison>
Compare(Engine)
CompareDescendingOrder(Consumption)
CompareAscendingOrder(Range)
```

	


 
	
		OOP: miscellaneous
	

	
		

- You can set the default comparison operator. 
	

- The &lt;Useful&gt; and &lt;ForceDestructor&gt; attributes can now be used with classes.

		Python: Native Python calls in WLanguage
	

	
		You can now call Python code natively from WLanguage, just like .Net assemblies, SOAP web services, etc, ... 
Importing the .py file into the environment allows the code editor to automatically recognize all the functions of the .py script. 
Each function in the script is then considered as a native WLanguage function. 
The Python engine is initialized using the [PythonInitialize](../WDLang6/1410088100.md) function. 


```wl
// == WLanguage code ==
sResult is string
sResult = solver("3x**2-2x+5")
```

```txt
// == Python code ==
from sympy.solvers import solve
from sympy import sympify
def solver(equation):
return str(solve(sympify(equation)))[2:-1]

		HFSQL DATABASE
	

	
		 
	
		Faster and more memory-efficient queries
	

	
		HFSQL 27 improves the performance of different types of queries. 
"Full scan" queries containing dates are 30% faster. 
Queries with SQL "TOP", "BOTTOM" or "TOP/BOTTOM" clauses use much less memory.

		Need to nest transactions? 
You can use savepoints to roll back to an intermediate point of the transaction. 
The transaction will be divided into smaller parts. 
During the transaction, the [HTransactionSavepoint](../WDLang4/1410087841.md) WLanguage function allows you to define and name a savepoint. 
To undo the part of the transaction after this point, simply use [HTransactionRollbackToSavepoint](../WDLang4/1410087842.md). 
You can set multiple savepoints in the same transaction. 
	


 
	
		New "file alias" type to simplify programming
	

	
		Aliases have always been available in HFSQL. 
An alias allows you to perform one or more iterations on a file already in use without affecting the current iteration(s). 
The use of aliases is simplified in version 27. 
Simply write: 

```wl
Customers2 is alias of Customers
```

and that's all there is to it! 

	


 
	
		HExportJSON
	

	
		In version 27, [HExportJSON](../WDLang4/1000021964.md) can also be used to export the data file or query to a JSON type in WLanguage, no longer only to a file on disk.

		Server replication: limit repetitive notifications
	

	
		When the connection to the server cannot be established, a message is generated. 
The number of server connection error notifications is limited so as not clutter up your inbox with the same message. 
	


 
	
		Install assisted universal replication on your own application server, in Windows and Linux

This server can run on Windows or Linux. 
	


 
	
		Advanced Encryption: AES-192 and AES-256
	

	
		The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) requires at least AES-192 for top secret information. 
HFSQL 27 supports both AES-192 and AES-256.

<a name="password_security"></a>

	
		PASSWORD SECURITY: NEW "PASSWORD" ITEM. PASSWORDS ARE NOT STORED, BUT YOUR APP CAN CHECK THEM
	

	
		 
	
		Security: "password" item without stored password (hashed/salted password)
	

	
		
In version 27, a new advanced type of HFSQL item is introduced: the Password advanced type. 
This new type of item does not store the actual password. 
The password entered by the end user won't be stored as is. 
This means there are no chances of hacking into the database to obtain this password. 
How is this possible? 
Before being stored, the password will be both salted and hashed. 
Salting consists in adding a random string to the password. If two users enter the same password, their salted passwords will be different. 
This salted password will then be hashed, making it unidentifiable. 
The result of these irreversible operations is stored in the database, instead of the original password. 
Attackers cannot cannot reverse engineer the password from the result of these operations, but you can still check if a password matches the original one. The password cannot be read, but it can be compared. 
You can configure the type of hash, result length and number of iterations. 
With this new type of item, hackers can no longer steal passwords by accessing the data file. 
	


 
	
		How to determine if a password is valid
	

	
		To determine if a password is valid, simply compare the string entered and the content of the Password item (using the = operator). 
Since WLanguage is a 5GL, it recognizes the types of the operators and automatically performs the necessary operations. No special programming required! 
All related WLanguage functions automatically adapt to this particular type of item. 
It supports the Null value and cannot be defined as index in the data file. 
The LastCheckDate property returns the date the password was last written to the data file.

| SAVEPOINT | Defines and names a new savepoint within the current transaction. |


	


 
	
		Sql syntax: [% %] to replace a variable with its value
	

	
		SQL queries written in the code accept a new, useful syntax: [% variable_name %]. 
At runtime, the variable name between "%" characters will be replaced with the value of this variable. 
This avoids having to declare and assign a value to a parameter.

It is now easier to create unit tests: you can do so directly from the code header. 
Additionally, if a window contains unit tests, they now appear in the header and can be started directly from the code editor. 
This encourages developers to create and run tests, thus improving code and application quality.
