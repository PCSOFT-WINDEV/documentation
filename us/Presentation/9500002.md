		3 NEW SMART CONTROLS IN WINDEV 28
	

	
		 
	
		3 new Smart controls provided in WINDEV 28
	

	
		Smart controls save valuable time during the UI creation process, and immediately make your applications more sophisticated. 

3 new Smart controls (common to WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile) are introduced in version 28: 

- Multi-selection with tokens.

- Badge.

- Address autocomplete.


Reminder: Smart controls are provided with their source code, and are therefore completely modifiable and customizable.
	




 
	
		New Smart control: multi-selection with tokens
	

	
		The "Multi-selection with tokens" Smart control allows you to select one or more tokens from the list.
![Multiple selection with tokens](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WD-ChampM%E9tier3.png)

	




 
	
		New Smart control: badge
	

	
		The "Badge" Smart control shows a badge (small circle with a number) on a given control. 
A badge can be used to draw the user's attention: number of pending orders, etc. 
The small icon that displays the number can be positioned on any type of control: Button, Static, Image...
![Here, the badge (red circle with the number) appears on a Button control](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WD-ChampM%E9tier1.png)

	




 
	
		New Smart control: address autocomplete
	

	
		The "Address autocomplete" Smart control suggests addresses as you type. 
A list of addresses is displayed. 
Please bear in mind that this control is based on a Google API. Google may require you to pay a subscription fee, depending on the number of requests.
![Several address suggestions appear when the end user starts typing](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WD-ChampM%E9tier2.png)

		![You can now format all the text in your applications](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Markdown%20Interrupteur2.png)
With Markdown support in version 28, you can customize the format of all the text in a control. 
This allows you to easily enrich the UI in your applications.

![Easy formatting with Markdown](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Markdown%20Menu2.png)
Because of its simplicity, Markdown text is easy to translate. 
Markdown text automatically adapts to the style of the control, most notably to the dark theme.

For more details, see [Markdown](../Editeurs/9000210.md). 
	




 
	
		Floating tab panes: optimizations
	

	
		Floating tab panes allow end users to freely position tabs and customize their UI. 
In version 28, a much smoother animation appears when moving these tab panes.
	




 
	
		Tab icons and text: better spacing
	

	
		Now you can set margins for tab icons and texts. 
The layout improves automatically.
![In edit mode, you can see the margins that have been applied around the icons](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Picto%20Libell%E9%20Onglet%20marges.png)


![A clean layout at runtime:
no more icons touching the borders!](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Picto%20Libell%E9%20Onglet%20marges%20ex%E9cution.png)

	




 
	
		Button control: custom borders
	

	
		A Button control can have borders that change depending on the state of the button: pressed, hover,... 
In version 28, you can define the border settings for each state in the "Style" tab of the 7-tab window.
![Easily select the type of border for each state](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Cadre%20btn.jpg)

	




 
	
		Image Editor control
	

	
		With the Image Editor control, you can include a full-blown image editor in your applications without writing a single line of code. 
In version 28, this control benefits from new features:

- Animated GIFs

- A new event is available in the code editor: "After running OCR", which allows you to retrieve and process the text

- A new button allows you to scan and automatically retrieve the image

- AI transforms freehand drawings into the corresponding object: line, rectangle, circle...



	




 
	
		Buttons with free icon positioning
	

	
		If a button contains an icon with free positioning, you have the ability to specify the coordinates. 
You can choose how the content of the icon will be displayed: aligned, homothetic...
	




 
	
		Scientific input mask
	

	
		A new input mask is available for numeric Edit controls: scientific notation. 
For example, you can get the following syntax without third-party tools: 1,23E+10.
	




 
	
		2 new skin templates for WINDEV
	

	
		Two new skin templates are introduced in version 28: Eleven and Touch. 
This allows for new customization possibilities.
	




 
	
		Menu control: new separator with text
	

	
		A menu can contain one or more separators. 
In version 28, this separator can contain a text.
![The menu separator can now include text](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Menu%20Libell%E9%20avec%20s%E9parateur.png)

	




 
	
		Menu control: visual options
	

	
		You can define "5-state" icons (e.g. buttons) in the menu options via the-7 tab window or programmatically.
![5-state icon](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WD%20-%20Menu%20contextuel%20option%20dynamique.png)

	




 
	
		Combo Box control: rounded corners, borders with rules, custom hover bar
	

	
		In version 28, the expanded area of a Combo Box can be customized:

- border 

- hover bar 

- row height 

- ...This allows you to create modern, sleek Combo Box controls.


![A clean Combo Box...](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WD%20-%20Combo%20a%E9r%E9e%20Windows%2011.png)

	




 
	
		Static control: rotation effect
	

	
		Static controls can now be rotated. This rotation is specified in the "Style" tab of the 7-tab window.
![Rotated text (in red)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WD%20-%20Champ%20libell%E9%20avec%20une%20rotation%203.png)

	




 
	
		Edit control: new autocomplete event
	

	
		The Edit control has an autocomplete feature available to the end user. 
In version 28, the "Select a value in the list of input suggestions" event allows the application to determine which suggestion was selected by the end user. 
With this new feature, you can assign a value different from the one shown in the suggestions to the Edit control: an acronym, for example, ...
	



	


<a name="help_of_your_applications"></a>

	
		HELP OF YOUR APPLICATIONS
	

	
		 
	
		Export help to PDF
	

	
		As you know, in WINDEV you can generate a help file for the end user. 
It can be an HTML or PDF file. 
The PDF version now allows navigation through automatically generated links.

		![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WD%20-%20Installe%20relook%E9e.png)
The auto-generated setup program of your WINDEV applications looks better than ever! 
The interface has been revised, and a modern style has been applied for a more user-friendly feel.
	




 
	
		Install: available update notification while using the application
	

	
		When an update becomes available for an application that is in use, an automatic toast message can be displayed.

The toast message gives the user two options:

- perform the update immediately, 

- get a reminder next time they start the application.


![This toast message lets the user know when an update is available. 
 It appears when the application is running, at the bottom right of the screen](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Notif%20Maj%20Appli.jpg)

<a name="webdev_site_in_window"></a>

	
		A WEBDEV SITE IN A WINDEV WINDOW
	

	
		 
	
		Combine 2 existing sets of elements: Desktop application and Website
	

	
		By integrating a website into a window in a desktop application, you can share existing elements and boost productivity.
	




 
	
		Integrate a WEBDEV page into a WINDEV window
	

	
		WINDEV's new "WEBDEV Page" control allows you to integrate a website into a WINDEV application, and to interact with this site programmatically. 
Simply specify the URL of the page to insert. 
The window that contains the control interacts with the page via browser procedures. 
These procedures are accessible in the WINDEV code editor and benefit from code completion.

For more details, see [Integrating a WEBDEV site into a WINDEV application](../Editeurs/1410086640.md). 
	




 
	
		Interaction: call page procedures from the window
	

	
		The WEBDEV page procedures that can be called from a WINDEV window must be declared in a shared interface. 
These procedures can make AJAX calls to the server. 
Code example: 
Code in the WEBDEV page 

```wl
// Declarations
implements Interface_containing_accessible_methods_of_the_page
uses Interface_containing_the_available_callbacks_from_page_to_window
// Use
MyHostControl.ACallback()
```
Code in the WINDEV window

```wl
// Declaration
uses Interface_containing_accessible_methods_of_the_page
implements Interface_containing_the_available_callbacks_from_page_to_window
// Use
WEBDEV_Page_control.Page.APageProcedure()
```




For more details, see [Integrating a WEBDEV site into a WINDEV application](../Editeurs/1410086640.md). 
	




 
	
		Interaction: call window procedures from the page
	

	
		The WINDEV procedures that can be called from the WEBDEV page must be declared in a shared interface. 
This interface generates a configuration file. 
This configuration file must be provided to the WEBDEV environment, which will then allow you to natively call the procedures. 
You will be able to call the window procedures directly from the code of the Browser procedures of the page.

For more details, see [Integrating a WEBDEV site into a WINDEV application](../Editeurs/1410086640.md). 
	




 
	
		New layout available for the WEBDEV page
	

	
		A web page can contain menus, an ad banner, style controls, a footer with the legal notice... 
This information may no longer be useful when the page is integrated into a WINDEV application. 
To solve this, a new type of layout specific to the WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile integration is now available in WEBDEV. This layout allows you to avoid displaying certain information.

For more details, see [Integrating a WEBDEV site into a WINDEV application](../Editeurs/1410086640.md). 
	




 
	
		Security: first level
	

	
		The page and the window must exchange data in a secure way. 
To start with, navigation in the WEBDEV page is limited to the domain of the URL provided in the application: this eliminates the risk of cross-site scripting attacks (XSS).

If the WEBDEV page contains sensitive data, there are several methods to secure access to the page:

- Setting up an authentication method with Windows session login credentials (Single sign-on (SSO))

- Requesting site login credentials at the start of the session and storing the encrypted login information in memory

- Requesting site login credentials every time the user tries to access the page, etc.


This information is then sent through a secure HTTPS URL.

For more details, see [Integrating a WEBDEV site into a WINDEV application](../Editeurs/1410086640.md). 
	




 
	
		Security: second level
	

	
		You can implement additional security features. 
Two-factor authentication, with a code sent via email, for example. 
IP address-based restriction can also be easily implemented.

For more details, see [Integrating a WEBDEV site into a WINDEV application](../Editeurs/1410086640.md). 
	




 
	
		Seamlessly webify existing resources
	

	
		Many new development projects are intended for the Web. 
However, most existing projects consist of Windows applications. 
Integrating a website into a WINDEV window is a major step to preserve and webify a company's software assets without sacrificing functionality. 
This allows for rapid, agile, risk-free, step-by-step progress.

For more details, see [Integrating a WEBDEV site into a WINDEV application](../Editeurs/1410086640.md). 
	



	


<a name="windev_environment"></a>

	
		WINDEV ENVIRONMENT
	

	
		 
	
		Common new features
	

	
		WINDEV's environment benefits from the common new features in version 28. 
In particular: Modern UI, live data for images in the 7-tab window, new control sizing handles, snap-on feature using the keyboard, new style selection window, etc.
	




 
	
		Miscellaneous
	

	
		

- When creating a project, the 64-bit mode and the use of Unicode strings are enabled by default.

- The "buffer security check" mode is enabled for 64 bit-executables.



	



	


<a name="window_editor"></a>

	
		WINDOW EDITOR
	

	
		 
	
		A host of new features
	

	
		The WINDEV window editor benefits from the following new features: snap-on feature with the keyboard, more user-friendly control handles, new style editing window, custom shortcuts, ...
	




 
	
		Format painter
	

	
		In version 28, you can easily copy and apply formatting to controls: the format painter is available in the style sheet editor.
	




 
	
		Context menu of controls: better, more efficient
	

	
		The context menus of the window and page editors have been completely revised for a better experience.
	




 
	
		UI error: new errors detected
	

	
		

- If a table does not support per-pixel scrolling, the editor shows an error and prompts you to fix it with one click.

- Context menu: if two menu options have the same value (defined in the 7-tab window), a UI error is generated.

- If a window opened with [Info](../WDLang1/3021011.md), [YesNo](../WDLang1/3021005.md), or similar functions is not customized, a UI error appears. A custom window provides a better user experiences because it allows the use of AAFs: timer...



	



	


<a name="Modern_UI"></a>

	
		MODERN UI: BIGGER, BETTER
	

	
		 
	
		Move towards a modern, well-spaced UI design language
	

	
		New features in the editor in version 28 allow you to automatically modify existing UIs and meet current expectations: spacing and resizing.
	




 
	
		Enlarge the font and the host control
	

	
		Current UIs tend to use larger fonts in the different controls. 
In version 28, the font size of all the controls in a window can be automatically increased. This avoids having to change the skin template and resize controls one by one. 
When the font is resized, all the controls are automatically enlarged and moved to preserve the current layout. The window itself is also enlarged.

![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WD%20-%20Agrandissement%20des%20polices.png)


For more details, see [Enlarging a window](../Editeurs/2022008.md). 
	




 
	
		Spacing of controls
	

	
		Another current design trend is to increase spacing between the controls in a window. 
A new feature analyzes the spacing between controls in an existing window, and shifts the coordinates of each control using a given factor, expressed as a percentage. 
For example, 20% spacing shifts the controls by 20%. 
The window will also be resized using the same factor.

![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WD%20-%20Espacement%20des%20champ.png)


For more details, see [Spacing out a selection of controls](../Editeurs/2022007.md). 
	




 
	
		Windows 11 skin template
	

	
		WINDEV 28 includes a skin template that follows the main Windows 11 UI design guidelines. 
Use this skin template to obtain a Windows 11 layout immediately. 
See new feature 212.
	




 
	
		Touch-friendly skin template
	

	
		WINDEV 28 includes a specific skin template for touch-friendly UIs. 
This skin template adapts all clickable areas: bigger buttons, combo box arrows, check boxes, radio buttons, input areas... 
For example, this skin template can be used to easily create interactive kiosks, restaurant kiosks, interactive screens for the real estate industry... 
See new feature 212.
	



	


<a name="rad"></a>

	
		RAD
	

	
		 
	
		RAD: RAD details of the analysis
	

	
		For each item, the data model editor allows you to specify information that can be used in the RAD methodology: type of control to be generated, content of the control, general properties... 
The RAD will use this information to generate windows and pages. 
In version 28, you can differentiate this information by platform: PC, Web, Mobile.
	



	


<a name="windev_private_store"></a>

	
		WINDEV PRIVATE STORE

		In version 28, the Supervisor can authorize one or more users to upload applications to the Store.
	




 
	
		End user: Seamless transition from setup on the network to setup on the Private Store
	

	
		Today, in many organizations, applications are installed via a setup file on the network. 
When an application already deployed via the network becomes available on the Private Store, end users do not need to download the application again. 
The application will automatically switch to the Store's Live Update system for future updates.
	




 
	
		Name setup files
	

	
		In version 28, you can rename the setup files of applications available on the Private Store.
	




 
	
		End user: setup mode
	

	
		For security reasons, Internet browsers prevent executables from automatically running on the PC. 
The steps to run an executable may be different depending on the browser. 
The Private Store download page now shows a step-by-step guide for the corresponding browser.
