		NEW TOP BARS: ACTION BAR / NAVIGATION BAR
	

	
		 
	
		Top bar: standard behavior
	

	
		The top bar is known as "Action Bar" in Android and "Navigation Bar" in iOS. However, for the purpose of simplicity, the term "Action bar" will be used often in the rest of this document. 
This bar can be defined by the system, or be customized. 
A system bar can have the following characteristics:

- Optional button on the left of the bar. This button can be used to go back, open a window or perform a custom process.

- Optional button on the right of the bar. This button should open a menu.

- The bar can be hidden automatically when scrolling.

- The bar can use a system color or a custom color.

- Ability to apply the title font color to icons.

- The bar can use a background image (9-slice scaling mode supported).

		Top bar: advanced customization
	

	
		In version 28, bar customization has been drastically improved. 
You can now fine-tune different aspects of the bars:

- You can set the bar height.

- It is now possible to insert any type of control.




For example, you can:

- insert a logo or an image.

- insert a search field.

- center a title.

- show options as tokens.

- dynamically change the content of the bar.

- pin a subscription button.

- ... 


Everything can be easily customized!

		KANBAN FOR MOBILE DEVICES - FULL INTEROPERABILITY
	

	
		 
	
		Kanban control on mobile devices
	

	
		In version 28, the Kanban control is also available for mobile devices.

The Kanban methodology is often used to manage tasks on mobile devices, since users carry their mobile devices with them most of the time.
	




 
	
		Kanban control on mobile devices: specific features
	

	
		For better readability, only one column is displayed in portrait mode.
Contiguous columns are partially displayed on each side of the current column.
Users can navigate between lists (columns) by swiping left or right.
Users can also tap and hold a card to move it horizontally or vertically.
If necessary, the Kanban control changes to the target list (column) to complete the operation.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Kanban%20Mobile.png)
In landscape mode, multiple lists (columns) are displayed.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Kanban%20Mobile%201.png)

		New Smart control: "Show more"
	

	
		The "Show more" Smart control allows you to show only the beginning of a text, thus making the UI lighter. 
If a user wants to read the rest of the text, they can simply tap the "Show more" button. 
The full text is then displayed.<br>![The text is truncated, but the user can tap "Show more" to see the full text](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WM%20-%20Champ%20m%E9tier%20voir%20plus.png)

	




 
	
		New Smart control: badge
	

	
		The "Badge" Smart control shows a badge containing a value over a control: image, button, etc.<br>![Standard UI behavior](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WM-ChampM%E9tier1%20ROND.png)

		TRANSFORM YOUR WINDEV APPLICATIONS INTO IOS & ANDROID APPS: EASIER AND EASIER
	

	
		 
	
		Transition to mobile devices made easier
	

	
		Transforming your existing WINDEV applications (or parts of applications) into iOS and Android applications is easier than ever before. 
The integration of the WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile environments allows developers to easily share project elements. 
The conversion wizard has been improved and is even more precise.
	



	


<a name="windev_mobile_in_the_windev_editor"></a>

	
		WINDEV MOBILE IN WINDEV EDITOR
	

	
		 
	
		Reminder: open and handle WINDEV Mobile projects in WINDEV
	

	
		To make cross-platform development easier, WINDEV can open WINDEV Mobile projects (and WEBDEV projects as well). 
This avoids duplicating code and objects and performing unnecessary operations. Objects are shared immediately. 
The same project in WINDEV can contain WINDEV, iOS and Android configurations (and even WEBDEV configurations). 
Note: a WINDEV Mobile (and/or WEBDEV) license is required.
	



	


<a name="other_commonm_new_features_ios_android"></a>

	
		OTHER COMMON NEW FEATURES FOR IOS/ANDROID
	

	
		 
	
		open an application from a link on the web or in an email (Deep link / universal link)
	

	
		In version 28, you can allow users to open an application from a link in a website or in an email. This link can contain parameters that will be passed to the application. 
This method is known as Deep Link in Android, and Universal Link in iOS. 
If the application is not yet installed on the device, the page specified in the link opens and generally prompts the user to download the application from a store. 
Example of code embedded in a link: 

```txt
https://precilia.com/ad?ad_id=254z7846
```
<br>![The OPEN button on the site or email launches the app and opens the selected ad](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=OUvrir%20une%20appli%20depuis%20un%20lien.png)


Security: the web server used must allow the application to be launched: a settings file must be present on the server.
	




 
	
		Deep Link, Universal link: callback
	

	
		A callback mechanism allows you to pass parameters, or to indicate to the application that it has been launched via a link. 
Simply pass the callback to the new [DeepLinkProcedure](../WDLang3/1410089051.md) function.
	




 
	
		Interactive WEBDEV page in a mobile window
	

	
		<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WM%20-%20Page%20Webdev%20dans%20App%20mobile.png)
In version 28, a page or a site can be inserted into a window in a WINDEV Mobile application. 
The app and the page exchange data using WLanguage. 
This new feature allows you to maximize the use of your existing elements. 
To learn more, go to new feature 215.
	




 
	
		Text formatting variants
	

	
		In version 28, you can quickly see how changes in character and line spacing affect text layout. 

	




 
	
		"Glove-friendly" skin template
	

	
		WINDEV Mobile 28 includes a new skin template. It is intended to make a touchscreen easier to use with gloves in very cold temperatures, for example. With larger controls and buttons, the "glove-friendly" skin template allows users to easily select elements. 
See new feature 476.
	



	


<a name="formatting_variants"></a>

	
		FORMATTING VARIANTS
	

	
		 
	
		Easily customize text in windows and pages
	

	
		You can customize text attributes such as character spacing, line spacing and font size in a window or page.
 You can manually adjust these settings in the 7-tab window. 
A new preview window in version 28 shows and suggests preset combinations of these attributes.
	


 
	
		View different combinations at a glance
	

	
		In version 28, a new window shows you different formatting combinations applied to your UI.
This way, you can select the right layout for each text without having to try different settings one by one.
 This window supports multiple selection.
	


 
	
		Keep the settings that work for you
	

	
		Once applied, you can change specific settings in a given combination, (e.g., increase font size).
To keep and reuse your custom combinations, simply create a style based on the custom control.
	



	


<a name="and_for_ios"></a>

	
		AND FOR IOS
	

	
		 
	
		All the common new features for mobile apps
	

	
		iOS development has never been as powerful as with WINDEV Mobile 28. The amount of powerful features at your disposal keeps growing. 
iOS evolves, and so does WINDEV Mobile 28.

WINDEV Mobile 28 for iOS benefits from:

- the common new features in version 28.

- plus the common new features for mobile devices.

- plus new features specific to iOS. 



	




 
	
		iOS 16, new iPhone 14
	

	
		<br>![iPhone 14 and Apple Watch Series 8](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=iphone14-Dynamic-Island-ferm%E9e-pizza-min.png)
WINDEV Mobile 28 supports both iOS 16 and WatchOS 9. 
All iPhone 14 and AppleWatch Series 8 models are supported.
	




 
	
		IPhone 14: dynamic island
	

	
		<br>![Expanded dynamic island, with an available action](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=iphone14-Dynamic-Island-pizza-min.png)
One major feature of the latest iPhone is the Dynamic Island, which transforms the black notch into a widget. 
WINDEV Mobile 28 supports this new behavior. 
Simply define the UI of the Widgets with Swift UI, then use WLanguage to automatically generate the widgets in the project and specify the callback procedure that will be called when the user interacts with the widget.

For more details, see [Dynamic Island](../Editeurs/1000019930.md). 
	




 
	
		iPadOS 16
	

	
		The new iPadOS 16 is supported. 
Stage Manager is supported in version 28: it is now possible to create resizable windows. 
You can also create Extra Large Widgets.
	




 
	
		Always-on display and lock screen
	

	
		iOS 16 allows you to create Widgets that will be displayed on the lock screen, whether or not the Always-On display is enabled. 
In WINDEV Mobile 28, you can create this type of widget.
	




 
	
		Share data between Apple devices through iCloud
	

	
		How to share data between Apple devices using iCloud? 
The new iCloud family of WLanguage functions allows you to store data or "key/value" pairs in iCloud, and thus to access that data from all devices: iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, MacBook, etc. 
Reminder: depending on the volume of data, an HFSQL database in the cloud (HFSQLDrive, PCSCloud.net, etc.) is a simple and powerful data sharing solution.

For more details, see: [iCloud functions](../WDLang3/1410088863.md)
	




 
	
		Data sharing between Widget and app, and between apps on the same device
	

	
		In version 28, you can make a directory accessible from different applications and Widgets. This will allow easy data sharing. 
The new [iOSAppGroupDirectory](../WDLang3/1410088694.md) function has been introduced with this purpose in mind.
	




 
	
		RTPP - Real-time or log-based debugging in WINDEV Mobile
	

	
		The powerful Real-Time Performance Profiler, which allows debugging and analyzing app performance in real time and based on log files, is available for iOS. 
See new feature 110.
	




 
	
		IOS: miscellaneous
	

	
		

- Mac Catalyst now supports the Webcam control.

- Mac Catalyst: ability to specify the Provisioning Profile directly in the generation wizard.



	




 
	
		3 new types
	

	
		3 new types of variables are available for iOS:
	




 
	
		72 NEW WLANGUAGE FUNCTIONS FOR IOS, 31 CONSTANTS
	

	
		WLanguage is enriched with 72 new functions for iOS, as well as 31 new constants, 1 property and 41 functions for iOS widgets (see full list on windev.com).

		AND FOR ANDROID
	

	
		 
	
		All the common new features for mobile apps
	

	
		Development for Android has never been as powerful as with WINDEV Mobile 28. 
The amount of powerful features at your disposal keeps growing. 
Android evolves, and so does WINDEV Mobile 28, most notably with its support for Android 13.

WINDEV Mobile 28 for Android benefits from:

- the common new features in version 28.

- plus the common new features for mobile devices.

- plus new features specific to Android.



	




 
	
		Android 13 support
	

	
		WINDEV Mobile 28 supports the latest version of Android.
	




 
	
		Native Kotlin
	

	
		WINDEV Mobile is open to third-party languages. 
Kotlin is a programming language mainly used for Android development. 
In version 28, you can write Kotlin code in the code editor directly. 
Syntax highlighting makes it easier to write and read code in this language. 
Note: Java is still supported, of course.

```txt
// saves a video preview image at a given position
fun getVideoFramePreview(videoPath: String, position: Long,
saveToPath: String) {
var bitmap: Bitmap? = null
val retriever = MediaMetadataRetriever()
// loads the video
retriever.setDataSource(videoPath)
...
}
```


For more details, see [Using Kotlin code](../Editeurs/9000209.md).
	




 
	
		Retrieve the result of an activity from third-party libraries and Android APIs
	

	
		<br>![Most payment apps use clear implementations of Activities](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WM-Paiement-Mobile-Fenetre-Activity-SANS-Recadrage.jpg)
In a WINDEV Mobile application, you can use external libraries and APIs.

In Android, some libraries and APIs open specific windows, known as "Activities", which perform specific processes:

- mobile payment

- Bluetooth visibility

- OAuth login request

- ...


WINDEV Mobile 28 allows you to easily retrieve the results of these Activities. 
The new [AndroidActivityResultProcedure](../WDLang3/1410088881.md) function allows you to specify the WLanguage procedure that will be called when the Activity is closed. 
This WLanguage procedure will receive the result as a parameter.
	




 
	
		Per-pixel positioning for button icons
	

	
		You can now position icons with pixel precision inside buttons.
	




 
	
		Chrono type support
	

	
		The [Chrono](../WDLang1/1000023560.md) type is now supported in Android.
	




 
	
		Data source parameters
	

	
		A query based on a data source can contain parameters.
	




 
	
		Access bits in integers
	

	
		In the industrial field, it is often necessary to read the bits in a byte. In version 28, the [] (square brackets) syntax is available for variables of type Integer.
	




 
	
		WLanguage functions to manage zoomed images
	

	
		When an image is zoomed in an Image control, the coordinates of a point in the control no longer match the coordinates of that point in the original image. 
The [CoordinateImageControlToImage](../WDLang1/1000026037.md) and [CoordinateImageToImageControl](../WDLang1/1000026038.md) functions allow you to find the coordinates in the original image (and vice versa). 
See the list of new WLanguage functions in the new feature 622.
	




 
	
		WLanguage: State property on containers
	

	
		The [State](../Proprietes/2510039.md) property is available for Container controls: Supercontrol, Internal Window, Tab control, etc. 
For example, this allows you to gray out all the controls inside a container with one line of code.
	




 
	
		WLanguage: 5 new types
