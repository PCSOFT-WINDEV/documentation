WEBDEV includes several WEBDEV Application Servers: 

- **Full WEBDEV Application Server** (deployment version): This Application Server provides you with all the features in WEBDEV: 

	- Unlimited connections for WEBDEV sites and web services, 

	- Specific applications (Replication server, Telemetry server, BaaS modules, web services for access to third-party databases).   

	- WEBDEV Cluster support.  

	- Web administrators: SaaS, HFSQL, WEBDEV Application Server.




- **WEBDEV Application Server - 10 connections**: This Application Server supports up to 10 simultaneous connections to WEBDEV sites and web services. 

- **The Reserved Server**: This Application Server does not support WEBDEV sites and web services. Only specific applications are available (Replication server, Telemetry server, BaaS modules, web services for access to third-party databases). 




Remarks: 

- You can use WEBDEV Application Server - 10 connections in conjunction with the Reserved Server. 

- Starting with version 28, a single setup program is used to install both the full version of WEBDEV Application Server and WEBDEV Application Server - 10 connections.
