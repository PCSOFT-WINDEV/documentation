		NEW KANBAN CONTROL - BOARD WITH CARDS
	

	
		 
	
		New Kanban control
	

	
		The new Kanban control stands out as one of the most versatile new features in version 28.
All the features of a Kanban board become available by simply dropping the control onto a window or page.
<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Kanban%20-%20Gala.png)


For more details, see [The Kanban control](../WDChamp/1410087203.md). 
	




 
	
		What is Kanban?
	

	
		Originally, Kanban is a Japanese method aimed at improving processes for a better, more efficient production cycle.
Today, Kanban also refers to a method in which tasks are visually classified, allowing for better task management.
Each task is written on a "card" that will move to a different list (column) according to its progress status.
In addition to tasks, these cards can represent any other type of resource: user story, requirement, suggestion, manufacturing stage, delivery, troubleshooting, etc.
A Kanban board is commonly shared between several users.
Each member of the team knows the progress status of the project, and knows what both themselves and the other members have to do.
In addition to better communication, this card-based method provides a clear overview of the production chain and the progress of the tasks, thus allowing members to easily identify bottlenecks and priority tasks.

For more details, see [The Kanban control](../WDChamp/1410087203.md). 
	




 
	
		Kanban control: main features
	

	
		The Kanban control in version 28 includes all the features that users expect:

- define lists (columns) 

- create and edit cards 

- remove cards 

- move cards: vertically to change priority, horizontally to move to another list 

- manage user rights 

- ...


All these features, included directly in the control, are available to the end users of your applications and sites. You can also handle these features programmatically.

For more details, see [The Kanban control](../WDChamp/1410087203.md). 
	




 
	
		Kanban control: lists (columns)
	

	
		The number of lists (columns) can be defined programmatically or via the 7-tab window.
There are many options for each list:

- title

- appearance: background color, separation color, etc.

- background image

- width: fixed or proportional

- number of cards in the column

- maximum number of cards per column

- "+" button to add cards

- ...


These options allow you to fully customize the Kanban board.
Note: you can write Markdown text.

For more details, see [The Kanban control](../WDChamp/1410087203.md). 
	




 
	
		Kanban control: cards
	

	
		You can customize the appearance of cards.
A default card template is provided.
A major advantage of these cards is that they can contain Internal Windows or Internal Pages, and thus contain any kind of control.
You can customize all cards at once, one by one, or even customize groups of cards.
The height of a card can vary.
The width of a card depends on the width of the column, but can also be set manually.

For more details, see [The Kanban control](../WDChamp/1410087203.md). 
	




 
	
		Kanban control: save the details of your cards
	

	
		By default, the characteristics of a Kanban board are stored in a data file.
You can manipulate the data format as required.
As for the structure of the data file, simply define the items that will contain the details of the Kanban board:

- list 

- priority 

- card text

- card owner 

- label 

- date 

- ...


A full example based on an HFSQL data file is provided.
Data binding (automatic link between the card and the data) is available for even easier programming.
Please note that bi-directional data binding is enabled by default.
Of course, you can also populate and save the Kanban board programmatically.
	




 
	
		Kanban control: manage user rights
	

	
		The Kanban control allows you to manage user rights:

- move cards vertically (change priority)

- move cards horizontally (change list)

- create cards

- edit cards

- remove cards

- ...


You can manage rights programmatically..
	




 
	
		Kanban control: programming
	

	
		You can manage various features of the Kanban control programmatically:

- the appearance of the Kanban control

- the content of the Kanban control

- the management of rights


The Kanban control, as well as the lists and cards have properties that allow you to configure all these elements.
You can add and remove lists and cards programmatically.
[kbCard](../WDLang1/1410089167.md), a new native WLanguage type, allows you to handle the content of a Kanban control.

The [kbCard](../WDLang1/1410089167.md) type contains the following properties:

- title 

- priority 

- text 

- contributor 

- date 

- optional internal window or page to customize a given card

- ... 


You can handle lists programmatically, just like you handle columns in a table: it's a skill you already master!
Code sample:

```wl
// Iterates over pending tasks for the contributor "JohnDoe"
FOR EACH Card OF KB_Sprint.TaskToDo.Cards
	IF Card.Contributor = "JohnDoe" THEN
	...
	END
END
```

		NEW CHART CONTROL
	

	
		 
	
		New Chart control: Polar Area
	

	
		A new type of chart is introduced in version 28: the Polar Area chart.
This type of chart is mainly used to compare target values or market shares, or to illustrate a progress percentage. The value is not represented by the angle of the segment, but by the radius.<br>![Polar Area chart](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Graphe%20aire%20polaire.jpg)

		EDIT SITES AND MOBILE APPS IN WINDEV
	

	
		 
	
		No need to duplicate your projects: one single environment
	

	
		As you know, it is possible to use WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile in the same environment.
Project elements are immediately shared between all 3 platforms: analyses, queries, reports, procedures, classes, code, etc.
Windows, pages, mobile windows are in the same project.
These elements open directly in the WINDEV environment .
This allows for easy maintenance and portability of a WINDEV application to mobile and Web, without having to import or duplicate elements of the project.
Reminder: you need a license of the corresponding software products.
	



	


<a name="transform_windev_applications_into_saas"></a>

	
		TRANSFORM WINDEV APPLICATIONS INTO SAAS
	

	
		 
	
		Transform existing WINDEV elements into a SaaS application
	

	
		Developers often need to transform Windows applications (or parts of applications) into dynamic websites or SaaS applications.
WEBDEV 28 allows developers to use their existing WINDEV projects and take advantage of the SaaS features that come as standard.
	



	


<a name="markdown_everywhere"></a>

	
		MARKDOWN EVERYWHERE: CONTROLS, LABELS, MENUS, TOOLTIPS AND MORE
	

	
		 
	
		What is Markdown?
	

	
		Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to apply formatting to text. It works on all platforms: PC, Web, Mobile.
Because of its simplicity and practicality, Markdown is easy to read, learn and remember.
For example: wrap text in double asterisks (\*\*) to apply bold formatting, use # at the start of a line to create a title, ## to create a subtitle, etc.
	




 
	
		Markdown in all types of text: control captions, column headers, menu options, tooltips, etc.
	

	
		In version 28, you can easily write and format "text" in many UI elements using Markdown (without gPen, gImage, etc.).
This may include, for example:

- static text in an Edit control 

- static text in a menu option 

- a column header 

- a tooltip 

- information text 

- ...



	




 
	
		Convert Markdown text to PDF, DOCX or HTML
	

	
		Use the new [MarkdownToDOCX](../WDLang1/1410089153.md), [MarkdownToPDF](../WDLang1/1410089119.md) and [MarkdownToHTML](../WDLang1/1410088874.md) functions to convert Markdown text to those formats.
	



	


<a name="new_features_of_controls"></a>

	
		NEW FEATURES FOR CONTROLS
	

	
		 
	
		Diagram Editor control: freehand drawing
	

	
		With the Diagram Editor control, you can now allow end users to draw freehand.
Each drawing can then be manipulated like any other object, in the editor or programmatically.
	




 
	
		Diagram Editor control: new property on shapes to authorize specific actions
	

	
		With the new **ActionAllowed** property, you can allow or prevent the user from performing specific actions on any shape in a diagram:

- move 

- resize 

- select 

- edit text 

- delete 

- copy 

- ... 


By default, all actions are available to the end user.
	




 
	
		All the controls: The "Extra" property, even better than "Note"
	

	
		You can assign additional content to a control programmatically, and get it later.
This is the purpose of the [Note](../Proprietes/2510085.md) property, which stores strings.
In version 28, the new [Extra](../Proprietes/1410089327.md) property allows you to store "key/value" pairs of any type. This allows for more structured information compared to simple strings: objects, records, queries...
	




 
	
		Internal Window control: it can be cleared
	

	
		Now, you can "clear" the contents of an Internal Window control.
The [ChangeSourceWindow](../WDLang1/3038053.md) function accepts "empty string" as a parameter.
	



	


<a name="new_features_of_pdf_controls"></a>

	
		NEW FEATURES IN PDF CONTROLS
	

	
		 
	
		Generate PDF forms
	

	
		In version 28, you can create PDF forms using the report editor.
In addition to the controls available in the report editor, you can include the following types of controls in PDF reports:

- Edit control

- Check Box

- Combo Box.


In version 28, you can create reports and include these controls to automatically generate interactive PDF forms.
End users will be able to enter data, print or save the form.<br>![PDF form to fill out](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WD-Champ-PDF-Programmation-PDF-Editeur-d-Etat.png)

	




 
	
		PDF Reader control: Integrated OCR
	

	
		Generally, users can select text in standard PDF documents.
However, some PDF documents may prevent the user from copying text, for example, if the text has been scanned.
Now, this text can be retrieved using the native OCR integrated into WINDEV's PDF Reader control.
OCR is run on an area defined by the end user.<br>![The automatic OCR can be used to get an IBAN present in an image, and allow users to copy/paste it afterwards.](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=OCR%20PDF%20yacht.jpg)

	




 
	
		PDF files generated via a report are now 2 to 10 times smaller
	

	
		A document can be composed of a series of reports and PDF pages.
Generating a single PDF document from this series of elements drastically reduces the size of the resulting file.
	




 
	
		PDF in the background of a report: the resulting PDF file is 2 to 10 times smaller
	

	
		A report can use a PDF document as background.
The report itself can then be generated as a PDF document.
The weight of the resulting PDF file (that already uses a PDF background) is reduced by at least 50%.
	




 
	
		PDF file generation 2 to 25 times faster
	

	
		In version 28, the PDF generation process is dramatically faster.
2 to 25 times faster, depending on the size of the documents.
	




 
	
		Set the compression ratio and quality
	

	
		<br>![The size of the PDF file varies depending on the quality level chosen](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Qualite%20PDF%20parametrable.png)
In version 28, you can define the quality and weight of the resulting document by setting a compression ratio.
This allows you to adapt the size of the document: the lower the quality, the lighter the document.
You can set this compression ratio with the new Quality parameter of the [PDFSave](../WDLang1/1000024898.md) function: Automatic, High, Average and Low.
	




 
	
		PDF signature: let the end user know if a certificate is valid
	

	
		The PDF Reader control shows a notification when a document is signed.
The user can see the details of the signature in the document reader.
In version 28, these notifications have been rewritten using non-technical terms. They are now clearer for the end user, thus providing better security:

- invalid certificate

- document modified after being signed

- ...

<br>![PDF signature details shown to the end user](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Signature%20PDF.png)

	




 
	
		Go to a bookmark programmatically
	

	
		In version 28, you can set the position directly on a given bookmark.
To do so, you can use the new [pdfBookmark](../WDLang6/1410089195.md) type and its Title and PageNumber properties, the new Bookmark property, and the new [PDFReaderGoToBookmark](../WDLang1/1410089202.md) function.

		Apply changes to a set of tables (data files)
	

	
		In version 28, the data model editor allows you to select a set of tables and apply changes to this set in a single operation.
You no longer need to make these changes on each description.
	




 
	
		Duplicate item descriptions: in the same table or in another table (data file)
	

	
		You can now duplicate an item description, both within the same table and between different tables (data files).
	




 
	
		Representative icons
	

	
		In the data model editor, an icon now appears next to the name of the item, and the font weight indicates the type of item: unique key, primary key...<br>![Find what you need at a glance](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WX-Analyse-Icones%20representatives.png)

		Controls: snap-on feature with the keyboard
	

	
		In all the editors, you can move controls using the keyboard.
The snap-on mechanism is active while the control is moved: the control briefly stops at each location it can snap to.
In version 28, you can press 0 on the numeric keypad to see the gridlines.
	




 
	
		Better control sizing handles

		7-tab window: edit the image associated with the control directly from the style tab
	

	
		Cell, Button, or Image controls, for example, can contain an image.
In version 28, you can easily edit this image from the Style tab, using a new edit button.<br>![Edit the image directly](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=7%20onglets%20-%20%E9diter%20image%20PP.jpg)

	




 
	
		Unable to edit a control in the 7-tab window? The environment explains why
	

	
		Sometimes a control cannot be edited in the 7-tab window: the content of the tabs is grayed out.
There are many possible reasons: file in read-only mode, window not checked out from the SCM, control from a model without overrides, etc.
In version 28, the environment shows a message explaining why the options are disabled.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WD%20-%20Edition%20champ.png)

		Unusually slow application? see what's going on
	

	
		We've all been there: An application randomly slows down, without explanation.
WINDEV 28 helps you determine and fix the cause of the problem.
The Real-Time Performance Profiler (RTPP) displays an application activity chart. The data can be shown in real time, but also come from a log file.
This chart allows you to identify bottlenecks and causes of low performance.

For more details, see [Real-Time Performance Profiler (RTPP)](../Editeurs/9500237.md).

		<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Extrait%20thread%20en%20temps%20r%E9el.png)
The chart represents the application activity.
Data is shown in real time.
The chart uses two levels:

- The low level indicates that the application is in idle state. This means it is waiting for a user action (click, etc.)

- The high level indicates that the application is in use. This means it no longer responds to end-user actions.


You can scroll forward or backward through the chart, zoom in, and more.
High levels that take too long appear in red.
Click a high level section to see all the function calls, execution time of each function and even the code of these functions.
By analyzing the code, you can identify the cause of slowdowns.

For more details, see [Real-Time Performance Profiler (RTPP)](../Editeurs/9500237.md). 
	




 
	
		Real-time or log-based analysis
	

	
		There are three analysis modes:

- real time on the development computer (during tests)

- real time on a production computer

- later on, using a log file.


Use [dbgEnableLog](../WDLang1/1000017137.md) to write to the log file.

For more details, see [Real-Time Performance Profiler (RTPP)](../Editeurs/9500237.md). 
	




 
	
		RTPP: multithreaded apps as well

		WLANGUAGE
	

	
		 
	
		New type of string: undetectable (encrypted in memory)
	

	
		The new &lt;undetectable&gt; attribute automatically obfuscates the content of the string in memory.
The content of the undetectable string cannot be read in a memory dump file.

For more details, see [Character strings](../Motscles/1514044.md).
	




 
	
		Create your own WLanguage functions (Prefix syntax)
	

	
		"Extension functions" allow you to add your own WLanguage functions to types.
The functions you have defined can then be called as native WLanguage functions.
For example, you can create a function that replaces Tab characters with spaces in a string.
Your functions appear in the code completion drop-down list for the given type.<br>![Your function appears (in green) in the completion suggestions](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WD%20-%20RemplaceTabPar4Espaces.png)
Note: these functions can also be used in standard syntax.
	




 
	
		Advanced type to read files on disk
	

	
		The new [DiskFile](../WDLang1/1410088883.md) advanced type allows you to effortlessly handle files on disk, without having to manipulate handle numbers: binary file, parameter file, text file...
Prefix syntax is therefore available.
Code sample:
Important automatic security mechanism: the file is automatically closed when the variable is released.
The [DiskFile](../WDLang1/1410088883.md) type also allows you to handle temporary files.
The file is automatically closed and deleted when the variable is released.

		Socks5 proxy
	

	
		SOCKS5 is a network protocol for exchanging data through a proxy.
Version 28 natively supports this protocol.
The [Proxy](../WDLang3/3043002.md), [SocketProxy](../WDLang3/1410088761.md) and [FTPProxy](../WDLang3/1000019366.md) WLanguage functions allow you to specify the address of the SOCKS5 proxy.
Exchanges via HTTP, FTP, SFTP, socket, web services, etc. use this type of proxy.
	




 
	
		Local procedures: public or private?
	

	
		In version 28, you can define the scope of a local procedure and the global variables of the window or page: public or private.
Public procedures can be called outside the control.
Private procedures can only be called from within the control.
	




 
	
		New image functions
	

	
		Now, you have more possibilities to handle images:

- the [dRotation](../WDLang1/3029024.md) function has an option to adjust the image size after applying the rotation.

- the [dModifyContrast](../WDLang1/1410088872.md) function has been introduced.

		UTF-16BE and UTF-16LE are Unicode encoding standards (LE for Little Endian and BE for Big Endian).
LE and BE use different byte orders
The new UTFConvert function allows you to convert strings between these formats.
	




 
	
		Straighten skewed images
	

	
		The new dStraighten function in version 28 allows you to apply perspective correction to an image.
This function is based on a homeomorphic algorithm.<br>![The image is straightened](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WD-Nouvelle-Fonction-Redresse.png)

	




 
	
		Dynamic external component: loaded at runtime
	

	
		In version 28, external components can be loaded dynamically, which means you don't need to include the component in the project.
The new [ComponentLoad](../WDLang1/3014023.md) and [ComponentExecute](../WDLang1/1410089107.md) functions will prove extremely useful.
Combined with OOP interfaces, this new feature allows for a more cohesive architecture.

		The new [GenerateGeometricImage](../WDLang1/1410088705.md) function creates a random image containing simple geometric shapes. This image can then be used to fill the "photo" field on a user profile until the user provides their actual photo, for example.<br>![Rather than leaving an empty, undefined image, 
you can fill that space with a geometric pattern](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WX-Generation-Image-geometrique.png)

	




 
	
		Check the format of administrative numbers
	

	
		Version 28 includes new functions to check the validity of administrative numbers: SIREN, SIRET and INSEE.
This ensures you start searches using valid number formats.
France: SIREN, SIRET and INSEE
Belgium: NISS, CBE and EU
Switzerland: OASI, UID and BER
Canada: SIN, BN9 and BN15
United States of America: EIN, FEI, SSN
Germany: IdNr, UStIdNr
Italy: CF, IVA
Spain: DNI, NIF
Brazil: CNPJ, CPF
	




 
	
		Valid IBAN syntax
	

	
		The new [IBANValid](../WDLang1/1410089019.md) function checks if an IBAN passed as parameter is valid.
This ensures you start searches using valid number formats.
Caution: this does not mean the account exists.
	




 
	
		One single function to run OCR on a rectangular area
	

	
		The new PicRectangularSnipOCR function opens the rectangular snip tool, gets the result of the selection, runs OCR and returns the resulting text.<br>![Run OCR on an area](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=OCR%20PDF.png)

	




 
	
		Certificate integrated in the executable
	

	
		Signing or encryption functions can use certificates.
In version 28, you can use certificates coming from a buffer in memory, and not only from a file on disk.
	




 
	
		Encryption and signing: PEM and DER formats
	

	
		Signing or encryption functions can use different certificate formats.
In version 28, in addition to P12 certificates, the PEM and DER formats are also supported.
	




 
	
		Serial Ports: timeout
	

	
		In version 28, you can pass the timeout as a parameter.
	




 
	
		Invalid external descriptions (JSON, XML, etc.) now appear in compilation errors
	

	
		A project can include external descriptions, for example for JSON or XML data.
WLanguage natively recognizes the associated contents.
In version 28, a compilation error is shown if an external description is invalid.
	




 
	
		Associative array with key of type variant
	

	
		You can create associative arrays with a key of type Variant.
	




 
	
		Dynamic compilation: structures
	

	
		The dynamic compilation now allows you to create structures.
	




 
	
		Request UI refresh
	

	
		The [RequestRefreshUI](../WDLang1/1000023899.md) function triggers the refresh request event of a window.
This function allows you to easily group UI modification processes.
In version 28, this function has been improved:

- it can be used on Internal Windows.

- it takes parameters that it will pass to the Internal Window.

- it supports prefix syntax.



	




 
	
		Thread that calls the main thread: no longer blocked
	

	
		The new [ExecuteMainThreadAsynchronous](../WDLang1/1410088684.md) function is used to call the main thread without waiting for the response.
Procedure automations in the code editor also support this new option.
	



	


<a name="webservices"></a>

	
		WEBSERVICES
	

	
		 
	
		Runtime log
	

	
		SOAP and REST webservices created with WINDEV can generate execution logs on demand with the [dbgEnableLog](../WDLang1/1000017137.md) function.
These logs can be viewed later in the environment using the new Real-Time Performance Profiler.
	




 
	
		64-bit test mode
	

	
		You can test web services (via the GO icon) in 32 or 64-bit mode.
	




 
	
		Rest web service: natively call REST APIs in WLanguage (OpenAPI documentation)
	

	
		You can document REST web service APIs using an OpenAPl file.
This documentation file can be imported into the project: the code editor recognizes the APIs described in the file.
These APIs will be called "natively".
Named, optional and mandatory parameters are supported.
The response is returned in an httpResponse type that contains the return code and the body of the response.
You can handle particular cases with the httpRequest type.
Sample code for the Swagger Petstore web service: 

```wl
Dog is Pet
Dog.id = 745513
Dog.name = "Noopy"
// Add animal
'Swagger Petstore - OpenAPI 3.0'.addPet( Dog )
```

	




 
	
		Soap: Additional verifications when generating the web service
	

	
		

- Web services can return classes. In this case, the developer must check the "Export class" option in the web service generation wizard. If this option is left unchecked, the wizard highlights the error.

- If the type of the return value of a web service procedure is not specified, the compiler tries to determine this type. If the compiler cannot determine the type, the new "Strict mode" generates an error to encourage the developer to specify the type of this value.



	




 
	
		Miscellaneous
	

	
		

- When using SOAP web services, you can directly handle the array of structures returned by the web service procedure: no need to copy the arrays!

- HTTP Get requests can send data (contain a payload).



	



	


<a name="xml"></a>

	
		XML
	

	
		 
	
		XML import: compilation error if invalid syntax
	

	
		The code editor allows you to import XML files and use them natively in WLanguage.
When importing an XML file into a project, a compilation error appears if the file format is not correct: missing closing tag, etc. (See new feature 134).

		New "Note" attribute
	

	
		The new **Note** attribute allows you to specify details at class members level, and to access these details at runtime.
	




 
	
		Controls, windows and pages can implement interfaces (as in OOP)
	

	
		In OOP, an interface is a set of virtual methods to be implemented.
In version 28, all types of controls, windows, internal windows, pages and internal pages can implement interfaces.
	




 
	
		Scope of procedures: between "public" and "private", there is "restricted" (internal)
	

	
		In version 28, a new type of scope is available for procedures in WLanguage: the Restricted level (known as "Internal" in other programming languages).
In Restricted mode, the procedure is visible only to the other elements within the same assembly: same web service, same component, etc.
	




 
	
		Miscellaneous
	

	
		

- The Ancestor keyword can be called in global methods.

		COMPATIBILITY WITH THIRD-PARTY LANGUAGES
	

	
		 
	
		Python: protect your source code; execute precompiled scripts
	

	
		In version 28, you can execute precompiled Python scripts: this means you no longer need to provide the source Python code.
Therefore, your source code remains inaccessible to other users.
	




 
	
		Kotlin
	

	
		Kotlin is a programming language mainly used for Android development.
In version 28, Kotlin is natively supported in WINDEV Mobile.

This enables communication with devices that do not strictly comply with the Modbus standard.
	



	


<a name="hfsql_database"></a>

	
		HFSQL DATABASE
	

	
		 
	
		Nullable key
	

	
		In version 28, you can indicate that a key is "nullable", i.e., that it can contain the Null value.
Null is different from zero, or from an empty string.
Now, sorting operations differentiate zero from Null values.
	




 
	
		Primary key
	

	
		A primary key is a unique key that cannot be Null.
In version 28, you can define primary keys. For example, automatic identifiers are usually primary keys.
	




 
	
		HExecuteQueryAsynchronous is now faster
	

	
		The performance of the [HExecuteQueryAsynchronous](../WDLang4/1000026094.md) function has been significantly improved.
Processing is now faster.
	




 
	
		HTrack: don't block the application
	

	
		The [HTrack](../WDLang4/1000022407.md) function notifies an application when another application makes changes on a given data file.
A callback procedure is then called.
The UI is blocked while this procedure is executed. If this process takes a long time, it will have a negative impact on the UX.
In version 28, you can specify that the callback procedure must be executed in a secondary thread. Thus, the user won't be blocked.
	




 
	
		Docker and HFSQL: default password
	

	
		To securely set up a database using a Docker container, the password of the administrator must be specified.
You can still use an administrator account without a password. Simply specify this option in the Docker recipe.
	




 
	
		Simulate network speed
	

	
		The [HSimulateNetwork](../WDLang4/1000018954.md) function simulates the speed of a network when testing an application.
Version 28 includes modern types of networks:
3G, 4G, 5G, DSL, Fiber, Cloud, custom speed.
This allows the developer to test the speed of the application according to the type of connection available to the end user.
	




 
	
		Connection encryption: AES-256, AES-128, AES-192
	

	
		In version 28, the connections between client computers and the database server can be encrypted using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). These standards are added to the already available encryption standards.
	



	


<a name="sql_functions"></a>

	
		SQL FUNCTIONS
	

	
		 
	
		Add a PRIMARY KEY
	

	
		The new SQL ADD PRIMARY KEY INDEX function allows you to indicate that an item is primary key.
	




 
	
		Improved top, bottom and limit functions: up to 12 times faster
	

	
		The SQL TOP, BOTTOM and LIMIT functions have been optimized in version 28: They can be up to 12 times faster!
	




 
	
		Query with parameters: see the executed code
	

	
		A block of SQL code can contain parameters passed programmatically. The new SQLCodeExexecuted property gets the complete SQL code that was executed.
This allows you to copy/paste the code to check how it was executed, for example.
	




 
	
		3 New SQL functions
	

	
		3 new SQL functions are introduced in version 28:

- ADD PRIMARY KEY INDEX: Adds a primary key in an existing file.

- Optimize: Reindexes a file with the default parameters (hNdxNormal + hFTX + hBackgroundTask, 80% density).

- GROUP_CONCAT: Concatenates non-NULL strings from a list of values (MySQL statement).

		HFSQL SPARE
	

	
		 
	
		Select relevant folders
	

	
		HFSQL Spare is a near real-time server backup solution.
In version 28, you can select which subfolders of a database will be included in the backup.
This allows you to exclude folders whose content does not change (archives, log files, etc.) and thus reduce the amount of data to be transferred and stored.
	



	


<a name="hfsql_control_center"></a>

	
		HFSQL CONTROL CENTER
