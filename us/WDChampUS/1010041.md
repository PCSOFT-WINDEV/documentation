## Overview of menu
<a name="overview_menu_ELTTEXTE000237"></a>
In WEBDEV, you can create the following elements in HTML pages: 

- a drop-down menu.

- a context menu.
	




From the different options of these menus, you can: 

- display pages,

- execute the code of the buttons in the page,

- ...




In WEBDEV, a drop-down or context menu in a page is considered as a control. 

This control has its own style characteristics. In the case of a drop-down menu, it can be moved in the page. 

For more details, see [The Context Menu control](../WDChamp/1410087217.md).

### Style of a menu
<a name="style_menu_ELTPARAGRAPHE000131"></a>

The style of a WEBDEV menu is described in the "Style" tab of the description window of menu.

You have the ability to use, create and modify:

- the WEBDEV styles. In this case, the style sheet is modified.

- the aspect of the control. In this case, the control is not linked to the style sheet.




When describing the style of a WEBDEV menu, you have the ability to specify:

- The style of main menu: style of caption, ...

- The background image used for the main menu. 

- The style of submenus: caption, ...

- The image of submenus: background image and image of options that open a submenu.  

- The available effects for displaying the menu options. 




Remark: The ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Menu_Image_Editeur%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)
 button expands a menu used to select the images: 

- The "Browse" option is used to select an image file accessible from your computer. 

- The "Catalog" option is used to find (in the image catalog) the images corresponding to the menu options (search performed in the following categories: "Main menu", "Tab menu" and "Menu option").




**The available effects for displaying the menu options**

Several effects can be used to display the submenus of a menu. 

- expand and wipe (by default): When hovering the main option, the submenus are expanded with a sweeping effect until their final position. Click "Details" to configure the direction of the sweeping effect.  

- fade (by default): When hovering the main option, the submenus are expanded with a progressive change of the style defined for the normal status to the style defined for the rollover. Click "Details" to configure the trigger and the duration of the effect.  

- offset: During the rollover, the options of the submenu are expanded with an offset for each hovered option. Click "Details" to configure the trigger and the duration of the effect, as well as the offset according to the different axes.  ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Menu_WB_Decalage.gif)


- fast then slow: When hovering the main option, the submenus are expanded with a soft effect. Click "Details" to configure the duration of the animation.

- expand and stretch: When hovering the main option, the submenus are expanded with a stretched effect. Click "Details" to configure the duration of the animation.


**Remark**: The technology used for these effects is based on the CSS3 standard. Some browsers partially support the effects when the page is not in HTML 5 format. 

WEBDEV gives you the ability to: 

- add an effect: "Add an effect" button. 

- delete an effect: select the effect and click the "-" button. 

- organize the effects via the arrow buttons. 


Caution: Some effects are not compatible and they cannot be used at the same time.
