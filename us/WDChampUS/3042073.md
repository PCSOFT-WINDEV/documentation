## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000162"></a>
The Radar chart is used to highlight a series according to another one.

In a Radar chart, the number of axes is equal to the number of categories. All the axes are issued from the central point.

The categories are indicated around the chart. The values of series are displayed inside the chart.
