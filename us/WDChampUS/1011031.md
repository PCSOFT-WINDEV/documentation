![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) **WINDEV Mobile**: When running a test in the editor, all the options are available. However, when printing a report programmatically in an iOS, Android or Universal Windows app, you can only print to PDF files. **Remark**: By default, the print mode of the report is automatically requested during the test of each report in a specific window. If you do not want to see this window during the report test, check the "Do not show again" option in the print mode selection window. For more details, see [Do not show a message again](../Editeurs/2020011.md).
