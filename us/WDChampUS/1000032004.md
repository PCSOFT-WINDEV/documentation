## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000127"></a>
To handle a Rich Text Area control programmatically, use the variable of the Rich Text Area control directly in the code.

The variable of the Rich Text Area control corresponds to the name of the control.

## Initializing a Rich Text Area control
<a name="initializing_rich_text_area_control_ELTTEXTE000151"></a>
To initialize a Rich Text Area control, you can: 

- initialize the control with the HTML code. This allows you to format the control content through programming.
	For example: 
	
	```wl
	// Modify the Rich Text Area
	RTA_MODIFIABLE = "'''This section was " + ...
	 	"modified'''"
	```


- use [Value](../Proprietes/2510130.md) or [CaptionHTML](../Proprietes/1000020922.md).

### Modifying one or more elements in a Rich Text Area control
<a name="modifying_one_more_elements_rich_text_area_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000037"></a>

A Rich Text Area control can contain links or images. To modify the information regarding a link or an image found in the control, all you have to do is handle the requested element through programming. 

For example, a Rich Text Area control contains a link and an image. The caption and the URL of the link change, depending on whether the Web user is connected or not. Similarly, the image displayed is different. In this case, all you have to do is directly handle the Link and Image controls. 


```wl
// Modify the link and the image found in the RTA_Home control
IF bConnected = True THEN
	LINK_Connection.Caption = "Disconnect"
	LINK_Connection.URL = "www.mysite.fr"
	IMG_Logo = "User_Logo.gif"
ELSE
	LINK_Connection.Caption = "Connect"
	LINK_Connection.URL = "www.mysite.fr\Login.htm"
	IMG_Logo = "Logo.gif"
END
```

## Retrieving the value of a Rich Text Area control
<a name="retrieving_the_value_rich_text_area_control_ELTTEXTE000181"></a>
To retrieve the content of a Rich Text Area control:

- perform a simple assignment. For example:
	
	```wl
	CurrentContent = RTA_Overview
	```


- handle the Rich Text Area control directly. For example:
	
	```wl
	Trace(RTA_Overview)
	```


- use the [Value](../Proprietes/2510130.md) or [CaptionHTML](../Proprietes/1000020922.md) properties.




Remark: The retrieved text corresponds to the HTML code of the control.
