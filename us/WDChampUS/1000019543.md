## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000139"></a>
New Scheduler controls can be directly linked to the data. You can create: 

- a **Scheduler control based on a data file**: the Scheduler control will be linked to a data file or query. In this case, the data file contains the characteristics of the appointments. 

- a **Scheduler control based on a variable**: the Scheduler control will be linked to a variable (usually a class instance). In this case, the class lists the appointments with their characteristics. 




This makes programming Scheduler controls easier.

### Creating a Scheduler control based on a data file
<a name="creating_scheduler_control_based_data_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000020"></a>

To create a Scheduler control based on a data file, you can: 

- use the Scheduler control creation wizard. To do so, select "Display data from a file or existing query". Answer the questions in the wizard and validate. 

- change the description of the Scheduler control. 




To change the characteristics of an existing Scheduler control:

1. Open the control description window (select "Description" in the context menu). 

2. In the "Content" tab, select "File", and then select the desired data source. This data source can be: 

	- a data file defined in the analysis, 

	- a query of the project, 

	- a query included in the window or page. 




3. Bind the different items of the data source to the characteristics of the appointment. The elements preceded by a star are mandatory. 
	**Remark**: If the associated data file does not directly contain the corresponding item, you can set a multi-file link. 

4. Validate the description window of the Scheduler control. The Scheduler control is now based on a data file. 







### Creating a Scheduler control based on a variable

To create a Scheduler control based on a variable, you can: 

- use the Scheduler control creation wizard. To do so, select "Display data from an existing variable". Answer the questions in the wizard and validate. 

- change the description of the Scheduler control. 




To change the characteristics of an existing Scheduler control:

1. Open the control description window (select "Description" in the context menu). 

2. In the "Content" tab, select "Variable", and then select the desired data source (class, etc.). 

3. Bind the different elements (class members, for example) of the data source to the characteristics of the appointment. The elements preceded by a star are mandatory. 

4. Validate the description window of the Scheduler control. The Scheduler control is now based on a variable. 








## Handling a Scheduler control based on a data file or variable

### Scheduler control based on a data file

Scheduler controls based on a data file are very easy to handle: 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) If the user handles the scheduler via the context menu (to add, delete or modify appointments, for example), the associated data file is automatically updated with the changes made in the control. 

- If the user handles the appointments via a specific window or page, it is necessary to directly modify the data file linked to the Scheduler control. The displayed data will be automatically updated. It is also possible to use [SchedulerDisplay](../WDLang1/1000019426.md) to update the data displayed in the control. 




**Remark**: If the control is bound to a data source, the data deleted in the control is also deleted from the data source.
