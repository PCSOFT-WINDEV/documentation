### Reorganizing the blocks
<a name="reorganizing_the_blocks_ELTPARAGRAPHE000088"></a>The report editor allows you to reorganize the blocks found in a report. When printing the report, the blocks will be printed according to the order specified in the report editor. The order in which the processes of the blocks are run corresponds to the order in which the blocks are printed.
To reorganize the report blocks:

1. Open the report description window ("Report description" in the context menu of the report). 

2. Display the "Blocks" tab.

3. Modify the print order of the blocks:

**Remark**: The print order of the blocks can also be modified in the description window of each block ("Block description" from the popup menu of the block).


### Special case: reorder the iteration blocks
<a name="special_case_reorder_the_iteration_blocks_ELTPARAGRAPHE000103"></a>

By Default, the display order of the iteration blocks in an report corresponds to the creation order of these blocks. 

To reorder the iteration blocks of an report:

1. Open the report description window ("Report description" in the context menu of the report). 

2. Display the "Blocks" tab.

3. Select the name of the iteration block to be modified and use the "Move block up" and "Move block down" buttons. 
	Remark: These options are also available in the popup menu in the block.
