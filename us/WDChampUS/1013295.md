## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000255"></a>
In a mobile application, several options can be handled with the fingers, by performing specific movements. 

For the Looper controls, WINDEV Mobile proposes several options used to manage these moves and gestures. These options can be configured in the "Details" tab of the description window of Looper control.

### Action during a swipe
<a name="action_during_swipe_ELTPARAGRAPHE000085"></a>

On the Looper controls, an action can be performed during a horizontal swipe of a row (drag the element from right to left or from left to right). 

You have the ability to perform: 

- an automatic deletion. 




**Automatic deletion**
If the "Automatic deletion" option is selected, new events are associated with the Looper control: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| Before automatically deleting a row by swipe | This event is run before the automatic deletion of the record displayed in the row. This event is used to run different tests for example. If this event returns <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> the deletion is not performed. |
| After automatic deletion of a row by swipe | This event is run after the actual deletion of the record. This event is used, for example, to re-display the data. |
|   | This event is run BEFORE the event "Before automatically deleting a row". If this event returns <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>, the event "Before automatically deleting a row" is not run and the record is not deleted. |


Remark: Only the data file record linked to the row of the Looper control is deleted. The linked records found in the other data files are not automatically deleted. 


Use conditions:

- Row swipe actions are only available for Looper controls populated programmatically or with in-memory data source. 

- Swipe actions are not available for horizontal and multicolumn Looper controls. 

- Swipe actions are available in the simulator.
