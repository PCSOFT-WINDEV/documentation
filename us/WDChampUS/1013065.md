## Overview

A Looper control populated programmatically is directly linked to lists stored in memory. It automatically manages advanced mechanisms for handling lists.

One Looper control populated programmatically corresponds to multiple lists used in parallel. Therefore:

- adding or inserting a row into the Looper control performs an insertion into all the attributes/controls.

- deleting a row from the Looper control performs a deletion from all the attributes/controls.




The content of the Looper control must be initialized by programming.
