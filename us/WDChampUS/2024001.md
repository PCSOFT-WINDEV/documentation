## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000185"></a>
Your report displays controls that overlap?

You want to find out the Z-order position of your controls: which controls are displayed in the foreground?

The two-dimensional display soon becomes inadequate for this type of operation.

WINDEV gives you a spatial view of a report by allowing you to view the report in three dimensions. The Z-order position of the report controls is immediately visible. A control selected in this display mode remains selected when the mode goes back to two dimensions.

You have the ability to choose the best view angle via the mouse and via the keyboard keys.

**Caution**: a specific configuration is required to use this feature. For more details, see Remarks.
