## Showing the controls and the blocks via a border
<a name="showing_the_controls_and_the_blocks_via_border_ELTTEXTE000515"></a>
The report editor allows you to quickly view all the controls and blocks found in the current report. 

You can: 

- frame the controls and blocks with a simple line. This line appears in edit mode only. This line is not visible at runtime.
	This border is used to easily view the area occupied by the controls and blocks found in a report (especially for the image controls).

- show the corners of the controls and blocks. This view mode, lighter than a line, allows you to quickly view the different areas.

- use no specific view mode. 


To change the display mode in the current report, go to the "Display" tab, "View" group, and select the requested display mode: 

- Corners

- Full border

- None


The F7 key is used to dynamically modify the display mode.

Another solution:

1. On the "Modification" tab, click the dialog box launcher (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_regroup.gif)
) of the "Options" group.

2. Display the "Display" tab if necessary.

1. On the "Display" tab, click the dialog box launcher (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_regroup.gif)
) of the "Options" group.

2. Open the "Preferences" tab if necessary.
