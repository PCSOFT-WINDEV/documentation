## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000232"></a>
WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile include multiple methods to filter the records displayed in a Table control based on a data file:

- Filter on the search key, defined in the description window of the Table control.

- [Filter](../Proprietes/2510042.md) property.

- [HFilter](../WDLang4/3044100.md) function.

- Optional event for filtering the records of a Table control. For more details, see [Events associated with Table controls](../WDChamp/1013189.md).

## Describing the Table control

The "Display the records whose browse item starts with" option allows you to set a filter on a Table control based on a data file.

The filter has the following characteristics:

- "Starts with" filter. The condition is directly entered in the editor.

- The filter is only applied to Table controls based on a data file.

- The filter does not affect how the data file is read ([HReadFirst](../WDLang4/3044051.md), etc.)

If "Use HFilter to browse the file" is unchecked, the filter will have the following characteristics:

- "Starts with" filter. The condition is directly entered in the editor.

- The filter is only applied to Table controls based on a data file. 

- The filter does not affect how the data file is read ([HReadFirst](../WDLang4/3044051.md), etc.)

- Only the column bound to the browse item can be sorted ("Sortable" option in the "General tab").

- The user will not be able to perform searches in the Table control ("Magnifier (search/filter)" option in the "General" tab).

### "Use HFilter to browse the file" option checked
<a name="use_hfilter_browse_the_file_option_checked_ELTPARAGRAPHE000100"></a>

If "Use HFilter to browse the file" is checked, the filter will have the following characteristics:

- "Starts with" filter. The condition is directly entered in the editor.

- The filter is only applied to Table controls based on a data file.

- The filter does not affect how the data file is read ([HReadFirst](../WDLang4/3044051.md), etc.)

- The user will be able to sort the data displayed in the columns bound to key items ("Sortable" option in the "General" tab).

- The user will be able to perform searches in the columns bound to key items ("Magnifier (search/filter)" option in the "General" tab).




**Special case**: Before opening the window that contains the Table control, if a filter was set with [HFilter](../WDLang4/3044100.md) on the file the control is based on, the Table control will automatically filter the records displayed (filter defined directly in the editor or via the [Filter](../Proprietes/2510042.md) property). When the window is closed, no filters will be enabled on the data file.

**Caution**: Check the active filter when looping through data files. As two filters cannot be enabled at the same time, only the last filter created by [HFilter](../WDLang4/3044100.md) is kept.

## Filter property
<a name="filter_property_ELTTEXTE000292"></a>
The [Filter](../Proprietes/2510042.md) property can be used to dynamically set the characteristics of the filter applied to the Table control.
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) The filter applied uses the "Use HFilter to browse the file" option defined in the editor.

## HFilter
<a name="hfilter_ELTTEXTE000316"></a>
[HFilter](../WDLang4/3044100.md) filters the base file of the Table control. [HFilter](../WDLang4/3044100.md) allows you to use all types of filters (including the "Starts with" filters).

If [HFilter](../WDLang4/3044100.md) is not used in the initialization code of the Table control, it is necessary to redisplay the contents of the Table control using [TableDisplay](../WDLang1/3074003.md).

**Remark**: Table controls based on a data file that are populated automatically (by WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile) are not yet populated when the initialization code is executed. The records can be filtered with [HFilter](../WDLang4/3044100.md).
