## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000178"></a>
To display a report in HTML format in the browser of the Web user, you must:

- generate the HTML file on the Web server.

- display the generated file in the browser of Web user. The display of the file can be:

	- immediate.

	- requested by the web user (click performed on a link for example).




- delete the HTML file from the Web server.

### Generating an HTML file on the Web server
<a name="generating_html_file_the_web_server_ELTPARAGRAPHE000025"></a>

To generate an HTML file on the Web server:

1. Create a unique name for the HTML file to generate. The creation directory of this file must be accessible in read/write (the directory of the data files or the "&lt;MyProject&gt;_WEB" directory of the site for example). 
	For details on how to create a unique file name, see [Defining a unique name for the generated file](../WDChamp/1011009.md).

2. If the report contains images, specify that these images must be generated in the "&lt;MyProject&gt;_WEB" directory of the site ([iDirImageHTML](../WDLang5/3046078.md)).

3. Configure the print destination with [iDestination](../WDLang5/3046074.md) associated with the *iHTML* constant (print in an HTML file).

4. Specify the name of the report to print in [iPrintReport](../WDLang5/3046032.md). 
	The HTML file is created on the Web server.

### Displaying the HTML file
<a name="displaying_the_html_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000053"></a>

The display of the file can be:

- immediate.

- requested by the web user (click performed on a link for example).




To automatically display the generated file in the browser of the Web user, you must:

1. Extract the name and extension of the generated file with [fExtractPath](../WDLang1/3036026.md).

2. Display the generated file in the browser of the Web user with [FileDisplay](../WDLang2/3012005.md) or [PageDisplay](../WDLang2/3058008.md).




To display the generated file upon request, you must:

1. Extract the name and extension of the generated file with [fExtractPath](../WDLang1/3036026.md).

2. Display the generated file in the browser of web user. You can for example:

	- use [FileDisplay](../WDLang2/3012005.md) or [PageDisplay](../WDLang2/3058008.md).

	- modify the URL of the control that displays the HTML file ([URL](../Proprietes/2510132.md) property of a button or link for example).

### Deleting an HTML file
<a name="deleting_html_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000098"></a>

To reduce the size occupied by the reports in HTML format on the Web server, we recommend that you delete the useless reports on a regular basis. You can create a procedure used to delete all the reports created during the day for example.

**Caution**: Don't delete the report immediately after [FileDisplay](../WDLang2/3012005.md) or [PageDisplay](../WDLang2/3058008.md). The generated HTML file must exist in order to be viewed on the browser of the Web user.

## Example
<a name="example_ELTTEXTE000238"></a>
The "RPT_InvoiceHTML" report is displayed in HTML format on the computer of the Web user.

The "ShowInvoice" button is used to:

- generate the HTML file in the "&lt;MyProject&gt;_WEB" directory of the site.

- view the report in HTML format.




In this example, the server click code of the "ShowInvoice" button is as follows:


```wl
// Generate a unique HTML file name
FilePath is string  
FilePath = fWebDir() + "\" + DateSys() + TimeSys() + ".htm"
// Configure the destination of the print 
iDestination(iHTML, FilePath) 
// Print the RPT_InvoiceHTML report 
iPrintReport(RPT_InvoiceHTML) 
// Extract the name and extension of the generated file
FileName is string
FileName = fExtractPath(FilePath, fFile + fExtension)
// Send the file to the browser 
PageDisplay(FileName)
```


**Remark**: The HTML file can be directly opened from a button or from a link. Simply change the control action with the [URL](../Proprietes/2510132.md) property:


```wl
// Generate a unique HTML file name
FilePath is string  
FilePath = fWebDir() + "\" + DateSys() + TimeSys() + ".htm"
// Configure the destination of the print
iDestination(iHTML, FilePath) 
// Print the RPT_InvoiceHTML report
iPrintReport(RPT_InvoiceHTML) 
// Extract the name and extension of the generated file
FileName is string  
FileName = fExtractPath(FilePath, fFile + fExtension)
// Modify the action of the Link control that will open the HTML file
LINK_HTMLLink.URL = "/" + FolderWeb() + "/" + FileName
```
