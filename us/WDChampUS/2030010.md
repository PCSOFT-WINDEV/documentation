## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000102"></a>
The home page is the first page of your WEBDEV site (static or in session mode). This page is always a static page.

In a site in session mode, the home page is one of the elements used to reference the site.

You have the ability to choose a static page found in your site.

## Defining the home page
<a name="defining_the_home_page_ELTTEXTE000126"></a>
WEBDEV allows you to define the home page of a site via the "Project explorer" pane.

**Remark**: A home page is also proposed during the test of a static project, if no home page was defined. For more details, see [Testing a project](../Editeurs/2019003.md).

To define the home page of the project:

1. In the "Project explorer" pane, select the page that will become the new home page. This page must be a static page of your site.

2. Select "Home page" in the context menu. This option is available only if the selected page is a static page.

3. The corresponding HTML page is automatically generated and the home page is defined. The ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_accueil.gif)
 icon is used to identify the home page in the "Project explorer" pane.

## Created files corresponding to the home page
<a name="created_files_corresponding_the_home_page_ELTTEXTE000156"></a>
When a home page is defined for your static site or your site in session mode, the following files are automatically created in the &lt;Project Name&gt;_WEB directory as well as in each language subdirectory:

- Home.htm

- Default.htm

- Index.htm




When installing a WEBDEV site, this page will be used as the first page of the site. The address for starting the site will have to start this page.
