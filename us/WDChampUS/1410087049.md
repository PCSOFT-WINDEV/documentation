## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000143"></a>
A Layout control can be handled programmatically. The following elements can also be handled programmatically: 

- the controls in the Layout control,

- the cells in the Layout control. 




This help page presents the different operations that can be performed.

### Making a control invisible
<a name="making_control_invisible_ELTPARAGRAPHE000020"></a>

To dynamically make a control in a Layout control visible or invisible, simply use the [Visible](../Proprietes/2510138.md) property in the following syntax: 

```txt
Control name>.Visible = <True/False
```

**Remark: Layout control in "push surrounding controls" mode**: 
The cell in the Layout control is automatically made invisible and the other cells in the Layout control are automatically repositioned if the following conditions are met: 

- a control in a Layout control is invisible,

- this control is the only one in a cell or all the controls in the cell of the Layout control are invisible.  




Remarks: 

- If all the controls in a Layout control are hidden, the Layout control is also hidden. 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) The [VisibleWithAnimation](../Proprietes/1410087232.md) property makes a Layout control visible or invisible by playing an animation.





### Making a cell found in a Layout control invisible
<a name="making_cell_found_layout_control_invisible_ELTPARAGRAPHE000055"></a>

To dynamically make a cell in a Layout control visible or invisible, simply use the [Visible](../Proprietes/2510138.md) property in the following syntax: 

```txt
<Control name>[Cell index].Visible = <True/False>
```

**Remark: Layout control in "push surrounding controls" mode**: 
If a cell found in a Layout control is made invisible, all controls found in the cell are automatically made invisible: the other cells found in the Layout control are automatically repositioned. 

Remarks: 

- If all the cells in a Layout control are hidden, the Layout control is also hidden. 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) The [VisibleWithAnimation](../Proprietes/1410087232.md) property makes the cells in a Layout control visible or invisible by playing an animation.

### Available properties
<a name="available_properties_ELTPARAGRAPHE000089"></a>The following properties are specific to the Layout control: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [HeightWithAnimation](../Proprietes/1410087234.md) | The **HeightWithAnimation** property is used to modify the height of a cell of a Layout control with the "Resize cell" animation defined: <br><br>- in the "Advanced" tab of the project description window ("Control animation" button). <br><br>- in the "Style" tab of the control or project.<br><br><br> |
| [Layout](../Proprietes/1000023391.md) | The **Layout** property is used to get the layout of the cells in a Layout control. |
| [MarginInterCell](../Proprietes/1000023413.md) | The **MarginInterCell** property is used to: <br><br>- find out the margin between rows or columns in a Layout control. <br><br>- modify the margin between rows or columns in a Layout control. <br><br><br> |
| [VisibleWithAnimation](../Proprietes/1410087232.md) | The **VisibleWithAnimation** property is used to make a control visible or invisible via the "Appear/Disappear" animation. |
| [WidthWithAnimation](../Proprietes/1410087240.md) | The **WidthWithAnimation** property is used to modify the width of a cell of a Layout control with the "Resize cell" animation defined: <br><br>- in the "Advanced" tab of the project description window ("Control animation" button). <br><br>- in the "Style" tab of the control or project.<br><br><br> |
