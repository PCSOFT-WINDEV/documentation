<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000162"></a>
Rich text supports multiple advanced features: font, weight, size, color, attribute, ...

You can use rich text in many controls:

- Edit

- Combo Box

- List Box

- Check Box

- Radio Button

- Link




The rich text can correspond to: 

- the caption of control.
