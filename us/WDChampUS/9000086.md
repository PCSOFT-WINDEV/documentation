## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000421"></a>
WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile allow you to create window templates. These templates contain the graphic elements and code common to all the windows in your application.

Changes made to a window template are automatically applied to all the windows that use the template.

Window templates allow you to keep the style book defined for an application.

Using window templates in your applications allows you to:

- create windows more easily.

- set the layout of the windows.

- easily update the application style book.

## Creating a window template
<a name="creating_window_template_ELTTEXTE000445"></a>
A window template can be created:

- directly, like any other window.

- from an existing window.

### Creating a window template
<a name="creating_window_template_ELTPARAGRAPHE000062"></a>

To create a window template:

1. Create a new window template: 

	- Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_nouveau.gif)
 in the quick access buttons. 

	- The new element window appears: click "Window" then "Window template".




2. You can:

	- Create a blank window template (based or not on the skin template used by the project), 

	- Create a blank window template based on a skin template other than the one of the project, 

	- Create a window template based on another window template of the project, if your project already uses window templates. In this case, you will have the ability to perform cascading updates of the window templates.




3. The window editor displays a new window within an orange frame with the "Window template" title.

4. Create all the necessary controls. These controls will be included in all the windows that use the template.

5. Enter (if necessary):

	- the events associated with the window.

	- the events associated with the different controls of the template.
			These events will be automatically imported into the windows that use the template.




6. Give your template a name ("General" tab of the description window).

7. On the "Home" tab, in the "General" group, click "Save" (or click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_Enregistrer.gif)
 in the quick access buttons).

The window template is a file with the ".WDT" extension.

### Creating a window template from an existing window
<a name="creating_window_template_from_existing_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000108"></a>

To create a window template from an existing window: 

1. Open the window chosen as template.

2. Keep the controls required by the template. These controls will be included in all the windows that use the window template.

3. Keep only the code of the events required by the template. These events will be automatically imported into the windows that use the template.

4. Give a name to your window ("General" tab in the description window of the window).

5. On the "Home" tab, in the "General" group, click "Save" and select "Save as template". The current window becomes a template:

	- its name is preceded by "Template".

	- an orange border appears around the window in the window editor.

	- the window template appears in the "Project explorer" pane, under "Window templates".







The window template is a file with the ".WDT" extension.

	- the menus of the template are not applied to the window that is using the template.




- The status bars cannot be overloaded.
