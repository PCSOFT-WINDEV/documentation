## Events managed by default (window control)
<a name="events_managed_default_window_control_ELTTEXTE000302"></a>
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile manage the following events by default (order of appearance in the code editor):

| Event | Runtime condition |
| --- | --- |
| Initializing | Run when the window is opened. \* |
| Before creating the appointment | Run when selecting "New appointment" in the context menu of Organizer control. |
| Entry in edit in an appointment | Run when selecting "New appointment" in the context menu of Organizer control. This event is run immediately after the event "Before creating the appointment". |
| Exit from input for the appointment | Run when exiting the input of an appointment (e.g., exit when adding an appointment or when editing an appointment via the context menu) |
| Selecting an appointment | Run when selecting an existing appointment in the Organizer control. This event is executed when the popup menu opens. |
| Moving an appointment | Run when moving an appointment in the Organizer control (move performed with the mouse for example). |
| Resizing an appointment | Run when resizing an appointment in the Organizer control (resize operation performed with the mouse for example). |
| Deleting an appointment | Run when selecting "Delete the appointment" in the context menu of Organizer control. |
| Range selection | Run when selecting a time range in the Organizer control. |
| Whenever changing period | Run when modifying the period displayed in the Organizer control. |
| Whenever changing the display mode | Run when the user changes the display mode of Organizer control. The new mode can be known in this event via [OrganizerMode](../WDLang1/1000019545.md). |


(\*) By default, the "Initializing" event of each control is run according to the order in which the controls were created in the window. To modify this order of execution: 

1. On the "Window" tab, in the "Order" group, click "Initialization".

2. In the window displayed, use the arrows on the right to modify the order in which the controls are initialized.





### Events with procedures for quick use
<a name="events_with_procedures_for_quick_use_ELTPARAGRAPHE000182"></a>

Most of the events associated with the Organizer control are run: 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) when using the context menu of the Organizer control. 

- when using the mouse or the fingertips.




To simplify the operations performed on the appointments of an Organizer control, several procedures are proposed in each event. These procedures take the appointment variable ([Appointment](../WDLang1/1000019244.md) variable) as parameter. All the characteristics of the appointment handled by the popup menu, by the mouse or fingertips are automatically assigned to this variable. 

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) **Example**: To store an appointment added by the user via the popup menu in an APT data file, simply write the following in the event "Entry in edit in an appointment": 


```wl
PROCEDURE Edit(aptEdited is Appointment)

// Store the data
APT.Title = aptEdited.Title
APT.StartDate = aptEdited.StartDate
APT.EndDate = aptEdited.EndDate
...
HAdd(APT)
```



### Advanced use of events with procedure
<a name="advanced_use_events_with_procedure_ELTPARAGRAPHE000206"></a>

You can also allow the user to define more precisely the characteristics of his appointment during an addition or a modification. 

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) To do so, create a window with the information to specify. 

In the code, simply open the window in the event "Entry in edit in an appointment". To lock the direct input via the context menu of the Organizer control, the event must return <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>. 

This principle can be applied to all the events called by the context menu of the Organizer control. 

Example: 


```wl
PROCEDURE Edit(aptEdited is Appointment)

// Opens the window for entering an appointment 
// with the selected appointment (in Creation or Modification mode)
Open(WIN_InputAPT_HFSQL, aptEdited)

// Returns False to lock the direct input in the Organizer control
RESULT False
```

## Optional events
<a name="optional_events_ELTTEXTE000344"></a>
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Several optional events are supported.
To add an optional event:

1. Select the desired control.

2. Display the code window of this control (F2 key).

3. Click the link "Add other events to xxx" at the bottom of the window code, after the last event.  ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Traitements_optionnels_WD_OK%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)


4. All the optional events available for the control are displayed. 

5. Check the optional event to add and validate. 
	Remark: You can select several optional events. 

6. The selected optional event is automatically added to the events managed by the control.




To disable an optional event, simply perform the same operations to display the list of optional events. Then simply uncheck the optional events to delete. 
Remark: If the disabled code contains WLanguage code, this code is automatically deleted.You can manage, for example:

- the mouse hover over the control,

- left mouse button down, up, with a double click,

- right mouse button down, up, double click, 

- mouse wheel, etc.
