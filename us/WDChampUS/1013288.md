## How to run a specific process when the header of a column in a Table control is clicked on?
<a name="how_run_specific_process_when_the_header_column_table_control_clicked_ELTTEXTE000086"></a>
To run a specific process when a column of a Table control is clicked on: 

1. Intercepting the event in the initialization code of the Table control:
	
	```wl
	// Table control "Initializing" event: 
	Event("CLICK_COLUMN_HEADER", "TABLE1", 1529)
	```

	In this code, "TABLE1" corresponds to the name of the Table control.

2. Procedure used to intercept the click on the column header. In this procedure, you have the ability to retrieve the number of the column that was clicked by the user.
	
	```wl
	// Code of CLICK_COLUMN_HEADER procedure
	PROCEDURE CLICK_COLUMN_HEADER()
	Trace("We've clicked the header of column # " + _Eve.wParam)
	
	// <Your specific process>
	```



**Remarks**: 

- To create a local procedure from the code editor, go to the "Code" tab, "Procedures" group, expand "New" and select "New local procedure".

- The procedure can prevent the column from being sorted if necessary. To do so, simply insert the following line of code:
	
	```wl
	_Eve.Return = 0
	```
