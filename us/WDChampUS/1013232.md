## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000149"></a>
WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile allow you to handle a Slider control through programming. To do so, use the variable of the Slider control in the code.

The variable of the Slider control:

- corresponds to the name of the slider.

- is initialized with the position of the slider cursor.




<a name="NOTE2"></a>
<a name="NOTE2_1"></a>


## Retrieving the cursor position
<a name="retrieving_the_cursor_position_ELTTEXTE000173"></a>
To retrieve the position of a slider, use the following syntax:


```txt
<Position> = <Slider Name>
```


&lt;Position&gt; is an integer variable

**Remark**: You can also use the [Value](../Proprietes/2510130.md) property.

<a name="NOTE3"></a>
<a name="NOTE3_1"></a>


## Modifying the cursor position
<a name="modifying_the_cursor_position_ELTTEXTE000197"></a>
To modify the position of a slider, use the following syntax:


```txt
<Slider Name> = <Value>
```


&lt;Value&gt; is a value included between the minimum value and the maximum value of the slider. These values have been defined in the control description window or in the code with the [MinValue](../Proprietes/2510008.md) and [MaxValue](../Proprietes/2510009.md) properties.

**Remark**: You can also use the [Value](../Proprietes/2510130.md) property.

<a name="NOTE4"></a>
<a name="NOTE4_1"></a>

| [ImageState](../Proprietes/2510055.md) | Used to find out and modify the number of drawings found in the image associated with the cursor image in a standard slider. |
| [MaxValue](../Proprietes/2510009.md) | Used to find out and modify the upper bound of a slider. |
| [MinValue](../Proprietes/2510008.md) | Used to find out and modify the lower bound of a slider. |
