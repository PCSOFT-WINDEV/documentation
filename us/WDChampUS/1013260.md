## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000198"></a>
The HTML table is a control used to easily create specific layouts in the HTML pages. The HTML table cannot be used to position the controls but it allows you to present the information.

For example, the HTML tables enable you to create enumerations with borders and columns.
