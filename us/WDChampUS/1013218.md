### Control found in a window, page or report
<a name="control_found_window_page_report_ELTPARAGRAPHE000011"></a>

The Image control is used to:

- Display static images or animated images in your applications.

- Draw.

- Display charts created with the chart designer. However, we recommend that you use a [Chart control](../WDChamp/1013006.md).

- Run specific processes when the user clicks the image (equivalent to the click areas of WINDEV 5.5).

- Display videos with [MCI functions](../WDLang1/3051010.md).

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) [Display PDF files](../WDChamp/9500147.md). 
	![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) This feature requires the [GDI+ framework](../Editeurs/2020007.md).

<a name="window_page_ELTPARAGRAPHE000105"></a>

To create an Image control in a window or page: 

1. On the "Creation" tab, in the "Usual controls" group, click "Image".

2. Click where the control will be created in the window or page. The control appears in the editor.




**To view the control characteristics**, select "Description" in the context menu of the control. The main available options are presented:

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png)![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) in [Image control in a window](../WDChamp/9500147.md). 




**To edit the image of an Image control**, select "Edit image" in the popup menu. The image editor is automatically started. For more details, see [Image editor](../Editeurs/1410086603.md).

## Multilingual images
<a name="multilingual_images_ELTTEXTE000304"></a>
If your application is a multilingual application, a different image can be selected for each language. This option is useful for images with text, for example.

To manage multilingual images: 

1. Open the description of the Image control, "General" tab. 

2. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Menu_Image_Editeur%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)
, then select "Multilingual". The window for managing multilingual images is displayed. By default, the same file is associated with all languages supported by the window, page or report.

3. For each language, click the ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Menu_Image_Editeur%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)
 button, "Browse" option, and select the image corresponding to the language. At runtime, the corresponding image will be displayed according to the language selected by [Nation](../WDLang1/3054014.md).




**Caution**: Only the image files are managed by the multilingual feature, not the display characteristics of image.

**Remark**: If a multilingual image was defined, the "&lt;Multilingual value&gt;" message is displayed in the area corresponding to the name of the image file in the description window of the Image control.
