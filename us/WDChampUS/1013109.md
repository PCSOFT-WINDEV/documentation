### Control found in a window, page or report
<a name="control_found_window_page_report_ELTPARAGRAPHE000011"></a>

The Bar Code control allows you to easily display bar codes in your windows, pages or reports. 

The value of a Bar Code control corresponds to an alphanumeric string.

**Caution**: To directly read the value of a bar code on the screen with a special device, make sure that you use the appropriate device.

## Creating a Bar Code control
<a name="creating_bar_code_control_ELTTEXTE000251"></a>
To create a Bar Code control: 

1. On the "Creation" tab: 

	- in the window editor or in the page editor: in the "Graphic controls" group, click "Bar code".

	- in the report editor: in the "Data" group, click "Bar code".




2. Click the position where the control must be created in the window, page or report. The control appears in the editor.




To view the characteristics of the control, select "Description" in the context menu. You now have the ability to choose the type of bar code ("General" tab). This type cannot be modified by programming.

**Tip**: you can also create a "pre-formatted" edit control by expanding the "Bar code" option. The list of available types of bar code with their preview in the skin template of the project comes up. Simply click the control you want to create in the editor. 


### Remark: QR code size
<a name="remark_code_size_ELTPARAGRAPHE000095"></a>

A QR code is a dot matrix whose size varies according to the data contained and the correction rate. 

The QR code management standard requires all dots to be the same size. 

To remain readable, the size of the QR code is not always proportional to the size of the control. From one QR Code to another, a margin within the control may appear to make sure that the code complies with the standard and that it can be read.

**The window editor or the page editor** is used to select:

- the type of bar code to display (with its characteristics if necessary).

	- Bar codes with check: The last character of the bar code corresponds to a control character.

	- Extended bar code: The value of the bar code can contain the 128 characters found in the ASCII code.

	- Proportional size: The height of the bar code is proportional to its width (for the UPC and EAN types).

	- Value of bar code visible: Displays (or not) the value of the bar code below its drawing.
			To find out the different types of bar codes supported by WINDEV, WINDEV Mobile or WEBDEV, see [The different types of bar codes](../WDLang5/3046064.md).




- the orientation and position of the bar code ("Details" tab).

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) the border of the bar code ("Style" tab of the window editor).




**The report editor** is used to specify:

- the initial value of the bar code. For example, you have the ability to type the Internet address linked to a QR bar code. 

- the type of bar code to display (with its specific features if necessary).

	- With check: The last character of the bar code corresponds to a control character.

	- Extended code: The value of the bar code can contain the 128 characters found in the ASCII code.

	- Value of bar code visible: Displays (or not) the value of the bar code below its drawing.

	- Proportional size: The height of the bar code is proportional to its width (for the UPC and EAN types).

	- Ignore the formatting characters: Ignores the brackets in a 128 or EAN-128 bar code.

	- The value contains control characters: Bar code containing control characters (valid for the CODE 128, DATAMATRIX, EAN 128 and PDF 417 bar codes only). By default, the control characters are enclosed between the "&lt;" and "&gt;" characters. In order for these characters not to be interpreted as control characters, they must be doubled.

	- Sets of characters: Bar code that uses one or more sets of characters in order to compress the bar code. This set of characters must be defined in the value of bar code.

	- Check characters: Bar code containing check characters (valid for the CODE 128, DATAMATRIX, EAN 128 and PDF 417 bar codes).
