## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000111"></a>
A "multi-touch" feature is a technique allowing the user to interact with a device via several contact points (the fingers are used in most cases). 

One of the most common applications of the multi-touch feature is used to handle images. The display size on a phone being reduced, it is often necessary to perform a zoom and/or to move in an image. 

This technology allows you to zoom images with a pinch gesture. 

WINDEV Mobile allows you to manage the multi-touch in the Android and iPhone/iPad applications via: 

- [Special options available for Image controls](../WDChamp/9500131.md).

- [Specific WLanguage functions](#NOTE2_1).

## Multi-touch: Specific WLanguage functions
<a name="multitouch_specific_wlanguage_functions_ELTTEXTE000135"></a>
Several WLanguage functions can be used to manage the multi-touch in the following processes of controls: 

- Pressed/Left button down (optional process)

- Released/Left button up (optional process)

- Tap/Click

- Double tap/Double click with left button (optional process)

- Move (optional process). 




These functions are: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [GestureCurrentPointer](../WDLang1/1000019751.md) | Returns the pointer index (finger or stylus) that triggered the call to a process specific to the multi-touch feature in an Image control. |
| [GestureNbPointer](../WDLang1/1000019750.md) | Returns the number of pointers in contact with the screen. |
| [GesturePosX](../WDLang1/1000019741.md) | Returns the horizontal position of the pointer (finger or stylus). |
| [GesturePosY](../WDLang1/1000019745.md) | Returns the vertical position of the pointer (finger or stylus). |
