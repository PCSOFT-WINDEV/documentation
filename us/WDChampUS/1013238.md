## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000130"></a>
WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile allow you to handle a Spin control through programming. To do so, use the variable of the Spin control in the code.

The variable of the Spin control:

- corresponds to the name of the Spin control.

- is initialized with the spin value.




<a name="NOTE2"></a>
<a name="NOTE2_1"></a>


## Retrieving the spin value
<a name="retrieving_the_spin_value_ELTTEXTE000154"></a>
To retrieve the spin value, use the following syntax:


```txt
<Position> = <Spin Name>
```


&lt;Position&gt; is an integer variable.

**Remark**: You can also use the [Value](../Proprietes/2510130.md) property.

<a name="NOTE3"></a>
<a name="NOTE3_1"></a>


## Modifying the spin value
<a name="modifying_the_spin_value_ELTTEXTE000178"></a>
To modify the spin value, use the following syntax:


```txt
<Spin Name> = <Value>
```


&lt;Value&gt; is a value found between the minimum and maximum value of the spin box control. These values have been defined in the control description window or in the code with the [MinValue](../Proprietes/2510008.md) and [MaxValue](../Proprietes/2510009.md) properties.

**Remark**: You can also use the [Value](../Proprietes/2510130.md) property.

<a name="NOTE4"></a>
<a name="NOTE4_1"></a>


## Properties specific to the management of a Spin control
<a name="properties_specific_the_management_spin_control_ELTTEXTE000202"></a>
The following properties are used to manage the characteristics of a spin by programming.


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [MaxValue](../Proprietes/2510009.md) | Used to find out and modify the upper bound of a spin. |
| [MinValue](../Proprietes/2510008.md) | Used to find out and modify the lower bound of a spin. |
| [ScrollValue](../Proprietes/2510011.md) | Used to find out and modify the increment step of a spin. |


For a complete list of WLanguage properties that can be used with a Spin control, see [Properties associated with Spin controls](../WDChamp/1013226.md).
