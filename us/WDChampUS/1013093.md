In a window with input fields, a "Cancel" Button control is required to cancel the current input without validating.

| Help | The Button control has the same action as the F1 key.. The "Click" event of the control is executed (as opposed to WINDEV 5.5).. This type of Button control opens the help window associated with the current control. A Help Button control loses focus. The focus is given back to the control used previously. Neither the "Leave" nor the "Enter" event of the control is executed when the Help Button control is clicked.<br><br>![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) This type of button is not available. |

According to the Windows standards, the tabulation key (Tab key) is used to move from a control to another one (in edit mode).

You also have the ability to move from a control (in edit) to another one with the Enter key: to do so, no active button found in the window must be a Validation button and no control must be associated with the Enter key.
