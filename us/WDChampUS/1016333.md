## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000128"></a>
The Upload control is used to upload one or more files. 

The Upload control can be handled through programming. To do so, use the name of the Upload control ("Send" or "Add" button).

The Uploadxxx functions of WLanguage can also be used to handle an Upload control. For more details, see the list of [functions for upload management](../WDLang2/1000018815.md).

## Managing Drag and Drop of files to an Upload control (HTML5)
<a name="managing_drag_and_drop_files_upload_control_html5_ELTTEXTE000152"></a>
The browsers that support HTML5 (like Firefox and Chrome) allow you to Drag and Drop the files to the Upload control. 

The "UI" tab in the Upload control description window ("Send" or "Add" button) is used to manage this feature.

For an Upload control used to upload several files proposed by default, the control on which Drag and Drop can be performed corresponds by default to the cell of Upload control.
