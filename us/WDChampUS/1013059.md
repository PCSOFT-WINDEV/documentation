**To create an "Item" control**:

1. On the "Creation" pane, in the "Usual controls" group, click "Item".

2. Click the position where the control will be created in the report.

### Special "Item" control: "Currency + Euro"
<a name="special_item_control_currency_euro_ELTPARAGRAPHE000060"></a>

For a "Currency + Euro" Item control, you have the ability to manage:

- the **stored currency**: currency of data found in the data source of report. If the control is handled by programming, the corresponding currency will be the stored currency.

- the **displayed currency**: currency used to display/print the value in the report. This currency can differ from the stored currency. The conversion is automatically performed.

- the **dual display**: two "Currency + Euro" controls can be bound. The value displayed in the base control is automatically converted in the tracker control.




This type of control can also be used in a window. For more details on this control, see [The "Euro + Currency" type](../WDLang1/3033007.md).
