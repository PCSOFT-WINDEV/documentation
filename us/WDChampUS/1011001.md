## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000139"></a>
<a name="Nested_Report"></a>
The **nested reports** are used to print several reports (secondary reports) in a single report (main report).

These reports can have a different orientation (portrait/landscape).

For example, the following main report contains:

- a report displaying the characteristics of a customer.

- a report displaying the summary of orders for this customer for the last months.

For more details on creating nested reports, see [Creating a nested report](../WDChamp/1011003.md).

**Remarks**: 

- The report editor also enables you to use secondary reports in a main report via the internal reports. The following paragraph explains the differences between these two print modes.  

- To print reports with different orientations (portrait/landscape), we recommend that you use the sequencing of reports. This method can be easily implemented. For more details, see [Sequencing reports](../WDChamp/9000128.md).

### Differences between nested reports and internal reports
<a name="differences_between_nested_reports_and_internal_reports_ELTPARAGRAPHE000050"></a>

The **[internal reports](../WDChamp/1013044.md)** can also be used to print several secondary reports in a main report.

- Position of the secondary reports:
	In **nested reports**, secondary reports are printed below one another. The reports can have different orientations. A report in portrait mode can be nested in a report in landscape mode.
	In the **[internal reports](../WDChamp/1013044.md)**, the secondary reports can be printed:

	- one below another.

	- side by side.




- Parameters of the secondary reports:
	In a **nested report**, the secondary reports accept parameters. The parameters are passed when printing the nested report ([iPrintReport](../WDLang5/3046032.md)). For more details, see  [Report with parameters](../WDChamp/1011008.md).
	In an **[internal report](../WDChamp/1013044.md)**, the secondary report cannot accept parameters.




**Remark**: To simplify the use of secondary reports, the report editor allows you to create:

- [internal reports](../WDChamp/1013044.md).

- [reports based on queries](../WDChamp/1011013.md).
