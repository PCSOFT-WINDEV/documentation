A Dockable Panel can be created through programming with [PanelCreate](../WDLang1/1000023989.md). This function expects as parameter the internal window that contains the controls displayed in the Dockable Panel control. 

By default, the size of the Dockable Panel control will correspond to the size of the internal window in edition mode.
