## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000104"></a>
WEBDEV enables you to create static sites and/or dynamic sites. The main difference between these two types of sites is: 
the dynamic sites manage the data in an interactive mode while the static sites manage fixed data only.

A dynamic site can also include a static section (the presentation of the company for instance).
