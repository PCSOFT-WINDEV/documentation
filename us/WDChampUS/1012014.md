![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png)![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) WEBDEV manages the following events by default (order of appearance in the code editor):

| Event | Runtime condition |
| --- | --- |
| Global declarations <br>(Server code) | Declaration of variables global to the page. This is the first code run when opening the page. |
| Initialization <br>(Server code) | Executed when the page is opened.<br>The events are run in the following order:<br><br>- Initializing the page controls.<br><br>- Initializing the page.<br><br><br> |
| Loading (onload) of the page <br>(Browser code) | Browser code run when the page is displayed in the browser (performed by [PageDisplay](../WDLang2/3058008.md) or [PageRefresh](../WDLang2/3058011.md) for example). |
| Unload (onunload) page <br>(Browser code) | Browser code run when a new page is displayed in the browser. |
| Refreshing the page data <br>(Server code) | Event available only if the automatic data refresh was defined for the page (see [Refreshing the page data](../Editeurs/2030067.md)). This event is run when the page is refreshed. It is used for example to refresh the desired controls: filling a list, ... This is an Ajax event.<br><br>If this event returns <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>, the "After refreshing the page data (Browser code)" event is not run. |
| Request for refreshing the display <br>(Server code) | Contains all the code for refreshing the page controls: content of controls, state (visible, grayed, etc.), caption to refresh, etc.<br><br>This event can receive parameters. Simply declare a procedure in the event. For example: <br><br><br><pre><code>// Request for refreshing the display <br>PROCEDURE AskForRefresh(RefreshType is Boolean)</code></pre><br><br><br><br><br>This event is started upon request by the following functions: <br><br>- [RequestRefreshUI](../WDLang1/1000023899.md) or [RequestRefreshUIParent](../WDLang1/1000023900.md): Executes the event at the end of the current event (asynchronous execution). <br><br>- [ExecuteRefreshUI](../WDLang1/1000023901.md) or [ExecuteRefreshUIParent](../WDLang1/1000023902.md): Executes the event immediately. <br><br><br>When these functions are called, you can specify the value of the parameters expected by the event. |
| After refreshing the page data <br>(Browser code) | Event available only if the automatic data refresh was defined for the page (see [Refreshing the page data](../Editeurs/2030067.md)). <br><br>This event is run after the "Refreshing the page data (server code)". It is used to perform an additional process on the browser. If the "Refreshing the page data (Server code)" returns <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>, the event "After refreshing the page data (Browser code)" event is not run. |
| Close the page <br>(Server code) | Run when the page is closed. |
| Synchronization of the page <br>(Server code) | Server code used to manage the page synchronization when clicking the browser "Back" button. For more details, see [Managing the browser "Back" button](../WDChamp/1012001.md). |


**Remark**: Only the browser codes are available in a static page.

## Optional events
<a name="optional_events_ELTTEXTE000370"></a>
Several optional events can be managed.

To add an optional event:

1. Select the desired control.

2. Display the code window of this control (F2 key).

3. Click the link "Add other events to xxx" at the bottom of the window code, after the last event.  ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Traitements_optionnels_WD_OK%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)


4. All the optional events available for the control are displayed. 

5. Check the optional event to add and validate. 
	Remark: You can select several optional events. 

6. The selected optional event is automatically added to the events managed by the control.




To disable an optional event, simply perform the same operations to display the list of optional events. Then simply uncheck the optional events to delete. 
Remark: If the disabled code contains WLanguage code, this code is automatically deleted.

You can manage, for example:

- left mouse button down, up, double click,

- right button down, up, with double click, ...




For more details, see the [Optional events](../WDChamp/1014004.md).

### Optional events for managing the off-line mode
<a name="optional_events_for_managing_the_offline_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000245"></a>

Several optional events can be used to optimize the management of offline sites: 

| Event | Runtime condition |
| --- | --- |
| Switch to off-line mode (Browser code) | Run when switching to off-line mode. |
| Switch to on-line mode (Browser code) | Run when switching to on-line mode. |
| Whenever the status of the HTML cache changes (Browser code) | This event is used to check what happens when the page is loaded. This event is called whenever the cache is checked. <br>The following command line is used to retrieve the actions performed by the browser:<br><br><br><pre><code>Trace(JSInfoEvent("type"))</code></pre><br>You have the ability to find out:<br><br>- whether the browser is currently updating the cache, <br><br>- whether an error occurs<br><br>- whether the update of the cache is completed<br><br>- whether no update must be performed, ....<br><br><br> |


<a name="NOTE2_3"></a>


### Optional event to manage the navigation history
<a name="optional_event_manage_the_navigation_history_ELTPARAGRAPHE000281"></a>

A specific optional event is available to optimize the management of Back/Next buttons: "Move into the navigation history (onpopstate)". 

This event expects the data to display, as parameter. This data was stored in the history by [BrowserHistoryAdd](../WDLang2/1000023458.md) and [BrowserHistoryModify](../WDLang2/1000023459.md). 

If the Web user goes back to an entry in the history, the stored data will be transmitted to the "Move in the navigation history" event (optional page event). This event must process the data in order to restore the page status. This process must be associated with a procedure that expects the transmitted data as parameter: 

```txt
// Event "Move in the navigation history (onpopstate)"
PROCEDURE <ProcedureName>(<Data>)
```


Example: This example adds the page into the history and stores the insertion time. Going back to the previous history page displays the time.

```wl
x is Variant
x.Time = TimeSys()
BrowserHistoryAdd(x, MyPage.Title, "#before") 

x.Time = TimeSys()
BrowserHistoryAdd(x, MyPage.Title, "#after")
```

```wl
// Event "Move in the navigation history (onpopstate)" 
PROCEDURE ProcessHistory(stStatus)
Info(stStatus.Time)
```


Remark: Depending on the browser, the event "Move in the navigation history (onpopstate)" is also run when loading the page and when going back to the initial page display. In this case, the &lt;Data&gt; parameter transmitted to the event corresponds to Null.
