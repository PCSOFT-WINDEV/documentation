## When are the calculations performed?
<a name="when_are_the_calculations_performed_ELTTEXTE000085"></a>
The calculations are performed:

- when initializing the Table control. 

- when a process performs an addition or modification in a Table control with calculations:

	- the totals are re-calculated at the end of process (or when using [Multitask](../WDLang1/3015004.md)).

	- if the value of a calculation is requested (see next paragraph), the calculation is instantly rerun.







[TotalsEnabled](../Proprietes/2510122.md) is used to forbid or force the calculations performed in a Table control. 

**Caution**: If the [DisplayEnabled](../Proprietes/2510015.md) property is used on the Table control and is set to <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>, the automatic calculations are not updated.

## Retrieving the calculation result
<a name="retrieving_the_calculation_result_ELTTEXTE000133"></a>
The result of calculations performed in a Table control can be handled through programming.

Several constants are used to identify the calculation row of a column:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *rowAverage* | Row containing the result of a mean. |
| *rowCount* | Row containing the result of the count. |
| *rowMaximum* | Row containing the maximum value of column cells. |
| *rowMinimum* | Row containing the minimum value of column cells. |
| *rowTotal* | Row containing the result of a total. |


**To retrieve the value of a calculation, use the following syntax**:


```txt
<Column name>[<Type of calculation>]
```

Example:


```wl
// Retrieve the result for the average calculated in the COL_GRADE column
Trace(COL_GRADE[RowAverage])
```


<a name="NOTE3"></a>
<a name="NOTE3_1"></a>


## Modifying the characteristics of calculations through programming
<a name="modifying_the_characteristics_calculations_through_programming_ELTTEXTE000196"></a>
WINDEV allows you to modify the characteristics (font, color, ...) of a column result through programming with several WLanguage properties. The WLanguage properties can be used to modify the color of result, its background color, its font, ... However, the content of result cell cannot be modified through programming.

**To use a WLanguage property on the result of a column**, the following syntax must be used:


```txt
<Column name>[<Type of calculation>].<Property>
```

Example:


```wl
// Color the mean result in red. The background is colored in blue
COL_GRADE[RowAverage].Color = LightRed
COL_GRADE[RowAverage].BackgroundColor = LightBlue
```

## Exporting the results of calculations

### Export via the AAF (Automatic Application Features) of Table control
<a name="export_via_the_aaf_automatic_application_features_table_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000361"></a>

The context menu of Table and TreeView Table controls contains several options to export the control content. 

During this export, the results of automatic calculations are exported. 

**Remarks**: 

- Only the value is exported, not the caption. 

- During the export in Excel, the cell corresponding to the calculation contains the corresponding Excel formula. 





### Export via the WLanguage functions
<a name="export_via_the_wlanguage_functions_ELTPARAGRAPHE000378"></a>

Several WLanguage functions can be used to export the content of a Table control in a specific format (Word, Excel, XML, ...). During this export, the rows corresponding to calculations are also exported by default.

To avoid exporting the calculation rows, all you have to do is specify the *taNoTotal* constant in the following functions:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [&lt;Table&gt;.ToClipboard](../WDLang1/1410088375.md) | Copies the content of a Table or TreeView Table control to the clipboard. |
| [&lt;Table&gt;.ToExcel](../WDLang1/1410088379.md) | Creates an Excel file with the data from a Table or TreeView Table control. |
| [&lt;Table&gt;.ToText](../WDLang1/1410088376.md) | Creates a character string from the data found in a Table or TreeView Table control. |
| [&lt;Table&gt;.ToWord](../WDLang1/1410088377.md) | Creates a Word file (.RTF) from the data found in a Table or TreeView Table control. |
| [&lt;Table&gt;.ToXML](../WDLang1/1410088378.md) | Creates an XML file from the data found in a Table or TreeView Table control. |
