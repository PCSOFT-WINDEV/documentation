## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000169"></a>
The report editor allows you to create "TreeView Table" reports. 
The report includes a table (like the Table reports). By default, the header is printed in the Page Header block, the data rows in the Body block and the total row in the End of Document block.

This table contains a treeview column: This column will display the report hierarchy.

**Sources of the TreeView Table report**
The sources of the TreeView Table report can be: 

- one or more data files, 

- a TreeView Table control, 

- none. In this case, the report is programmed with the WLanguage functions.

### Creation
<a name="creation_ELTPARAGRAPHE000040"></a>

To create a TreeView Table report from the report editor: 

1. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_nouveau.gif)
 in the quick access buttons. 

	- The creation window appears: click "Report" then "Report".

	- The report creation wizard starts.




2. Choose a "TreeView Table" report. The wizard proposes the available data sources: 

	- one or more data files 

	- a TreeView Table control. 

	- through programming. 

	- no data source. 




3. If you choose "From one or more data files", the wizard allows you to define: 

	- the files that will be used as report source: 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Etat_TabH_Assistant.gif&type=thumb)


	- the items to print, their captions and their blocks:

4. If you choose "From a TreeView Table control", the wizard asks for the following elements:  

	- the name of the TreeView Table control on which the report will be based. Only the TreeView Table controls in the windows or pages of the current project are proposed.

	- the lines to print: selected lines or all the control lines. 

	- the items (columns of the TreeView Table control) to print, their captions and their blocks. 

	- the calculations to perform (on the numeric items).




5. Specify the format of sheet on which the report will be printed. The report is printed in A4 format by default.

6. Select the skin template to use. 

7. Type the name and title of the report (name of ".WDE" file corresponding to the report). This name will be used to identify the report in your programs.
	![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) You also have the ability to specify whether the report can be modified by the end user in "Reports and Queries". 

8. Validate the report creation. 

9. If the generated table is too big, you have the ability to: 

	- Print the table on several pages (in width). For more details, see [Multi-page print](../WDChamp/1011065.md). 

	- Use the landscape mode,

	- Reduce the table size. 




10. The report currently created is displayed in the report editor. 




Remark: If the report is created through programming or without data source, a report containing a table with a treeview column is created.

### Remarks
<a name="remarks_ELTPARAGRAPHE000093"></a>

- The "Data" tab in the report description window is used to get and modify the data source. If the report is based on: 

	- data files, the different hierarchy levels are visible and modifiable. 

	- a TreeView Table control, you have the ability to define the print options of the hierarchy. 




- If the report is based on a TreeView Table control: 

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) The [SelectionOnly](../Proprietes/2511017.md) property is used to get and change the records that will be printed in the report: printing all records or the selected records only.

	- The [KeepVisibleHierarchy](../Proprietes/1000021055.md) property is used to get and modify the print mode of the hierarchy: printing the entire hierarchy or printing the hierarchy that is visible in the control.

	- The [HierarchicalDepth](../Proprietes/1000021027.md) property is used to get the depth of the control that defines the hierarchy. You can for example modify the characteristics of the elements found on a given level. 

	- The [ExpandedImage](../Proprietes/2513015.md) and [CollapsedImage](../Proprietes/2513016.md) properties are used to get and modify the expanded or collapsed image associated with the control that defines the hierarchy. No image is associated with the hierarchy by default. 




- The hierarchy of a control is defined in the "Binding" tab of the control description window.
