<a name="configuring_the_sidebar_control_tabs_ELTTEXTE000159"></a>
The "General" tab in the description window of the Sidebar control allows you to:

- add, delete, insert new tabs.

- configure (for the tab selected in the preview):

	- the initial state of the tab.

	- its caption.

	- the image associated with the text of the tab. 
			**Caution**: This image is not displayed in the background of the tab but to the left of the text.







**Remark**: There are no automatic scrollbars in the tabs of Sidebar controls. If some controls cannot be displayed, the controls are truncated.

## Managing tabs
<a name="managing_tabs_ELTTEXTE000183"></a>
The "UI" tab of the Sidebar control description window allows you to manage the display of tabs.

You can set:

- the animation used when changing tabs.

- the option to remember the active tab. If this option is selected, the state of the tab will be saved when the window is closed. This tab will be automatically selected the next time the window is opened.

## Managing the background image of tabs
<a name="managing_the_background_image_tabs_ELTTEXTE000207"></a>
The "Details" tab of the Sidebar control description window allows you to manage the background image of the tabs. This image is used by all the tabs. This image can contain the different states of the tab.

**Tip**: To get outstanding images, check the image catalog of WINDEV/WINDEV Mobile and select a button image with 5 states.

### States of tabs
<a name="states_tabs_ELTPARAGRAPHE000059"></a>

You can manage the different states of the tab via the associated image.

Each state corresponds to a specific drawing. All the drawings are saved in a single image. This image is associated with the tab: all you have to do is specify the number of states (or drawings) found in the image file.

### Special case: image of 3-image tabs
<a name="special_case_image_3image_tabs_ELTPARAGRAPHE000075"></a>

WINDEV will automatically split the tab image into three separate images.

The following criteria are used:

- the image is divided into three sections

- section 1 corresponds to the left area

- section 3 corresponds to the right area

- section 2 corresponds to the middle area. The size of this section is equal to 16 pixels. If the tab is proportional to the text, this part will be repeated as many times as necessary to fit the text.

**Remark**: If section 2 is smaller than 16 pixels, it is not recommended to use a tab proportional to the text. If necessary, integrate the additional images and the text into the image.
