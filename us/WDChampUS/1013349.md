## Overview

### Control of a WINDEV Mobile window
<a name="control_windev_mobile_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000010"></a>

The Camera control is used to: 

- view the video captured by the camera of an Android or iOS device. 

- read and decode the bar codes. For more details, see [Camera control: decoding bar codes](../WDChamp/1013304.md). 




You can save this video or save a video snapshot.

**Remark**: You can use the native camera of the device to record a video or take a photo ([CameraRunApp](../WDLang1/1000022470.md)).




### Creating a Camera control
<a name="creating_camera_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000054"></a>

To create a Camera control:

1. On the "Creation" tab, in the "Graphic controls" group, click "Camera".

2. Click at the desired location to create the control. The control appears in the editor.




To view the characteristics of the control, select "Description" in the context menu.

The Camera control can be handled programmatically using the [Camera functions](../WDLang1/1410086597.md). 
Remark: These functions are also available with a prefix syntax. For more details, see [Camera functions (Prefix syntax)](../WDLang1/1000022386.md).

**Remarks**: 

- A single Camera control can be used in a window.

- The Camera control exists in 2 versions: 

	- **Mode 27 or higher**: Camera control created in version 27. It allows using all the new functions and properties available from version 27 onwards (see below).  

	- **Version-26-compatible mode**: Camera control created before version 26. It uses features deprecated by Google. The "Version-26-compatible" mode, available in the control description window, is used to keep the same behavior as in previous versions. If this option is unchecked, the control will be set to mode 27 or higher.  








### Smart control
<a name="smart_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000096"></a>

WINDEV Mobile features a Smart control to use the camera of the device. All the main functionalities are integrated in this Smart control. It has a Button control (to be added in the window that will open the camera of the device) and a window (opened by the Button control). 

To add the Smart control in your window: 

1. In the editor, open the window in which the camera button will be integrated. 

2. On the "Creation" tab, in the "Graphic controls" group, expand "Camera".

3. Click the control that appears and then click in the window to set the position of the button. The button is created and the "WIN_Mobile_Camera_UI" window is added to the project. This window contains different planes that allow you to manage photo capture and video recording.

### Camera control in version 26 and earlier
<a name="camera_control_version_26_and_earlier_ELTPARAGRAPHE000174"></a>

If you used the Camera control in previous versions, the control is automatically set to "Version-26-compatible" mode when you upgrade the project to version 27. In this mode: 

- The new properties and functions in version 27 are not available and cause a fatal error.

- When taking a photo: 

	- the autofocus is taken into account if it is enabled. 

	- the orientation of the camera is taken into account for the final orientation of the photo.




- The click code on the Camera control allows you to trigger the photo capture or to start recording a clip (and to stop). 




Only the video being captured can be viewed in a Camera control.

To view:

- an image captured with [CameraCapture](../WDLang1/1000022450.md), use an [Image control](../WDChamp/1013218.md).

- a video captured with [CameraCapture](../WDLang1/1000022450.md), use a [Multimedia control](../WDChamp/9500200.md).
