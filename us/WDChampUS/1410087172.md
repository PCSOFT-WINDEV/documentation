## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000265"></a>
In WINDEV and WEBDEV, you can handle Diagram Editor controls programmatically. To do so, use the control variable in the code.

Diagram Editor controls can also be handled programmatically using [Diagram functions](../WDLang1/1410088562.md).  

This help page explains how to handle a Diagram Editor control programmatically. 





## Handling the Diagram Editor control programmatically
<a name="handling_the_diagram_editor_control_programmatically_ELTTEXTE000289"></a>


### Overview
<a name="overview_ELTPARAGRAPHE000022"></a>

Diagram Editor controls allow you to programmatically create and display diagrams. To do so, WLanguage provides you with: 

- [Diagram functions](../WDLang1/1410088562.md). 

- Different types of specific variables, allowing you to handle diagrams and shapes. For more details, see [Diagram management variables](../WDLang1/1410088562.md). 







### Export a diagram as an image
<a name="export_diagram_image_ELTPARAGRAPHE000036"></a>

To export a diagram as an image, you can use [DiagramToImage](../WDLang1/1410088144.md). This function exports the diagram as a variable of type [Image](../WDLang1/1000019650.md). Then, simply call one of the following functions to get the image of the diagram in the desired format: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [dSaveImageBMP](../WDLang1/3029026.md) | Saves an image:<br><br>- in a file in BMP format.<br><br>- in memory.<br><br><br> |
| [dSaveImageGIF](../WDLang1/3029040.md) | Saves an image:<br><br>- in a file in GIF format.<br><br>- in memory.<br><br><br> |
| [dSaveImageICO](../WDLang1/1000020798.md) | Saves an image in icon format either in a file, or in memory. |
| [dSaveImageJPEG](../WDLang1/3029038.md) | Saves an image:<br><br>- in a JPEG file.<br><br>- in memory.<br><br><br> |
| [dSaveImagePNG](../WDLang1/3029027.md) | Saves an image:<br><br>- in a PNG file.<br><br>- in memory.<br><br><br><br><br> |
| [dSaveImageTIFF](../WDLang1/1000020852.md) | Saves an image in TIFF format into a file or memory. |








### Managing shape libraries
<a name="managing_shape_libraries_ELTPARAGRAPHE000049"></a>

Multiple shape libraries are included with the Diagram Editor control. 

You can create your own shape library. A shape library is a diagram loaded as a library. This diagram can be created: 

- via the Diagram Editor control: 

	1. Create a diagram. 

	2. Import the images that correspond to the desired shapes. 

	3. Save the diagram as a ".wddiag" file. 




- programmatically:

	1. Create a variable of type [Diagram](../WDLang1/1410088055.md). This variable will hold the shape library. 

	2. Create the different custom shapes. 

	3. Add the shapes to the "Library" diagram. 

	4. Save the "Library" diagram as a ".wddiag" file. 







Once the "Library" diagram has been created:  

1. Load the diagram as a library ([DiagramLoadLibrary](../WDLang1/1410088356.md)). 

2. Add the library to the array of libraries of the final diagram. 




Example of a library created programmatically: 

```wl
sFile is string = fTempDir() + [ fSep ] + "custom_library.wddiag"

// Creates a library entirely through programming
TempLibrary is Diagram

D1 is diagOval
D1.Width = 50
D1.Height = 50
D1.Background.Color = DarkRed
Add(TempLibrary.Shape, D1)

D2 is diagOval
D2.Width = 50
D2.Height = 70
D2.Background.Color = DarkGreen
Add(TempLibrary.Shape, D2)

// Use the shapes of the temporary diagram to create the library
// Saves the diagram to the disk
DiagramSave(TempLibrary, sFile)

// Load the diagram as a library
MyLibrary is diagLibrary
DiagramLoadLibrary(MyLibrary, sFile)
MyLibrary.Name = "Custom"

// Adds the library to the Diagram Editor control
Add(DIAGEDT_Diagram.Library, MyLibrary)

ToastDisplay("The custom library has been added to the list.")
```


Remark: To use only your custom libraries, delete the default libraries. To do so, use [ArrayDeleteAll](../WDLang1/3075010.md) on the array of libraries of the diagram.

## Programming tips
<a name="programming_tips_ELTTEXTE000389"></a>


### Retrieving the characteristics of a selection in a Diagram Editor control
<a name="retrieving_the_characteristics_selection_diagram_editor_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000092"></a>

You can retrieve the characteristics of a selection in a Diagram Editor control using the [Selection](../Proprietes/1000023033.md) property. If the selection includes more than one shape, you can loop through the array of shapes. 

Example: 

```wl
// Retrieve the selected elements in a Diagram Editor control
MySelection is diagSelection <- DIAGEDT_MyDiagram.Selection
IF MySelection.Shape.Count > 0 THEN
	// Get the shapes
	FOR EACH stShape OF MySelection.Shape	
		STC_SELECTION_INFO = stShape.Name + "has been selected." + 
		" [ " + stShape.X + ", " + stShape.Y + " - " + stShape.Width + 
		"x" + stShape.Height + " ]"	
	END
ELSE
	STC_SELECTION_INFO = "Click a shape in the diagram to get the selection"
END
```



### Using the Note property of the different shapes
<a name="using_the_note_property_the_different_shapes_ELTPARAGRAPHE000103"></a>

[diagShape](../WDLang1/1410088082.md) variables ([diagOval](../WDLang1/1410088135.md), [diagRectangle](../WDLang1/1410088083.md), etc.) have a **Note** property. This property can be used to save additional information: shape number, type of shape, business logic information, etc, ... If the diagram is saved as a "wddiag" file, the information specified using the **Note** property is also saved. This information can then be read and processed when looping through the different shapes of a diagram.

To see an example of this solution, see [creating an interactive diagram](../WDChamp/1410087174.md). 




### Determining the type of a shape
<a name="determining_the_type_shape_ELTPARAGRAPHE000122"></a>

To determine the type of a shape, simply assign the shape to the different available variables.  

Example: 

```txt
FOR EACH shape OF DIAGEDT_MyDiagram.Shape
	ImageShape is diagImage <- shape
	IF ImageShape <> Null THEN
   		// The shape is an image
	END
END
```
