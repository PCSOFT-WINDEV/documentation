### Creating the control
<a name="creating_the_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000011"></a>

To create a Spreadsheet control: 

1. On the "Creation" tab, in the "Data" group, click "Spreadsheet". 

2. Click the position where the control will be created in the report.




To view the characteristics of the control, select "Description" in the context menu. 

**Remark**: The data displayed by a Spreadsheet control in a report can: 

- be determined through programming (for example, direct display of an xls or xlsx file). 

- correspond to a memo item of a data file or query, ... 

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) correspond to a Spreadsheet control in a window. 

	- correspond to an [xlsDocument](../WDLang5/1000017464.md) variable.

## Characteristics of Spreadsheet control in a report
<a name="characteristics_spreadsheet_control_report_ELTTEXTE000152"></a>
The main characteristics of a Spreadsheet control in a report are defined in the different tabs of the description window of the control: 

- "General" tab: The option **Scaling** corresponds to the property [AdjustmentMode](../Proprietes/1000021790.md). The available options are: 

	- No scaling: The worksheet is printed with its dimensions. The print can be performed on several pages in width and in height if necessary. 

	- Adjust the calculation sheet to the control dimensions: The worksheet will be reduced in order to be entirely displayed in the Spreadsheet control. 

	- Adjust all the columns to the control width: The columns found in the worksheet will be reduced or enlarged in order for all the columns to be displayed in the control width. 

	- Adjust all the rows to the control height: The rows found in the worksheet will be reduced or enlarged in order for all the rows to be displayed in the control height. 




- "Binding" tab: Allows you to define the binding of the Spreadsheet control. The control can be: 

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) bound to a control in an application window.

	- bound to a variable. 

	- programmed ("None" is selected). For more details, see [Handling a Spreadsheet control through programming (in a report)](../WDChamp/1000033010.md). 








### Handling a Spreadsheet control in a report through programming
<a name="handling_spreadsheet_control_report_through_programming_ELTPARAGRAPHE000077"></a>

You can associate the Spreadsheet of a report with: 

- a variable of type [xlsDocument](../WDLang5/1000017464.md). Simply use the code: 
	
	```txt
	<Spreadsheet control> = <xlsDocument variable>
	```


- an xls/xlsx file. Simply use the code: 
	
	```txt
	<Spreadsheet control> = <Path of xls/xlsx file>
	```





Caution: Spreadsheet control management functions cannot be used on the Spreadsheet control of a report.
