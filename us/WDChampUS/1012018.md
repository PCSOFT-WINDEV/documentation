## Overview of pages
<a name="overview_pages_ELTTEXTE000273"></a>
Pages are the main interface of a WEBDEV site. Pages allow Web users to view and handle information.

This information can be:

- Dynamic information coming from data files, queries, etc. This information changes according to the requests made by the Web users.

- Static. The information is fixed and it does not change.

### Files corresponding to the pages
<a name="files_corresponding_the_pages_ELTPARAGRAPHE000105"></a>

The pages correspond to WEBDEV ".WWH " files. By default, these files are created in the main directory of the project.

When generating the pages of the site, the ".WWH" files are automatically converted into ".HTM" files. These HTML files are created in different directories depending on the type of the page:

- ***Dynamic page***: subdirectories of the project languages (e.g. "US", "FR", etc.).

- ***Static page***: subdirectories of the languages found in the "&lt;ProjectName&gt;_WEB" directory of the project ("MySite_Web/US" for example).
