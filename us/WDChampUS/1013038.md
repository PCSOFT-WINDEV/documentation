## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000138"></a>
WINDEV and WEBDEV allow you to handle a TreeView control through programming. To do so, use the variable of the TreeView control in the code.

The variable of the TreeView control corresponds to the name of the TreeView control.

This help page explains how to handle a TreeView control through programming. 

Remarks:

- Several WLanguage functions are specific to the management of TreeView controls. For more details, see [the functions for managing TreeView controls](../WDLang1/3018025.md).

- You also have the ability to handle an element found in a TreeView control through programming. For more details, see [Handling an element of a TreeView control programmatically](../WDChamp/1013040.md).

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) A TreeView control can also be linked to a data file or variable.

## Initializing a TreeView control

### Populating a TreeView control
<a name="populating_treeview_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000042"></a>

To initialize a TreeView control, all you have to do is describe all the treeview elements with [TreeAdd](../WDLang1/3018012.md).

```wl
TreeAdd(TREE_TVRecipe, "Recipe" + TAB + "Dessert", "CAKE-.BMP", "CAKE-.BMP")
TreeAdd(TREE_TVRecipe ,"Recipe" + TAB + "Dessert" + TAB + "Ice cream")
TreeAdd(TREE_TVRecipe, "Recipe" + TAB + "Dessert" + TAB + "Ice cream" + TAB +  ...
		"Vanilla", "NEXT5-.BMP")
TreeAdd(TREE_TVRecipe, "Recipe" + TAB + "Dessert" + TAB + "Ice cream" + TAB +  ...
		"Strawberry", "NEXT5-.BMP")
TreeAdd(TREE_TVRecipe, "Recipe" + TAB + "Dessert" + TAB + "Ice cream" + TAB +  ...
		"Chocolate", "NEXT5-.BMP")
TreeAdd(TREE_TVRecipe, "Recipe" + TAB + "Dessert" + TAB + "Cup")
TreeAdd(TREE_TVRecipe, "Recipe" + TAB + "Dessert" + TAB + "Cup" + TAB + ...
		"Peach Melba", "NEXT5-.BMP")
TreeAdd(TREE_TVRecipe, "Recipe" + TAB + "Dessert" + TAB + "Cup" + TAB + ...
		"Cherry Garcia", ...
	"NEXT5-.BMP")
TreeAdd(TREE_TVRecipe, "Recipe" + TAB + "Dessert" + TAB + "Cup" + TAB + ...
		"Colonel", "NEXT5-.BMP")
TreeAdd(TREE_TVRecipe, "Recipe" + TAB + "Dessert" + TAB + "Apple pie")
TreeAdd(TREE_TVRecipe, "Recipe" + TAB + "Dessert" + TAB + "Apple pie" + TAB + ...
	"with whipped cream", "NEXT5-.BMP")
TreeAdd(TREE_TVRecipe, "Recipe" + TAB + "Dessert" + TAB + "Apple pie" + TAB + ...
	"with apple brandy", "NEXT5-.BMP")
TreeAdd(TREE_TVRecipe, "Recipe" + TAB + "Dessert" + TAB + "Crème brûlée", ...
	 "NEXT5-.BMP")
TreeAdd(TREE_TVRecipe, "Recipe" + TAB + "Dessert" + TAB + "Meringue with cream", ...
	"NEXT5-.BMP")
TreeExpand(TREE_TVRecipe, "Recipe")
```

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Remark: To properly fill a TreeView control, you can use the [AddChildDelayed](../Proprietes/1000020927.md) property on the rows of the TreeView control. This property is used to define the procedure that will be run to fill the level to expand. The search for children and the fill of children are performed only when the user wants to see them.

## WLanguage properties associated with the TreeView controls
<a name="wlanguage_properties_associated_with_the_treeview_controls_ELTTEXTE000186"></a>
Several WLanguage properties can be used on the TreeView control. For a complete list of WLanguage properties that can be used with a TreeView control, see [Properties associated with TreeView controls](../WDChamp/1013028.md).

Example: How to find out the number of elements in a TreeView control:

```wl
Trace(TREE_MyTreeView.Count)
```

Example: How to modify the size of the font for all the elements of a TreeView control:

```wl
TREE_MyTreeView.FontSize = 14
```
