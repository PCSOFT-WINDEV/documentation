To compare two controls found in different windows: 

1. Select the first control to compare. 

2. In the popup menu (right mouse click), select "Compare with". 

3. A comparison wizard starts, allowing you to select the window containing the control to compare. This window can be: 

	- In the current project. All you have to do is select the requested window from the list. 

	- In another project. All you have to do is select the physical file path of the window. 




4. The wizard proposes the list of controls found in the window. All you have to do is select the one that will be used for the comparison. 

5. Specify the comparison options: 

	- Ignore blank lines: If this option is checked, the differences of empty lines in the code will be ignored. 

	- Ignore the differences of comments: If this option is checked, the differences of comments in the code will be ignored.

	- Compare subelements: If this option is checked, the sub-elements are compared (for a Table control for example, the columns are compared).
