## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000144"></a>
All controls found in a window (in a page or in a report) have a different Z-order position. The z-order position of a control corresponds to the order of appearance of the control in relation to the plane of the window (or page or report).

For example:
![Window displayed in the editor](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Altitude.gif)
![Vertical section of the window](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Altitude2.gif)
The Z-order position is used to manage the overlay effects of several controls: if two controls are overlaid (two images for instance), the control displayed in the foreground will be the control with the highest z-order.

## Modifying the Z-order position of a control
<a name="modifying_the_zorder_position_control_ELTTEXTE000168"></a>
The Z-order position of a control can be modified:

- [on the window, page or report editor](#NOTE2_2).

- [programmatically](#NOTE2_4).

### Changing the Z-order of a control in the window, page or report editor
<a name="changing_the_zorder_control_the_window_page_report_editor_ELTPARAGRAPHE000037"></a>

To change the Z-order of a control in the window, page or report editor: 

1. Select the desired control.

2. On the "Modification" pane, in the "Depth and alignment" group, select an action:

	- to position a control on the highest Z-order position: expand "Bring forward" and select "Bring to front".

	- to position a control on the lowest Z-order position: expand "Send backward" and select "Send to back".

	- to increase the Z-order position of a control: expand "Bring forward" and select "Bring forward".

	- to reduce the Z-order position of a control: expand "Send backward" and select "Send backward".

### To modify the Z-order position of a control through programming
<a name="modify_the_zorder_position_control_through_programming_ELTPARAGRAPHE000060"></a>

Use [ZOrder](../Proprietes/2510002.md) on controls in a window or report.

### Single Z-order position
<a name="single_zorder_position_ELTPARAGRAPHE000075"></a>

All the controls belonging to the same window (or to the same report) have a different z-order position.

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) **Special cases**: 

- **Control within a Tab control, supercontrol or toolbar**
	If the window contains a Tab control:

	- A z-index is assigned to the Tab control. This Z-order is relative to the window

	- The Z-order of the controls within the Tab control is relative to the Tab control. All the controls associated with the Tab control have a different z-index


Supercontrols and toolbars work in the same way as Tab controls.

- ** Planes of a window**
	If the window uses multiple planes, the z-index of controls is global to all planes.
	For more details, see [The planes](../WDChamp/1013078.md).
