	From version <B>18</B>, the framesets are available for backward compatibility with the former sites. However, they are not supported in HTML 5 and they are not recommended for the referencing and/or for the navigation from mobile devices. <br>We advise you to replace the framesets by pages that share page templates and/or control templates.

## Creating, opening a frameset
<a name="creating_opening_frameset_ELTTEXTE000282"></a>


### Creating a frameset
<a name="creating_frameset_ELTPARAGRAPHE000048"></a>

WEBDEV proposes several methods for creating a frameset:

- Creating a blank frameset.

- Using a preset frameset.

- Building a site based on framesets from the analysis.




For more details, see [Creating a frameset](../WDChamp/1012002.md).
<a name="NOTE2_2"></a>


### Opening a frameset
<a name="opening_frameset_ELTPARAGRAPHE000064"></a>

To open a frameset: 

1. On the "Home" pane, in the "General" group, expand "Open" and select "Open" (Ctrl + O).

2. Select the frameset to open.




Other operations:

- Double-click the name of the frameset displayed in the "Project explorer" pane, "Pages" option.

- Double-click the representation of the frameset in the project graph, in the project editor.

## Associating a frame with a page, associating a frame with a frameset
<a name="associating_frame_with_page_associating_frame_with_frameset_ELTTEXTE000312"></a>


### Associate a frame with a page
<a name="associate_frame_with_page_ELTPARAGRAPHE000086"></a>

To associate a frame with a page: 

1. In the "Project Explorer" pane, select the page to associate.

2. Drag and Drop the page found in the "Project explorer" pane toward the frame where the page must be displayed.

3. Save the frameset: on the "Page" pane, in the "Edit" group, expand "Frame" and select "Save the frameset".




Remarks:

- To associate a frame with a page, you can also click inside a frame and open the page that must be associated with the current frame. The opened page appears in the current frame.

- When creating and saving the frameset, the initial status of the frameset is automatically defined. For more details, see [Define the initial status of a frameset](#NOTE6_1).

## Adding or deleting a frame into/from a frameset
<a name="adding_deleting_frame_intofrom_frameset_ELTTEXTE000336"></a>


### Add a frame into a frameset
<a name="add_frame_into_frameset_ELTPARAGRAPHE000117"></a>

To add a frame into a frameset: 

1. On the "Page" pane, in the "Edit" group, expand "Frame" and select: 

	- "Vertical" to perform a vertical split. 

	- "Horizontal" to perform an horizontal split.




2. Select the position of the new frame (to the left, to the right, to the top, to the bottom) in relation to the current frame.


The selected frame is divided. You have the ability to resize the two new frames. For more details, see [Modify the dimensions of a frame](#NOTE5_1).
<a name="NOTE4_2"></a>


### Delete a frame from a frameset
<a name="delete_frame_from_frameset_ELTPARAGRAPHE000145"></a>

To delete a frame from a frameset: 

1. Select the frame to delete. The outline of selected frame appears in red.

2. On the "Page" tab, in the "Edit" group, expand "Frame" and select "Delete the frame". The remaining frames are automatically resized to occupy the available space.

## Modify the dimensions of a frame
<a name="modify_the_dimensions_frame_ELTTEXTE000366"></a>
To modify the dimensions of a frame: 

1. Click inside the frame that must be modified. The outline of selected frame appears in red.

2. Hover the border to resize. When the mouse cursor turns into a double arrow, keep the left mouse button down while resizing the frame.

3. Release the left mouse button. The resizing is performed.


To avoid having too many scrollbars in your frames, the controls found in the pages associated with the frames must be visible in the frameset.

## Defining the initial pages of the frameset
<a name="defining_the_initial_pages_the_frameset_ELTTEXTE000390"></a>
The initial pages of a frameset must be defined: these pages will be opened by default when the frameset is opened in the browser of the Web user.

To define the initial pages of the frameset:

1. Associate the requested pages with the different frames.

2. On the "Page" pane, in the "Edit" group, expand "Frame" and select "Define the initial status".




**Reminder**: A frameset is used to display several pages in the same window of a browser. The HTML file corresponding to the frameset contains:

- The definition of the division of the different frames in the browser.

- The name of the pages opened when the frameset is displayed in the browser.



<a name="NOTE6_2"></a>


### Nesting the framesets
<a name="nesting_the_framesets_ELTPARAGRAPHE000205"></a>

By default, a frameset is used to display several pages in the same window of the browser. One of the pages displayed in the frameset can be a frameset itself: we talk of "Nested framesets". The nested framesets can be used to implement outstanding layout in your pages for example.
