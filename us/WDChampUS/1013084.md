### Events supported by WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile
<a name="events_supported_windev_and_windev_mobile_ELTPARAGRAPHE000013"></a>

WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile manage the following events by default (order of appearance in the code editor): 


| Event | Runtime condition |
| --- | --- |
| Initialization | Run when opening the window.\*<br><br>**Special case: Looper control populated automatically based on a data file**:<br>When this code is run, the Looper control is not filled yet. To force the Looper control to be filled in this code, use: <br><br><br>- the [LooperDisplay](../WDLang2/3083001.md) function<br><br>- the Table control based on a data file management properties: [BrowsedFile](../Proprietes/2510040.md), [BrowsedItem](../Proprietes/2510111.md) or [Filter](../Proprietes/2510042.md) properties.<br><br><br>You can also filter records with [HFilter](../WDLang4/3044100.md). |
| End of initialization | **Event only for Looper controls populated automatically based on a data file**:<br>Run once the Looper control has been filled. This code can be used to add or modify an element of the Looper control. |
| Entry in the Looper control | Run when one of the Looper controls gains focus. |
| Exit from the Looper control | Run when moving from one control to another (TAB key, selecting another control with the mouse, etc.). |
| Whenever a Looper control is modified | Run when the user modifies the content of the Looper control.<br><br>![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) This event is not run. |
| Entry in edit in a row of the Looper control | Run when the user selects a row to enter data.<br><br>![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) This event is not run. |
| Exit from a row of the Looper control | Run when moving from one row or control to another (TAB key, selecting another control with the mouse, etc.).<br><br>![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) This event is not run. |
| Displaying a row of the Looper control | Run when a new row must be displayed in the Looper control: redisplaying the Looper control, etc.<br><br>![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) This event is not run.<br><br> |
| Selecting a row of the Looper control | Run when the user selects a row (without input). |
|   | This event is automatically added when the "Pull to refresh" option is enabled ("Details" tab in the Looper control description window).<br>This event is run when a refresh gesture is detected on the Looper control. <br><br>Once this event has been run, the refresh bar will be automatically hidden except if [LooperRefreshVisible](../WDLang2/1000021195.md) is called.<br><br>For more details, see [Pull to Refresh on Table and Looper controls (Android/iOS)](../WDChamp/9000156.md). |
|   | **Event only available if an automatic deletion on row swipe has been defined** ("Details" tab of the control description)<br><br>Run before the automatic deletion of record displayed in the row. This event is used to run different tests for example. If this event returns <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> the deletion is not performed.<br><br>For more details, see [Moves and gestures in a Looper control](../WDChamp/1013295.md). |
|   | **Event only available if an automatic deletion on row swipe has been defined** ("Details" tab of the control description)<br><br>Run after the effective deletion of the record. This event is used, for example, to re-display the data.<br><br>For more details, see [Moves and gestures in a Looper control](../WDChamp/1013295.md). |
|   | **Event only available if an action on row swipe has been defined** ("Details" tab of the control description)<br><br>- Case of automatic deletion: This event is executed BEFORE the event "Before deleting a row". If this event returns <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>, the event "Before automatically deleting a row" is not run and the record is not deleted.<br><br>- Case of action through programming: This event is run when the user swipes the row. This event allows you to program the desired action.<br><br><br><br><br>For more details, see [Moves and gestures in a Looper control](../WDChamp/1013295.md). |
|   | Run at the beginning of Drag/Drop for the element. This event is used to run different tests for example. If this event returns <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> the movement is not performed. |
|   | Run when the user finishes the element Drag/Drop. If this event returns <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> the movement is not performed. |
| Recording filtering | **Optional code for Looper controls populated automatically based on a data file**:<br>Run just before displaying a row. This event filters the records displayed in the Looper control. This event is detailed at the end of this page.<br><br> |
| Scrolling events (optional events) | These events make it easy to manage the vertical scrollbar in the control. The available events are:<br><br>- Start scrolling: Executed when the vertical scrollbar of the control starts moving. <br><br>- While scrolling: Executed while the vertical scrollbar of the control moves.  <br><br>- Stop scrolling: Executed when the vertical scrollbar of the control stops moving. <br><br><br><br><br>Remark: [ScrollbarPosition](../WDLang1/1000021057.md) gets the position of the scrollbar. |


(\*) By default, the "Initializing" event of each control is executed according to the order in which the controls were created in the window. To modify this order of execution: 

1. On the "Window" tab, in the "Order" group, click "Initialization". 

2. In the window that appears, use the arrows on the right to change the order in which the controls are initialized.

## Filter records (Looper based on a data file only)
<a name="filter_records_looper_based_data_file_only_ELTTEXTE000454"></a>
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) The event "Filtering the records" is run right after a row of the Looper control is displayed. Therefore, it is run:

- when initializing the Looper control.

- whenever a row is displayed in the Looper control.




This event filters the records displayed in the Looper control. 

To implement a filter, the "Filter records" event must return a value:

- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> to specify that the record matches to the filter and that it must be displayed.

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> to specify that the record does not match the filter and that it must not be displayed.

- <u><u><u><u>Cancel</u></u></u></u> to stop reading the data source of the Looper control (very rare case).




Example:

```wl
// -- Filtrage des enregistrements --
// Affiche uniquement les clients dont commandes sont supérieures à 3000 euros
SI Commande.TotalTTC >= 3000 ALORS 
	RENVOYER Vrai
SINON
	RENVOYER Faux
FIN
```
In this code, the data handled affects the record currently read by the Looper control. This data comes from the data file or query linked to the Looper control.

Remark: In WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile, the event "Recording the records" is an optional event. In WEBDEV, this event is proposed by default.

<a name="BrwClick"></a>


## Click on a Looper control (browser code only)
<a name="click_looper_control_browser_code_only_ELTTEXTE000478"></a>
The event "Click on the Looper control" is run when the user clicks on a row of the Looper control. 
This process is used to select the row. This event returns the values of the attributes corresponding to the row. For example, the following click code is used to find out the value of the ATT_Title attribute for the row that was clicked: 


```wl
Trace(ATT_Titre)
```


<a name="NOTE2"></a>
<a name="NOTE2_1"></a>


## Optional events
<a name="optional_events_ELTTEXTE000502"></a>
Several optional events are supported.
To add an optional event:

1. Select the desired control.

2. Display the code window of this control (F2 key).

3. Click the link "Add other events to xxx" at the bottom of the window code, after the last event.  ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Traitements_optionnels_WD_OK%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)


4. All the optional events available for the control are displayed. 

5. Check the optional event to add and validate. 
	Remark: You can select several optional events. 

6. The selected optional event is automatically added to the events managed by the control.




To disable an optional event, simply perform the same operations to display the list of optional events. Then simply uncheck the optional events to delete. 
Remark: If the disabled code contains WLanguage code, this code is automatically deleted.You can manage, for example:

- left mouse button down, up, double click,

- right button down, up, etc.
