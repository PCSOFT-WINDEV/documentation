### Page control
<a name="page_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000011"></a>

The Rich Text Area control (also called RTA) is a Static control offering several layout possibilities: 

- Text formatting,

- Insertion of images or links,

- Insertion of icons coming from the font,

- ...




The Rich Text Area control can be used to format a text section in a site. 

In edit, the HTML Rich Text Area control allows the developer to type the text to display (with all the formatting options). 

At runtime, the HTML Rich Text Area control allows the user to see a text with formatting, images and links.

3. In edit mode: 

	- you have the ability to type your text directly. You can for example paste a text coming from a software like Word: the formatting will be kept. 

	- the editor ribbon is adapted to the input in the control: all the available edit options are displayed: ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ZTR_Edition_ruban.gif)
These edit options are grouped into 4 categories: 

		- Font: used to specify the font attributes for the selected text. 

		- Paragraph: used to specify the attributes of paragraphs (indents, bullets, lists, centering and justification)

		- CSS style - Semantics: used to associate a CSS style and semantics to the selected text. 

		- Controls: used to add controls into the Rich Text Area control: 

			- an Image control, 

			- a Link control,

			- an icon coming from the font,

			- another control: all controls found in the "Creation" pane are available.

## Characteristics of Rich Text Area control
<a name="characteristics_rich_text_area_control_ELTTEXTE000296"></a>
The main characteristics of the Rich Text Area control can be accessed via the control description window. The description window of the Rich Text Area control is used to: 

- edit the HTML source code of the control ("General" tab). This code can be modified in the editor directly. You can: 

	- Add HTML code. If possible, the result of the added HTML code will be viewed in the editor (only the animations are not supported). These additions are stored in the control. 

	- Delete a section of HTML code. You have the ability to delete the HTML code corresponding to a link for example. 

	- Fill the generated HTML code. You can for example add specific tags for displaying a help tooltip. 




- see the list of controls found in the area ("General" tab). 

- display the description window of the controls found in the area ("Edit" button in the "General" tab). 

- define the interface options ("UI" tab). You can define: 

	- whether the Rich Text Area control can be stacked.

	- the semantics associated with the Rich Text Area control. 







Remarks: 

- The description window of the controls found in the Rich Text Area control differs from the one of the control outside the rich text area. Indeed, some information (especially the position and the style) is defined in relation to the Rich Text Area control (and not in relation to the Link or Image control).

- On a Static control found in a Rich Text Area control, you can define an anchor via the Static control description window ("General" tab, "Define as anchor").
