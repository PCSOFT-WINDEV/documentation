## Overview of the Popup control
<a name="overview_the_popup_control_ELTTEXTE000244"></a>
The Popup control is used to associate a popup with a page. This popup will be displayed from the page into which it is inserted. This popup is used to easily establish a dialog with the user. 

Until version 17, this type of dialog was establish via a [Cell control](../WDChamp/1013096.md). 

Using a Popup control allows you to handle the dialog window in the editor like a different element of the page, while being included in the page. Unlike the use of cells, using popups does not affect the page layout in the editor.
