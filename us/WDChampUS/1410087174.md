## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000268"></a>
The Diagram Editor control allows end users to create and edit diagrams.
For example, you can use a seating chart (stadium, venue, offices, etc.) to allow users to book seats. In this case, end users should be able to click the plan directly to select their seats.

Remark: In this example, end users will be able to book seats, but the same principle can be used in many other types of applications.

## Principle
<a name="principle_ELTTEXTE000292"></a>
Users will handle the plan via the Diagram Editor control. This plan is read-only. The user should not edit the diagram, but interact with its elements. In this case, the user must be able to select seats, without modifying the plan.

The Diagram Editor control has different events to support interactions:

- double click on a shape, 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) mouse hover,

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) left button up, 

- select a shape, 

- ...




This means that: 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) hovering over an element opens a tooltip.

- users can click or double-click a shape to select it (select and book seats in this case). The color or image of the seat can change depending on whether it is available or reserved.

## How to?
<a name="how_ELTTEXTE000316"></a>
These are the steps to create an interactive diagram: 

1. [Creating the plan](#NOTE3_2). 

2. [Configuring seats](#NOTE3_3).

3. Creating the user interface: 

	- [Creating the control](#NOTE3_4),

	- [Initializing the control](#NOTE3_5).

	- [Managing events of the control](#NOTE3_6).

### Creating the plan
<a name="creating_the_plan_ELTPARAGRAPHE000069"></a>

The seating plan is a diagram created with the Diagram Editor control. This plan contains different shapes that represent available seats. 

This plan is saved as a ".wddiag" file. Users will then be able to select seats in the plan using a Diagram Editor control.
<a name="NOTE3_3"></a>


### Configuring seats
<a name="configuring_seats_ELTPARAGRAPHE000078"></a>

Once the plan is created, each element must be "configured".

In the case of a concert hall for example, each seat has a name and a status. The status can be easily saved in the **Note** property of the [diagShape](../WDLang1/1410088082.md) variable.

This information must be configured in the diagram (in the ".wddiag" file corresponding to the plan).

Tips: 

- This can be done using a specific window. This window will allow the author of the plan to name each seat and associate a comment if necessary.

- Booked / available seats can be stored in an array, file, etc. to easily check for available seats.   



<a name="NOTE3_4"></a>


### User interface: creating the control
<a name="user_interface_creating_the_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000097"></a>

To successfully book seats, the user should not be able to edit the diagram in the Diagram Editor control. 

To create the Diagram Editor control: 

- In WINDEV: on the "Creation" tab, in the "Graphic controls" group, expand "Office" and select "Diagram Editor". 

- In WEBDEV: on the "Creation" tab, in the "Graphic controls" group, click "Diagrams". 




To make the Editor Diagram control read-only: 

1. Open the control description window. 

2. To hide the toolbars and panels: In the "General" tab, disable toolbars and panels. 

3. To make the control "read-only", use one of the following methods: 

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Method 1: In the "UI" tab of the control description window, select "Read-only".

	- Method 2: in the code, use the [State](../Proprietes/2510039.md) property to make the control unresponsive.

### User interface: initializing the diagram
<a name="user_interface_initializing_the_diagram_ELTPARAGRAPHE000147"></a>

The initialization of the diagram consists of: 

1. Loading the "blank" plan in the interface ([DiagramLoad](../WDLang1/1410088123.md)): the "blank" plan corresponds to the ".wddiag" file created previously.
	Example: 
	
	```wl
	diagControl is Diagram
	diagControl <- DIAGEDT_Plan
	diagControl.Load("seating_plan.wddiag")
	// Make the diagram unresponsive if necessary
	DIAGEDT_Plan.State = Inactive
	```


2. Initializing the plan to view the seats that are already booked, for example. To do so, simply handle the shape corresponding to the seat using a variable of type [diagShape](../WDLang1/1410088082.md). You can associate a note, change the border, background color, etc, ...
	Example: 
	
	```wl
	ShapeInDiagram is diagShape
	FOR EACH ShapeInDiagram OF diagControl.Shape
		sShapeName = ShapeInDiagram.Name // Gets the name of the shape
		// Compare shape name to the list of reserved seats
		// => Specific process for reserved seats: 
		// 	applies a red color to the seat and associates "Reserved" to the note
		// => Standard process for available seats
	END
	```



Remark: the list of reserved seats can be stored in an array, a file, etc.

### User interface: click
<a name="user_interface_click_ELTPARAGRAPHE000173"></a>

In this example, the Diagram Editor control is read-only: the selected shape cannot be directly handled using the [Selection](../Proprietes/1000023033.md) property. To identify the seat that was clicked, the [DiagramInfoXY](../WDLang1/1410088464.md) function should be used.

**In WINDEV**, when the end user clicks an available seat in the plan, this seat must be selected. Simply use the "Left button up" event in the Diagram Editor control. [DiagramInfoXY](../WDLang1/1410088464.md) allows you to identify the shape that was clicked.


```wl
diagControl is Diagram
...
// Gets the index of the shape under the cursor
nIndex is int
nIndex = DiagramInfoXY(DIAGEDT_Plan, MouseXPos(mpControl), MouseYPos(mpControl))
// The selected shape corresponds to diagControl.Shape[nIndex]
```
All the characteristics of the selected shape will be available. 

This works slightly differently **in WEBDEV**. In browser code, only the "Double click on a shape" event is available. Moreover, [diagShape](../WDLang1/1410088082.md) variables are not accessible in browser code. To manage double-clicks, you should create a Button control. This Button control contains server and browser code that allows retrieving the mouse position and selecting seats: 

- Browser code: 

	- Button control initialization (server code):  
			
		```wl
		GLOBAL
			XPos, YPos are int <browser synchronized>
		```


	- Click on the Button control - Browser side: Retrieve the position: 
			
		```wl
		(XPos, YPos) = (MouseXPos(mpControl), MouseYPos(mpControl))
		```


	- Click on the Button control - Server side (AJAX enabled): Get the shape under the cursor: 
			
		```wl
		diagControl is Diagram
		...
		// Gets the index of the shape under the cursor
		nIndex is int
		nIndex = DiagramInfoXY(DIAGEDT_Plan, XPos, YPos)
		// The selected shape corresponds to diagControl.Shape[nIndex]
		```






All the characteristics of the selected shape will be available.

### User interface: hover (WINDEV only)
<a name="user_interface_hover_windev_only_ELTPARAGRAPHE000213"></a>

You can make a tooltip appear when the user hovers over a seat, using the "Mouse hover" event of the Diagram Editor control. As with clicks, you can use [DiagramInfoXY](../WDLang1/1410088464.md) to determine which seat is being hovered. Simply use the [ToolTip](../Proprietes/2510005.md) property of the Diagram Editor control to display the desired information.
