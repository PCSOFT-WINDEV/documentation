## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000134"></a>
WINDEV, WINDEV Mobile and WEBDEV allow you to handle a Chart control through programming. To do so, use the variable of the Chart control in the code.

The variable of the Chart control corresponds to the name of the Chart control. This variable is an integer.

Several WLanguage functions can be used to handle a Chart control. For more details, see the [functions for chart management](../WDLang3/3042003.md).

## Handling the series of a Chart control
<a name="handling_the_series_chart_control_ELTTEXTE000158"></a>
To handle the series of a Chart control, use the following syntax:


```txt
<Chart name>[Series index].<Property name>
```


<a name="NOTE3"></a>
<a name="NOTE3_1"></a>


## Properties specific to the charts
<a name="properties_specific_the_charts_ELTTEXTE000182"></a>
The following properties are used to manage Chart controls through programming.


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [AnimationDuration](../Proprietes/1000021069.md) | Allows you to find out and modify the duration of animation for a Chart control. This property can also be used to delete the animation for a Chart control. |
| [Count](../WDLang1/3025009.md) | Allows you to find out the number of series found in a chart. |
| [Value](../Proprietes/2510130.md) | Allows you to find out the name of a Chart control. |
| [Empty](../Proprietes/2510126.md) | Allows you to find out whether a Chart control contains no series. |

## Remarks
<a name="remarks_ELTTEXTE000206"></a>
A Chart control can be handled in a single thread. A Chart control can only be handled in the thread that created it, which means in the main thread of the window. 

The Chart control can only be handled in the code that is directly or indirectly run from the processes of the window and window controls.

**Consequences**: Two threads cannot handle the same Chart control.
