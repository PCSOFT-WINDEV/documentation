## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000090"></a>
Refreshing a page consists in re-displaying a page that is already open in the browser. This action is the same as the "Refresh" button in the browser.

When a page is refreshed, the dynamic data in the page is updated according to the page context on the server. Only the modified data is re-displayed.

For example, when entering an order in a sales application, the page that displays the summary of the order (the cart) is refreshed each time a new item is ordered.

### Operations performed
<a name="operations_performed_ELTPARAGRAPHE000033"></a>

The following operations are automatically performed when a page is refreshed:

1. The existence of the page context on the server is checked.

2. The page is displayed again according to its context on the server.




Using [PageDisplay](../WDLang2/3058008.md) to refresh a page is not recommended because it takes longer to load the page.
