## Principle
<a name="principle_ELTTEXTE000149"></a>
Two methods can be used to animate a Static control:

- scrolling caption: the caption scrolls from one side of the control to the other one. For example: ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=LibelleScrollant.gif)


- blinking caption: the caption is displayed alternatively in two different colors.

### How to?
<a name="how_ELTPARAGRAPHE000022"></a>

To animate a Static control: 

1. Display the description window of the static control ("Description" from the popup menu of the static control).

2. In the "Details" tab, configure the animation options. Choose the type of animation and configure the associated options. The options depend on the selected animation mode.




For example, **if the scrolling animation is selected**, you have the ability to specify:

- The rate of refresh between each move.

- The number of pixels corresponding to a move.

- The scroll direction.




For example, **if the blinking animation is selected**, you have the ability to specify:

- The rate of refresh between each blink.

- The blinking color of the caption. Two colors are required to make a caption blink:

	- the standard color of the caption.

	- the blinking color of the caption. If this color is transparent, the caption will be displayed every other time.

### Remarks
<a name="remarks_ELTPARAGRAPHE000046"></a>

- RTF and text with a "Blurred shadow" cannot be animated.

- The animation of a Static control is only visible at runtime.

- Animated text is limited to 1024 bytes.

- The animation does not operate anymore if functions for text formatting are used ([gFontBold](../WDLang1/3029061.md), [gFontSize](../WDLang1/3029064.md), [gFontItalic](../WDLang1/3029062.md), [gFontUnderlined](../WDLang1/3029063.md)).

## Programming
<a name="programming_ELTTEXTE000203"></a>
Several WLanguage functions are used to manage the animated static controls. These functions are as follows:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [AnimationGetParameter](../WDLang1/3017003.md) | Reads the value of an animation parameter defined for an image in a Static control. |
| [AnimationSetMode](../WDLang1/3017001.md) | Changes the type of animation used in a Static control. |
| [AnimationSetParameter](../WDLang1/3017002.md) | Changes one of the animation parameters defined for a text in a Static control. |

Several WLanguage properties are used to manage the animated static controls. These properties are as follows:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [Animation](../Proprietes/2510006.md) | Used to find out the current status of the animation in a Static control and to start/stop an animation in an animated Static control. |
| [InitialAnimation](../Proprietes/2510012.md) | Used to find out the initial status of the animation in a Static control. |
