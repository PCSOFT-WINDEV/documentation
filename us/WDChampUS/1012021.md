## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000138"></a>
When creating a page, a validity period can be defined for this page.

For example, if a page is related to a specific event (a tradeshow, a promotion), this page must not be displayed anymore from a given date.

To prevent from forgetting it:

- WEBDEV will inform the developer when opening the project according to a configurable frequency. A UI error will be automatically displayed.

- The application server will send an email to a given address with a specific message.




The risks to forget are minimized.

	- Specify the validity period of the page.

	- Click the "Configure the reminders" button. In the window that is opened, specify:

		- the email address of the recipient of the reminder. If the WEBDEV application server is configured to find the expired pages, a reminder message will be automatically sent to this address.

		- the text added to the reminder message.

		- the date for sending the reminder (one week and one day before by default). This date will also be used to display a compilation error of UI. This compilation error will indicate whether the validity period of the page was reached.
