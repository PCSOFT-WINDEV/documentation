| Whenever modifying | Executed when the user confirms the changes made to the image in the Mobile Image Editor control. |

1. On the "Window" tab, in the "Order" group, click "Initialization". 

2. In the window that appears, use the arrows on the right to change the order in which the controls are initialized.
