## Overview

You can associate an action with the link regardless of the type of link. WEBDEV offers the most common actions in the general tab of the control description window.

For more specific actions, click "More options".

In any case, you will have to define the destination of this action.

## The available actions

### Preset actions
<a name="preset_actions_ELTPARAGRAPHE000024"></a>

Several preset actions are proposed by default in a drop-down list box. These preset actions depend on the elements in the page or project.

For example, you can choose to:

- execute the click code of a Link control (browser code or server and browser code),

- display a page of the site,

- display a page from another site, 

- perform a custom action (send an email, call a phone number, connect to an FTP server, download a file, etc.). In this case, different parameters can be specified. 




**Caution**: The actions are performed after the link click code (browser and server code)

### Specific actions
<a name="specific_actions_ELTPARAGRAPHE000040"></a>

The "More options" link shows more options. You can for example:

- do an action on another control, 

- set the position on one of the page anchors, 

- share a social network,

- change current language

- send the value of the page controls to ... a page or a script. For example, this option can be used to process the content of a form in a static site.




**Remark**: All these operations can also be performed in the code.

### Special case: social network share
<a name="special_case_social_network_share_ELTPARAGRAPHE000057"></a>

The "Share on a social network" action is used to create a link allowing you to share the current page, the current domain or a specific URL on a social network. This action can also be performed via the [Social Network](../WDChamp/1000028001.md) control. 

Remark: Using a button, a link or a clickable image allows you to entirely configure the style used (however, we advise you to comply with the license agreements of the different social networks). The [Social Network](../WDChamp/1000028001.md) control has advanced settings (e.g., display the number of shares, etc.). 

The table below presents the information used for each social network:
