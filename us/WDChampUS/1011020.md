## Overview of the Body block
<a name="overview_the_body_block_ELTTEXTE000080"></a>
The **Body** block corresponds to the main block of the report. This block is necessarily found in each report. This block is printed as many times as the number of records to print.

For the free reports, the **Body** block can be repeated as many times as necessary to fill the page ("Repeated until the end of the page" checked in the "UI" tab of the block characteristics).

**Remark**: The **Body** block cannot be deleted. However, this block can be made invisible (in the description window of the block or via the [Visible](../Proprietes/2510138.md) property).

For more details on the different options available on this type of block, see [Describing the report blocks](../WDChamp/1011049.md).
