## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000151"></a>
WINDEV allows you to handle a status bar and a cell found in a status bar through programming. To do so, use the variable of the status bar or the variable of the cell in the code.

The variable of a status bar corresponds to the name of the status bar. The variable of a cell found in a status bar corresponds to the name of the cell.

## Inserting a cell into the status bar of the current window

### How to?
<a name="how_ELTPARAGRAPHE000020"></a>

To insert a cell programmatically in a status bar, use [StatusBarAddCell](../WDLang1/3021001.md).

Then, this cell can be handled by several properties.
 
**Caution**: The name of a cell created by [StatusBarAddCell](../WDLang1/3021001.md) must be enclosed between indirection operators ({ }) in order to be handled by the WLanguage properties.

### Example
<a name="example_ELTPARAGRAPHE000037"></a>

The following example adds a cell in the status bar of the current window.

This cell displays the coordinates of the mouse cursor. The background of this cell is red. The font used in this cell is bold.


```wl
// -- Initialization code of window
// Adds "MyCell" to the status bar of the current window
StatusBarAddCell("MyCell", 100, LightRed) 
// Modifies the weight of the information displayed in "MyCell"
// The indirection operators are required for a cell created 
// by MessageAddCell
{"MyCell"}..FontBold = True
```



```wl
// -- Optional code for mouse rollover
// Displays the coordinates of the mouse cursor in "MyCell"
Message("MyCell", MouseXPos() + " , " + MouseYPos())
```

| [StatusBarAddCell](../WDLang1/3021001.md) | Adds a cell into the status bar of the current window. |
| [StatusBarDeleteCell](../WDLang1/3021002.md) | Deletes a cell from the status bar of the current window. |


**Remark**: The name of a cell created by [StatusBarAddCell](../WDLang1/3021001.md) must be enclosed between indirection operators to be handled by the WLanguage properties.
