A Combo Box control can be bound to an item in a data file, query, etc.

The following types of items can be bound to a Check Box control:

- Numeric, 

- Boolean, 

- Check Box.




**If the check box contains a single option**, the item will take for value:

- 1 if the box is checked

- 0 if the box is not checked.




**If the check box contains several options**, an array item is required. Each element of the array item will correspond to a check box option, and will take the following value:

- 1 if the box is checked

- 0 if the box is not checked.

## Updating an item with the data from the Check Box control
<a name="updating_item_with_the_data_from_the_check_box_control_ELTTEXTE000121"></a>
**1st case: the controls in the window, page or report are bound to items in a data file**
All the items in the data file (or a related file) that are bound to a control in the window, page or report will be updated by [ScreenToFile](../WDLang4/3044146.md).

**2nd case: the controls in the window, page or report are not bound to items in a data file**
The value of each control must be assigned to each item.

1. If the Check Box control has a single option: use the following syntax to update the item: 
	
	```txt
	<Data file>.<Item> = <Check Box control>
	```


2. If the Check Box control has multiple options and is bound to an array item: use the following syntax to update the item:
	
	```txt
	<Data file>.<Item>[Option index] = <Check Box control>[Option index]
	```
