## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000282"></a>
WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile allow you to handle a Calendar control through programming. To do so, use the variable of Calendar control in the code.

The variable of the Calendar control corresponds to the selected date (if the control is multi-selection or with period selection, the variable corresponds to the first selected date). This date uses the format specified in the "Stored format: " control found in the "General" tab of the control description. This variable is a string.

The Calendar control can be handled through programming: 

- via the WLanguage functions ([Calendar functions](../WDLang1/1000015008.md) and [functions for managing bank holidays](../WDLang1/3027029.md)).

- via the WLanguage properties. 


The Calendar control is associated with [several WLanguage processes](../WDChamp/1016303.md).

**Remarks**:

- You can also handle a day of a Calendar control through programming. For more details, see [Managing the calendar days](../WDChamp/1016304.md).

- WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile automatically manage the change of month or the change of year performed by the user.

## Managing public holidays
<a name="managing_public_holidays_ELTTEXTE000306"></a>
Public holidays can be set programmatically. Several WLanguage functions (starting with BankHolidayXXX) are available.

[BankHolidayAdd](../WDLang1/1000017304.md) is used to define the bank holidays displayed in a Calendar control. This function allows you to define the list of bank holidays that will be used. This function allows you to customize the public holidays according to the country and local regulations. This function must be used at the beginning of the application because it has a global effect on the application.

Example:

```wl
// Delete all public holidays
BankHolidayDeleteAll()
// Initialize the 11 public holidays common to the French regions and territories
BankHolidayAdd("0101")		// 1st of January
BankHolidayAdd(bhEasterMonday)	// Easter Monday
BankHolidayAdd("0501")		// 1st of May
BankHolidayAdd("0508")		// 8th of May
BankHolidayAdd(bhAscensionDay)	// Ascension day
BankHolidayAdd(bhWhitMonday)	// Whit Monday
BankHolidayAdd("0714")		// 14th of July
BankHolidayAdd("0815")		// 15th of August (Assumption)
BankHolidayAdd("1101")		// All Saints' Day
BankHolidayAdd("1111")		// 11th of November
BankHolidayAdd("1225")		// Christmas

// Add 2 additional public holidays for the regions of Moselle and Alsace
BankHolidayAdd("1226" + CR + bhGoodFriday)
```

## Managing multi-selection

### Retrieve the multi-selection
<a name="retrieve_the_multiselection_ELTPARAGRAPHE000100"></a>

A Calendar control can allow for multiple selection: the Calendar control will allow you to select several dates. To do so, simply check "       Multi-selection" in the "Details" tab of the control description. You can also use the [Multi-selection](../Proprietes/1000017054.md) property.

To retrieve the selected dates, all you have to do is use the [CalendarXXX functions](../WDLang1/1000015008.md) of WLanguage.

Example:

```wl
// Browse the dates selected in the Calendar control
FOR I = 1 _TO_ CalendarSelectOccurrence(CAL_Calendar1)
	Trace(CalendarSelect(CAL_Calendar1, I))
END
```

### Managing the selection of a time period
<a name="managing_the_selection_time_period_ELTPARAGRAPHE000131"></a>

A Calendar control allows you to select time periods: the Calendar control then allows you to select the start and end date of the time period. The days found between these two dates are automatically selected.

To allow the selection of a time period, "       Range selection" must be checked in the "Details" tab of the control description window.

At runtime, simply click the Calendar control to select a time period: click first to select the start date and click again to select the end date of the time period.


![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png)![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) If the "Today" button is displayed ("Details" tab of the description window), the context menu of this button proposes preset periods. The user can easily select the requested period.

To get the start and end date of the selected time period, simply use the [StartDate](../Proprietes/1000017426.md) and [EndDate](../Proprietes/1000017427.md) WLanguage properties.

Example:

```wl
NbDays is int 
NbDays = DateDifference(CAL_Calendar1.StartDate, CAL_Calendar1.EndDate) + 1
Info("Selected time period: from " + DateToString(CAL_Calendar1.StartDate) + ...
	" to " + DateToString(CAL_Calendar1.EndDate) + ...
	" which means " + NbDays + " day(s)")
```
