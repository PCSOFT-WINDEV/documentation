## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000112"></a>
A Spreadsheet control found in a window can be handled through programming. 

To handle a Spreadsheet control through programming, WINDEV proposes the [Spreadsheet functions](../WDLang1/1000023883.md). 

This help page explains how to handle a Spreadsheet control found in a window through programming. 

**Remark**: The method for handing a Spreadsheet control found in a report is different. For more details, see [Handling a Spreadsheet control through programming (in a report)](../WDChamp/1000033010.md).

### Initializing a Spreadsheet control
<a name="initializing_spreadsheet_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000173"></a>

The Spreadsheet control can be initialized with values, formulas, ... as soon as it is displayed according to different methods: 

- By programming, via the following functions: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [&lt;Spreadsheet&gt;.AddData](../WDLang1/1000023711.md) | Adds a data into a Spreadsheet control found in a window. |
| [&lt;Spreadsheet&gt;.AddFormula](../WDLang1/1000023713.md) | Adds a calculation formula into a Spreadsheet control found in a window. |
| [&lt;Spreadsheet&gt;.AllowProcedure](../WDLang1/1000023716.md) | Allows the use of a WLanguage function/procedure in a formula of a Spreadsheet control. |

- By loading an Excel file (in XLSX format) when initializing the control ([&lt;Spreadsheet&gt;.Load](../WDLang1/1000023719.md)). 

- Via direct input in the window editor. For more details, see [Initializing the Spreadsheet control in the window editor](../WDChamp/1000033008.md).

### Handling the Spreadsheet control
<a name="handling_the_spreadsheet_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000225"></a>

To handle a Spreadsheet control through programming, all you have to do is specify its name. 

For example: 


```wl
// Displays the formula bar
PSHEET_Spreadsheet.FormulaBarVisible = True
```

Several [WLanguage functions](../WDLang1/1000023883.md) and [properties](../WDChamp/1000033003.md) can be used to handle the Spreadsheet control.

<a name="NOTE3_1"></a>


## Handling the cells of a Spreadsheet control through programming
<a name="handling_the_cells_spreadsheet_control_through_programming_ELTTEXTE000242"></a>
<a name="NOTE3_3"></a>


### Handling the cells of the Spreadsheet control
<a name="handling_the_cells_the_spreadsheet_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000265"></a>**To handle a cell of a Spreadsheet control through programming** , use the following notations: 


```txt
<Spreadsheet control name>[<Row>, <Column>]
```
or 


```txt
<Spreadsheet control name>["<CellName>"]
```


Examples: 


```wl
// Colors the C1 cell in red
PSHEET_Spreadsheet[1,3].BackgroundColor = LightRed

// Colors the B1 cell in green
PSHEET_Spreadsheet["B1"].BackgroundColor = LightGreen
```


**To assign a value to a cell through programming**, you can use: 

- the [&lt;Spreadsheet&gt;.AddData](../WDLang1/1000023711.md) function. 
	Example: Adding a value into the "A2" cell: 
	
	```wl
	PSHEET_Spreadsheet.AddData(2, 1, 12)
	```


- the direct assignment: 

	- via the cell. 
			Example: Adding a value into the "A2" cell: 
			
		```wl
		PSHEET_Spreadsheet["A2"] = 12
		```


	- via the column and row of the cell. 
			Example: Adding a value into the "A2" cell: 
			
		```wl
		PSHEET_Spreadsheet["A"][2] = 12
		```






Remarks: 

- Assigning a value in 'YYYYMMDD' format to a cell in Date format automatically changes the value into date. 

- Assigning a value in 'HHMM' format to a cell in Time format automatically changes the value into time. 


**Example**: Browse the cells of a Spreadsheet control: 


```wl
// Browse the cells of a Spreadsheet control
sMyString is string
FOR I = 1 TO PSHEET_MySpreadsheet.NumberRow
	FOR y = 1 TO PSHEET_MySpreadsheet.NumberColumn
		sMyString += PSHEET_MySpreadsheet[i][y] + TAB
	END
	Trace(sMyString + CR)
	sMyString = ""
END
```

### Tip: Merging cells through programming
<a name="tip_merging_cells_through_programming_ELTPARAGRAPHE000324"></a>

The end user can merge the selected cells using the ribbon (or the toolbar) of the Spreadsheet control. 

To merge the selected cells through programming, simply use [ExecuteAAF](../WDLang1/3013060.md) associated with the constant *aafSpreadsheetMerge*: 

```wl
PSHEET_MySpreadsheet.SelectPlus("A1", "C5")
ExecuteAAF(PSHEET_MySpreadsheet, aafSpreadsheetMerge)
```
Remark: [&lt;Spreadsheet&gt;.GetMerge](../WDLang1/1000023731.md) is used to find out whether a cell is merged with other cells and to retrieve the range of merged cells.

### Managing the names of cells in a Spreadsheet control
<a name="managing_the_names_cells_spreadsheet_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000354"></a>The Spreadsheet control proposes several functions for handling the names of cells: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [&lt;Spreadsheet&gt;.AddName](../WDLang1/1000023715.md) | Specifies a name to identify a cell found in a Spreadsheet control. |
| [SpreadsheetDeleteName](../WDLang1/1000023447.md) | Deletes one of the names used to identify a cell found in a Spreadsheet control. |
| [SpreadsheetListName](../WDLang1/1000023448.md) | Returns the list of names that identify a cell in a Spreadsheet control. |
| [SpreadsheetModifyName](../WDLang1/1000023464.md) | Modifies the name used to identify a cell in a Spreadsheet control. |




<a name="NOTE2_6"></a>


### Managing comments in a Spreadsheet control
<a name="managing_comments_spreadsheet_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000399"></a>

The Spreadsheet control allows you to: 

- add comments,

- display existing comments in an XLSX file. 




Comments can be managed: 

- via the **Comment** advanced property. This property is used to find out and modify the comments associated to a cell via the following properties: 
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| Position | Name of the associated cell. <br><br>This property is read-only. |
| Rectangle | [Rectangle](../Motscles/1514079.md) variable. <br><br>Defines the rectangle in which the comment is displayed. The **Width** and **Height** properties determine the size of the rectangle (in millimeters), while **X** and **Y** determine the position of the comment (in millimeters with respect to the beginning of the current sheet. |
| Text | Comment text. |
| Visible | <br><br>	- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> to show the comment, <br><br>	- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> to make the comment invisible. In this case, a red triangle in the upper-right corner of the cell will let the user know that the cell is associated with a comment. <br><br><br> |


	Example: 
	
	```wl
	// Create a comment
	PSHEET_MySpreadsheet["B1"].Comment.Text = "Text of my comment"
	PSHEET_MySpreadsheet["B1"].Comment.Visible = True
	PSHEET_MySpreadsheet["B1"].Comment.Rectangle.Height = 50
	PSHEET_MySpreadsheet["B1"].Comment.Rectangle.Width = 50
	PSHEET_MySpreadsheet["B1"].Comment.Rectangle.X = 50
	PSHEET_MySpreadsheet["B1"].Comment.Rectangle.Y = 50
	```


- via different WLanguage functions: 
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [SpreadsheetListComment](../WDLang1/1000024881.md) | Lists all the comments on the current worksheet of a Spreadsheet control. |
| [SpreadsheetSelectComment](../WDLang1/1000024883.md) | Allows you to: <br><br>	- know if a comment is selected in a Spreadsheet control, <br><br>	- select or deselect a comment in a Spreadsheet control.<br><br><br> |

## Spreadsheet control: Handling a file containing several worksheets through programming
<a name="spreadsheet_control_handling_file_containing_several_worksheets_through_programming_ELTTEXTE000469"></a>
To enable the management of several worksheets: 

- In the editor: In the "Details" tab of the control description window, check "Allow multiple worksheets".

- Through programming, use the [MultiWorksheet](../Proprietes/1000021639.md) property. 




Once the management of several worksheets was enabled: 

- You have the ability to load the different worksheets of an XLSX file ([&lt;Spreadsheet&gt;.Load](../WDLang1/1000023719.md)). 

- Several functions are used to handle the different worksheets: 
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [&lt;Spreadsheet&gt;.AddWorksheet](../WDLang1/1000023712.md) | Adds a worksheet into a Spreadsheet control found in a window. |
| [&lt;Spreadsheet&gt;.DeleteWorksheet](../WDLang1/1000023741.md) | Deletes a worksheet from a Spreadsheet control found in a window. |
| [&lt;Spreadsheet&gt;.InsertWorksheet](../WDLang1/1000023726.md) | Inserts a worksheet into a Spreadsheet control found in a window. |
| [SpreadsheetListWorksheet](../WDLang1/1000023450.md) | Returns the list of worksheets found in a Spreadsheet control. |
| [&lt;Spreadsheet&gt;.SelectWorksheet](../WDLang1/1000023736.md) | Selects a worksheet (identified by its name) in a Spreadsheet control. |

- Several properties are used to handle the different worksheets: 
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [CurrentWorksheet](../Proprietes/1000021640.md) | The **CurrentWorksheet** property is used to get and change the current worksheet in a Spreadsheet control. |
| [MultiWorksheet](../Proprietes/1000021639.md) | The **MultiWorksheet** property is used to: <br><br>	- Find out whether a Spreadsheet control manages several worksheets. <br><br>	- Change the worksheet management mode of a Spreadsheet control.<br><br><br> |
| [NbWorksheet](../Proprietes/1000021641.md) | The **NbWorksheet** property is used to get the number of worksheets in a Spreadsheet control. |
| [WorksheetName](../Proprietes/1000021646.md) | The **WorksheetName** property is used to get or change the name of the current worksheet in a Spreadsheet control. |

- Several AAFs (Automatic Application Features) allows the user to manage the different worksheets.
