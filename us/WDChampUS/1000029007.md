### "General" tab
<a name="general_tab_ELTPARAGRAPHE000020"></a>

The "General" tab found in the description of the Pivot Table control is used to define: 

- the **position of displayed values**: Several values can be displayed in the Pivot Table control. The values can be displayed: 

	- side by side:

	- one below another:

- the **position of totals**: The Pivot Table control can calculate the totals of displayed values. The totals can: 

	- be displayed at the bottom right (at the end of row and column). 

	- be hidden. 

	- be displayed at the bottom only (at the end of column). 

	- be displayed on the right only (at the end of row). 


The option "Totals always visible" allows you to display the totals at the end of the row and/or column even if the row or column is not fully displayed. In this case, the totals are always visible.

### "UI" tab
<a name="tab_ELTPARAGRAPHE000045"></a>

The "UI" tab is mainly used to: 

- define the initial status of the control. 

- define the context menu associated with the control (menu of AAFs, custom menu, ...). 

- define the **selection mode**. The option "Allow the multiple selection of rows, columns and cells" allows the user to select several columns, rows or cells at the same time. The options proposed by the menu of AAFs are applied to all the selected cells (copy, background color, ...). 
	You also have the ability to define the selection mode through programming with [Multi-selection](../Proprietes/1000017054.md).

### "Details" tab
<a name="details_tab_ELTPARAGRAPHE000067"></a>

The "Details" tab mainly allows you to: 

- configure scrollbars and tooltips (with the possibility to display a tooltip on truncated elements). 

- enable line wrapping in the row headers. You can also configure this option programmatically, using the [AutoLineWrap](../Proprietes/1000021868.md) property. 

- save the user settings. These settings will be restored automatically the next time the window is opened.

### "Content" tab
<a name="content_tab_ELTPARAGRAPHE000083"></a>

The "Content" tab allows you to view and configure the different elements of the Pivot Table control. This tab is divided into several sections: 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=TCD_Contenu.gif&type=thumb)


**1. Source file of the Pivot Table control**. This file corresponds to the data file containing the value used for the calculation. For example, the OrdLine data file to calculate sales.

**2. Display filters** (advanced use). This list allows you to view the display filter(s) used on the Pivot Table control. These filters can be used by [PVTFilter](../WDLang1/1000020531.md). 
To add or modify the filters, all you have to do is click inside the section. The details of filters are displayed. 
To create a new filter: 

1. Click "Add". 

2. Define the link from the source file to reach the item that will be used as filter and validate. 

3. In the right section of the screen, define the characteristics of the displayed value. 

4. To go back to the initial "Content" tab, click the arrow at the top of the screen (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=TCD_Fleche_retour.gif)
). 




**3. Rows**. This list is used to view the items displayed on the row headers of the Pivot Table control. These items are used to group the data. 
To add or modify the row headers, all you have to do is click inside the section. The details of the row headers are displayed. 
The following information is displayed for each row header: 

- in the table, the link between the source file and the header. 

- on the right, the characteristics of the value displayed in the row header: 

	- Displayed source. The red arrow is used to defined the sort on the source. 

	- Filter applied onto the displayed source. For more details, see [Filtering the headers](../WDChamp/1000029005.md). 

	- Name of header (to be used through programming)

	- Display mask of header

	- Default status of header (collapsed or expanded). 





To add a new row header: 

1. Click "Add". 

2. Define the link from the source file to reach the item that will be displayed as header and validate. 

3. In the right section of the screen, define the characteristics of the displayed value. 


To go back to the initial "Content" tab, click the arrow at the top of the screen (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=TCD_Fleche_retour.gif)
). 

**4. Columns**. This list is used to view the items displayed on the column headers of the Pivot Table control. These items are used to group the data. 
To add or modify the column headers, all you have to do is click inside the section. The details of the column headers are displayed. 
The following information is displayed for each column header: 

- in the table, the link between the source file and the header. 

- on the right, the characteristics of the value displayed in the column header: 

	- Displayed source. The red arrow is used to defined the sort on the source. 

	- Filter applied onto the displayed source. For more details, see [Filtering the headers](../WDChamp/1000029005.md). 

	- Name of header (to be used through programming)

	- Display mask of header

	- Default status of header (collapsed or expanded). 





To add a new column header: 

1. Click "Add". 

2. Define the link from the source file to reach the item that will be displayed as header and validate. 

3. In the right section of the screen, define the characteristics of the displayed value. 


To go back to the initial "Content" tab, click the arrow at the top of the screen (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=TCD_Fleche_retour.gif)
). 

**5. Values to display in the Pivot Table control**. This list is used to view the values displayed in the cells of the Pivot Table control. 
To add, modify, delete or re-organize these values, all you have to do is click inside the section. The details of the values are displayed.  

The characteristics of values are grouped in 3 themes: 

- General: Used to define: 

	- the name of the value. This name is used to handle the value through programming. 

	- the caption of each value displayed in the cell. 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WD%20-%20TCD%20Libelle%20Cellules.gif)
You can also change this text programmatically, using the [Caption](../Proprietes/2510053.md) property. 




- Calculation: Used to define the calculation performed, the source used and the display mask for the value in the table. 

- Display: Used to define the display options of the value: alignment, reset, caption of total (in rows or in columns), ...
	You can also define the "eye-magnet" (conditional formatting) on the values: you can for example display in red all the cells of a Pivot Table control whose value is negative.




To go back to the initial "Content" tab, click the arrow at the top of the screen (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=TCD_Fleche_retour.gif)
