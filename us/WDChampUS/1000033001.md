<a name="overview_spreadsheet_control_ELTTEXTE000107"></a>
Spreadsheets are one of the most used office tools.

The "Spreadsheet" control is a native control: it doesn't require a spreadsheet software to be installed on the computer (and therefore no license to manage).

With this control, no more navigation between applications, no external software to control!

Some benefits of this control: 

- The content of Spreadsheet control can be saved (or loaded) in Excel format directly (XLSX format). 

- The Spreadsheet control is compatible with Excel, OpenOfficeCalc, FreeOffice, ... 

- The Spreadsheet control supports Excel worksheets (XLSX). 

- The Spreadsheet control supports XLTX and XLTM files (Excel templates). If a template file is opened in the Spreadsheet control, a new workbook is automatically created with that template.  


This compatibility allows you to reuse existing spreadsheets or calculations performed in the Spreadsheet control.

The Spreadsheet control also supports protected worksheets and locked cells. The worksheet password is requested when making changes.
