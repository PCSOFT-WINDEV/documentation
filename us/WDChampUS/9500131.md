## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000272"></a>
One of the most common applications of the multi-touch feature is used to handle images. Since mobile devices usually have smaller screens, sometimes it is necessary to zoom and move images. 

This technology allows you to zoom images with a pinch gesture. 

The multi-touch can be implemented: 

- on the applications run on a phone. 

- on the sites displayed on a phone. 




The management of multi-touch in the Image controls can be implemented via: 

- [Specific options available in the control description](#NOTE2_1).

- [Specific optional events](#NOTE3_1).

## Image control description: Options specific to multi-touch
<a name="image_control_description_options_specific_multitouch_ELTTEXTE000296"></a>
The "Details" tab in the window description of the Image control is used to manage the actions performed when using the fingers: 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=multitouch.gif)
The following options are supported: 

- **No scroll, no zoom**: in this case, multi-touch is disabled. 

- **Automatic scrolling only**: If the image is not displayed in its entirety the control, it can be moved by scrolling with the finger.

- **Automatic scroll and zoom**: In addition to scrolling, zoom is also supported. In this case: 

	- moving two fingers away from each other on the screen allows zooming in. The zoom will be centered on the point found in the middle of the line drawn by the two contact points.

	- moving two fingers towards each other on the screen allows zooming out. 







The additional options are used to define: 

- **Maximum zoom factor**: Maximum zoom that can be performed with the fingers. 

- **Allow zoom by double tap**: In this case, a double tap (or double click) performed in the control is used to apply the zoom on an image section. If the image is already zoomed, it is reinitialized to its initial display.

## Optional events specific to multi-touch
<a name="optional_events_specific_multitouch_ELTTEXTE000326"></a>
There are three specific optional events to manage multi-touch on Image controls: 

- [Touch scrolling](#NOTE3_2)

- [Horizontal and vertical swipe](#NOTE3_3)

- [Pinch zoom](#NOTE3_4)

### Scroll with finger optional event
<a name="scroll_with_finger_optional_event_ELTPARAGRAPHE000134"></a>

The "Scroll with finger" event is run when one or more fingers move vertically or horizontally while in contact with the screen

This event can accept parameters by declaring a procedure directly in the event "Scroll with finger" with the following syntax: 

```txt
PROCEDURE <Procedure name>(<Distance X>, <Distance Y>)
```
where: 

- &lt;Distance X&gt;: Integer corresponding to the distance (in pixels) that was scrolled on the X axis in the control.

- &lt;Distance Y&gt;: Integer corresponding to the distance (in pixels) that was scrolled on the Y axis in the control.




Remarks:

### Horizontal and vertical swipe
<a name="horizontal_and_vertical_swipe_ELTPARAGRAPHE000167"></a>

The "Horizontal and vertical swipe" event is run during a quick small movement of one or more fingers on the screen. 

This event can accept parameters by declaring a procedure directly in the event "Horizontal and vertical swipe" with the following syntax: 


```txt
PROCEDURE <Procedure name>(<Speed X>, <Speed Y>)
```
where: 

- &lt;Speed X&gt;: Integer corresponding to the speed (in pixels per second) of the movement on the X axis.

- &lt;Speed Y&gt;: Integer corresponding to the speed (in pixels per second) of the movement on the Y axis.

### "Zoom with fingers" optional process
<a name="zoom_with_fingers_optional_process_ELTPARAGRAPHE000191"></a>

The "Zoom with fingers" event is run with a pinch or spread finger gesture on the screen. 

This event can accept parameters by declaring a procedure directly in the event "Zoom with fingers" with the following syntax: 

```txt
PROCEDURE <Procedure name>(<Spacing>)
```
where &lt;Spacing&gt;: Integer corresponding to the distance (in pixels) between the two contact points when the event was called.





**Caution**: The zoom with finger is not available if [dStartDrawing](../WDLang1/3029009.md) is used on the Image control. In this case, you must: 

- save the image with a dSaveImageXXX function. 

- use the [dEndDrawing](../WDLang1/3029019.md) function. 

- redisplay the image in the Image control.
