### Static control
<a name="static_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000105"></a>

The "Static" control is used to display different types of data: 

- text, RTF, HTML, Markdown,
	

- numeric, currency, currency + Euro,

- date, 

- time, duration. 




To specify the type of data displayed in the control: 

1. Go to the "General" tab in the Static control description window ("Description" in the control context menu).

2. Select the type of information displayed ("Type" combo box).

3. Validate.




The displayed data can contain: 

- the data from an item (or variable) in the report data source.
	Remark: The item or variable bound to the control is defined in the "Binding" tab of the control description window. 

- the content of another control found in the report.

- a value defined through programming.




**To insert the value of a report item or control into the text of the Static control**, enter the item or control name between [% and %].

For example, the text of the control can correspond to: The [%SupplierName%] supplier sells the [%ProductName%] product at [%PriceIOT%]. SupplierName, ProductName and PriceIOT will be replaced with their value when the report is executed.

**Remark**: If the Static control must display a text on several lines, all you have to do is choose the "Multiline text" type. In this case, the control size must be large enough. 
**Reminder**: The "Auto-resizing" option ("UI" tab in the control description window) is used to automatically enlarge the control according to its content when printing.

Examples:

**Modifying the caption of a Static control**
The caption of a "Static" control can be modified:

- through programming ([Libellé](../Proprietes/2510053.md) property).

- in the report editor. In this case, two methods are available:

	- Method 1:

		1. Select the control. The selection handles appear around the control.

		2. Click the control again. The mouse cursor turns into an input cursor.

		3. Enter the new text.

		4. Modify (if necessary) the formatting of the caption:

			- for a text caption: via the formatting options on the "Modification" tab, in the "Quick edit" group:
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Etat_EditionRapide.gif)


			- for an RTF caption: via the formatting toolbar that is displayed above the control:
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Etat_BarreRTF.gif)

- Method 2:

	1. Select the control.

	2. Display the description window of control ("Description" from the popup menu of control).

	3. Enter the new text in each language supported by the control.

	4. Modify (if necessary) the formatting in the "Style" tab.
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Etat_LibelleStyle.gif)




**Multilingual Static control**
If your application or your site is multilingual, a different caption can be typed for each language supported by the report.
The corresponding caption will be printed according to the runtime language of project.

**"Currency + Euro" Static control**
For a "Currency + Euro" Static control, you have the ability to manage:

- the stored currency: currency of the data in the report data source. If the control is handled through programming, the currency used for the value will be the stored currency.

- the display currency: currency used to display the value when printing the report. This currency can differ from the stored currency. The conversion is automatically performed.

- the dual display: two "Currency + Euro" controls can be bound. In this case, the report editor distinguishes between two types of controls:

	- the base control: this control contains the value in the report data source.

	- the tracker control: this control is used to display the value of base control in the selected currency.

### Calculated control
<a name="calculated_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000240"></a>

The "Calculated" control is used to perform calculations in a report. These calculations can be made:

- on an item of the data source.

- on a control found in the report.

- programmatically.




Examples:

![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Champ_Calcule.gif)
**Specific "Calculated" control: "Currency + Euro"**
For a "Currency + Euro" Calculated control, you have the ability to manage:

- the stored currency: currency of the data in the report data source. If the control is handled through programming, the currency used for the value will be the stored currency.

- the display currency: currency used to display the value when printing the report. This currency can differ from the stored currency. The conversion is automatically performed.

- the dual display: two "Currency + Euro" controls can be bound. In this case, the report editor distinguishes between two types of controls:

	- the base control: this control contains the value in the report data source.

	- the tracker control: this control is used to display the value of base control in the selected currency.







For more details, see [Currency + Euro type](../WDLang1/3033007.md) and [Calculated control](../WDChamp/1013212.md).

	- The "Catalog" button is used to choose an image found in the image catalog of WINDEV.




- correspond to the content of an item found in the data source (for example, if the data source is an HFSQL file, the item can be an Image memo or a character string containing the full image path). The "Image" control is bound to this item.
	Remark: The item (or variable) bound to the control is defined in the "Binding" tab of the control description window. 




**Multilingual images**
If your application or your site is multilingual, a different image can be selected for each language supported by the report. This option is useful for images with text, for example.
The corresponding image will be printed according to the runtime language of project.
To select image for each language, click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Menu_Image_Editeur%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)

**Information specific to chart creation**

A chart creation wizard starts automatically. This wizard is used to enter the information required to create the Chart control. This information is as follows:

- the type of chart (stock, pie, line, ...).

- the chart parameters: title, legend, 3D chart, display of labels, ...

- the parameters of axes: titles, grid, ...

- the characteristics of series: 

	- the source and data displayed by the category labels (programming, data file, query, WLanguage array, report data source). ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=EtiquetteCategorie.gif)


	- the name of series (used for the series labels): ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=EtiquetteSerie.gif)




**Remark**: if the data source corresponds to the report data source, you can define: 

- the fill block,

- the control or the item corresponding to the series,

- the selection mode of data. 




For more details, see [Chart control](../WDChamp/1013006.md).
<a name="NOTE2_9"></a>


### Shape control
<a name="shape_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000423"></a>

A "Shape" control is used to insert geometric shapes into a report. You have the ability to insert:

- horizontal or vertical lines,

- circles,

- rectangles (with straight or rounded borders).




The line style, thickness and color can be entirely configured.
<a name="NOTE2_10"></a>


### Check Box control
<a name="check_box_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000436"></a>

A "Check box" control corresponds to a box to check.

If the control value is set to <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>, the box is checked: ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Interrupteur_CaseCochee.gif)


If the control value is set to <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>, the box is unchecked: ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Interrupteur_CaseDecochee.gif)


A "Check box" control can be bound to an item or variable in the report data source. For example, if the data source corresponds to an HFSQL file, the item can be a boolean or a check box.

The size, the background color and the color of check box can be configured.

Example:
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Champ_Interrupteur-Etat.gif)
**Remark**: The item or variable bound to the control is defined in the "Binding" tab of the control description window. 
<a name="NOTE2_11"></a>


### Internal Report control
<a name="internal_report_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000465"></a>

The "Internal report" controls are used to print several reports (secondary reports) in a single report (main report) without programming.

For example, the following main report is made of two secondary reports printed side-by-side:

- a report displaying the data in a table.

- a report displaying the data in a chart. 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=EtatInterne.gif&type=thumb)







**Benefits of internal reports compared to the nested reports**
The report editor can also be used to simultaneously print several reports via nested reports. However, the nested reports are a bit more complicated to use. Indeed, the nested reports require:

- the call to [iPrintReport](../WDLang5/3046032.md) to print the secondary report.

- the obligation to print the nested report after the main report. These reports cannot be printed side by side.




The internal reports allow you to print several reports without programming:

- one below another, 

- side by side.




For more details, see [Nested reports](../WDChamp/1011001.md).
<a name="NOTE2_12"></a>


### URL Link control
<a name="url_link_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000508"></a>

A "URL link" control is used to insert links into a report. You have the ability to insert:

- a link to an email address,

- a link to an Internet site,

- ...




The "URL Link" control is enabled only if the report is printed in an HTML file. Otherwise, the "URL link" control is visible but it is disabled. In the case of a printout in PDF format, only the links corresponding to an Address of a site or an Page are active. 

Example: 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Champ_Lien.gif&type=thumb)


**Remark**: The item or variable bound to the control is defined in the "Binding" tab of the control description window. 
<a name="NOTE2_13"></a>


### Edit control
<a name="edit_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000526"></a>

An edit control is used to type and display text in a report. You can use an edit control:

- to allow the user to type the information to print,

- to allow the user to modify the information to print,

- ...




The edit control is enabled only if the report is displayed in "Print preview" mode or if it is printed in a PDF file. In the other cases, the edit control is visible but it is disabled.

**Characteristics of edit controls**
When creating an edit control in a report, you have the ability to define:

- the type of control (text, numeric, date, time), 

- the associated mask: the available masks are the ones supported by the PDF format. They are available for the numerics, the dates and the times.

- the input size, which means the maximum number of characters allowed in the control. If this parameter is set to 0, there is no limit.

- the horizontal alignment,

- the initial value,

- the style of caption and input area.




**Remarks**:

- Multiline edit control: if the users enter more lines than what is visible, the non-visible lines will not be printed. During the input, the edit controls manage a vertical scrollbar.

- Style of input area: In this version, only the "Arial" font can be used.

- The edit control is not bound to an item in a data file or query. To display information coming form a file or from a query, the control must be assigned by programming.

- The borders of the input area cannot be configured (thickness, color, etc.).

- No currency type can be used (the Euro symbol is not supported).
