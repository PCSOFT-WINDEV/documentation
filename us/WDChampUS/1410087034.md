## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000162"></a>
WINDEV allows you to handle an Image Editor control through programming. To do so, use the control variable in the code.

Image Editor controls can also be handled programmatically via [Picxxx functions](../WDLang1/1000023383.md). These functions are used to create, save, open and close an image in an Image Editor control. 

This help page explains how to handle an Image Editor control through programming.

## Displaying an image in an Image Editor control
<a name="displaying_image_image_editor_control_ELTTEXTE000186"></a>
To display an image in an Image Editor control, you can: 

- use an assignment (direct or by variable) with path of image file. 
	
	```wl
	// Direct assignment
	IE_MyImage = "C:\Temp\MyImage.bmp"
	// Assignment by variable
	ImagePath = fCurrentDir() + "\MyImage.bmp"
	IE_MyImage = ImagePath
	```


- use an assignment with an [Image](../WDLang1/1000019650.md) variable.
	
	```wl
	MyImage is Image
	// Load from a file
	MyImage = dLoadImage("image.png")
	// Assign the Image Editor control
	IE_MyImage = MyImage
	```





Remark: To get the path of the image file displayed in an Image Editor control, use the [FilePath](../Proprietes/1000023104.md) property.

## Clearing or reinitializing the content of an Image Editor control
<a name="clearing_reinitializing_the_content_image_editor_control_ELTTEXTE000210"></a>
To clear or reinitialize an Image Editor control, all you have to do is assign an empty string to the Image Editor control. For example:

```wl
IE_MyImage = ""
```
Remark: You can also use [PicClose](../WDLang1/1000023382.md).

## Setting the default options in an Image Editor control
<a name="setting_the_default_options_image_editor_control_ELTTEXTE000234"></a>
You can: 

- define the tool used by default when opening the Image Editor control with the [InitialTool](../Proprietes/1410088609.md) property. 

- set the default dimensions when creating a new image in the Image Editor control with the [ImageInitialHeight](../Proprietes/1410088607.md) and [ImageInitialWidth](../Proprietes/1410088608.md) properties.

## Handling the image displayed in the Image Editor control
<a name="handling_the_image_displayed_the_image_editor_control_ELTTEXTE000258"></a>
To handle the image found in the Image Editor control, we recommend that you use an [Image](../WDLang1/1000019650.md)variable. Then, all the [drawing functions](../WDLang1/3029033.md) can be used on this [Image](../WDLang1/1000019650.md) variable. To update the Image Editor control, all you have to do is assign the control with the [Image](../WDLang1/1000019650.md) variable. 

It is also possible to use a variable of type [WDPic](../WDLang1/1000023503.md). This variable is mainly used to manage the display of layers in a ".wdpic" file.

### Properties specific to the management of Image Editor controls
<a name="properties_specific_the_management_image_editor_controls_ELTPARAGRAPHE000106"></a>

The following properties are used to manage the characteristics of an Image Editor control through programming: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [FilePath](../Proprietes/1000023104.md) | The **FilePath** property is used to identify: <br><br>- the name of the xlsx file associated with a Spreadsheet control.<br><br>- the name of the file associated with an Image Editor control. <br><br>- the name of the PDF file associated with a PDF Reader control. <br><br>- the name of the DOCX file associated with a Word Processing control. <br><br>- the name of the wddiag file associated with a Diagram Editor control. <br><br><br> |
| [ImageInitialHeight](../Proprietes/1410088607.md) | The **ImageInitialHeight** property is used to get and set the default height of the image created in an Image Editor control. |
| [ImageInitialWidth](../Proprietes/1410088608.md) | The **ImageInitialWidth** property is used to get and set the default width of the image created in an Image Editor control. |
| [ImageType](../Proprietes/1000023516.md) | The **ImageType** property is used to get the type of image being edited in an Image Editor control (icon or image). |
| [InitialTool](../Proprietes/1410088609.md) | The **InitialTool** property is used to get or change the drawing tool selected by default in an Image Editor control. |
| [PaneVisible](../Proprietes/1000023515.md) | The **PaneVisible** property is used to: <br><br>- determine if the pane of the Image Editor control is visible, <br><br>- show or hide the pane of the Image Editor control.<br><br><br> |
