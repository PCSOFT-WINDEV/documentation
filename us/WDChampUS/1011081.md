## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000241"></a>
A report based on an Organizer control is used to directly print the information displayed in an Organizer control found:

- in a window or page of the application. This window or page must be displayed when printing the report.

- in an internal window or an internal page: 

	- The window displaying the internal window must be displayed.

	- The page displaying the internal page must be displayed.

However, you have the ability to customize the reports on Organizer control created in the standard report editor (color, fonts, size, ...). |



**Remark**: Only an Organizer report can be created on an Organizer control.

## Characteristics of the report based on an Organizer control
<a name="characteristics_the_report_based_organizer_control_ELTTEXTE000283"></a>
All the rows and columns found in the Organizer control are displayed in the Organizer report. 

When creating the report, you can specify the number of days to display and the display mode of resources (in rows or columns). 

A report based on an Organizer control can be created from the report editor: to do so, select an Organizer report based on an Organizer control. 

Once the report based on the Organizer control is created, you can: 

- change the data source of the report ("Data" tab in the report description).

- modify the characteristics of the organizer ("General" tab of the organizer description). 




**Caution**: The test of a report based on an Organizer control cannot be run from the report editor because the window or the page containing the Organizer control must be opened. To run the test of a report based on an Organizer control, you must:

- create (if necessary) a button in the window or in the page of the Organizer control. This button can be used to print the report with the data from the Organizer control ([iPrintReport](../WDLang5/3046032.md)). 
	Case of internal windows or internal pages: If the Organizer control is found in an internal window or in an internal page, we advise you to create the button in the internal window/page (and not in the host window/page).

- run the test of the window containing the Organizer control then run the report test (via the button).
	Case of internal windows: the test must be run from the window that is hosting the internal window.

- run the test of the page containing the Organizer control then run the report test (via the button).
	Case of internal pages: the test must be run from the page that hosts the internal page.

## Creating a report based on an Organizer control from the report editor
<a name="creating_report_based_organizer_control_from_the_report_editor_ELTTEXTE000307"></a>
The report editor allows you to create an Organizer report based on an Organizer control.

Once the report is created, the print must be programmed in WLanguage. For more details, see "Printing a report based on an Organizer control".

### Creating a report based on an Organizer control from the report editor
<a name="creating_report_based_organizer_control_from_the_report_editor_ELTPARAGRAPHE000069"></a>

To create a report based on an Organizer control from the report editor: 

1. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_nouveau.gif)
 in the quick access buttons. 

	- The new element window appears: click "Report" then "Report". 

	- The report creation wizard starts.




2. Choose an "Organizer or Scheduler" report. 

3. Select "Organizer report" and enter the characteristics of the report: 

	- Display mode, 

	- Number of days to display, 

	- Granularity of gridlines. 
			For more details on these options, see [Organizer report](../WDChamp/1011079.md). 




4. Select the data source of the report ("From an Organizer control").

5. Select the Organizer control on which the report will be based. Only the Organizer controls found in the windows or pages of the current project are proposed.
	**Remark**: If the selected control and the report do not have the same characteristics, the report editor proposes to modify the display of the report.

6. Specify the format of sheet on which the report will be printed. The report is printed in A4 format by default.

7. Type the name and title of the report (name of ".WDE" file corresponding to the report). This name will be used to identify the report in your programs.
	![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) You can also specify whether the report can be modified by the end user in "Reports & Queries". 

8. Validate the report creation. 

9. Specify (if necessary) the mode for reducing the report size: 

	- Print the report on several pages. In this case, the end user will have to group the pages. For more details, see [Multi-page print](../WDChamp/1011065.md). 

	- Use the landscape mode. 

	- Reduce the report size. Caution: according to the reduction percentage, the printed report may become unreadable. 




10. The report currently created is displayed in the report editor.

### Printing a report based on an Organizer control
<a name="printing_report_based_organizer_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000118"></a>

A report based on an Organizer control must be printed from the window (or from the page) displaying the Organizer control to print. To do so:

1. Create a button in the window (or page) containing the Organizer control.

2. Configure the report print destination:

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) In WINDEV, with [iDestination](../WDLang5/3046074.md) (report viewer, print in an HTML file, etc.).

	- 
			For more details, see [Print modes of a report](../WDChamp/1011031.md).




3. Specify the name of the report to print with [iPrintReport](../WDLang5/3046032.md).




**Remarks**:

- If additional parameters must be passed to the report, these parameters must be specified in [iPrintReport](../WDLang5/3046032.md), after the name of the report to print. For more details, see [Report with parameters](../WDChamp/1011008.md).

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) If the window that contains the source Organizer control is opened multiple times (non-modal opening with [OpenChild](../WDLang1/3038021.md)), the full name of the Organizer control to be printed must be passed as parameter to the report. For example: 
	
	```wl
	// The FullName property will contain the name of the window
	// that must be opened with an alias to distinguish between each window
	iPrintReport(RPT_Customer_Organizer, ORG_Customer.FullName)
	```

	```wl
	// Opening code of the report
	PROCEDURE RPT_Customer_Organizer(NameSourceOrganizer)
	MyReport.SourceName = NameSourceOrganizer
	```

| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ER.png)<br> | Important | In [Reports & Queries](../Presentation/3088004.md), you can print a report:<br><br>- by starting a print job (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Ico_Imprimer.gif)<br>). <br><br>- by testing the report (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Ico_Go_Fenetre_WD_bl.gif)<br>). <br><br><br>Therefore, no programming is required to print the report. |

### WINDEV example
<a name="windev_example_ELTPARAGRAPHE000186"></a>

The information to print is in the Organizer control named "ORG_CustomerOrganizer" found in the "WIN_Customer" window.

The report to print is named "RPT_CustomerOrganizer" and it is printed when "BTN_Print" is clicked on.

In this example, the click code of "BTN_Print" is as follows:


```wl
// Open report viewer
iDestination(iViewer)
 
// Print the report based on "ORG_CustomerOrganizer" 
iPrintReport(RPT_CustomerOrganizer)
```
