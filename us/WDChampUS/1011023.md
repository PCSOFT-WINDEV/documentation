<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000140"></a>
A report provides a **custom view of data**: data entered in the database, data found in a text file, data coming from a Table control, ...

Depending on the product used, the data found in the report can be displayed in different formats:

- **In WINDEV**: 

	- In a Windows application, a report can be displayed on the screen, saved in an HTML file, printed on a printer, ...

	- In a Linux application, a report can be saved in a PDF file. 




- **In WEBDEV**, a report can be saved in a file (HTML or PDF), sent by email, displayed in the browser of the Web user or printed on a printer connected to the server, ...

- **In WINDEV Mobile**: 

	- In an **iOS** application, a report can be saved in a PDF file. 

	- In an application **in Universal Windows App mode**, a report can be saved in a PDF file.

## What are the elements of a report?
<a name="what_are_the_elements_report_ELTTEXTE000164"></a>
A report includes:

- ***blocks*** that define the different sections of the report (for more details, see [Report blocks](../WDChamp/1011040.md)).

- ***controls*** in which the report data is displayed (for more details, see [Report controls](../WDChamp/1013211.md)).




A report can be used to summarize and synthesize data. You can: 

- group data, 

- sort data according to any criterion, 

- perform calculations (means, statistics) or create charts, 

- display the data in several columns.




Just think of a report and the report editor will create it.

## Simplified definition of a report
<a name="simplified_definition_report_ELTTEXTE000188"></a>
The diagrams below present a simple definition of a report:

- the data to print comes from a data source (data file, HFSQL view, query, memory area, WLanguage variable or text file, etc.).

- the report groups, sorts and formats the data.

- the report execution can be directed to: 

	- in WINDEV: the screen, a file (PDF, HTML, RTF), a printer or a fax, ...

	- in WEBDEV: a file( HTML, RTF, PDF, etc.), a printer or a fax, ... If the report destination is a file, this file can be sent to the browser. 

	- in WINDEV Mobile: a PDF file (for iOS, Android, or Universal Windows Apps).
