## Overview of Captcha control
<a name="overview_captcha_control_ELTTEXTE000192"></a>
The "captcha" are the distorted texts that the Web user must decode and re-enter in a site before validating a form. 

The purpose of the "captcha" is to prevent the hackers from attacking a site via a robot that would enter cascading information.

By implementing this type of security in a form, you can be almost sure that the information was entered by a human being!

**The principle is straightforward**: the Captcha control automatically calculates and displays the distorted image corresponding to a text. This text is automatically generated by the control or defined by the application.

## Creating a Captcha control
<a name="creating_captcha_control_ELTTEXTE000216"></a>
To create a Captcha control: 

1. On the "Creation" tab, in the "Graphic controls" group, click "Captcha".

2. Click where you want to create the control in the page. The control appears in the editor.


To view the characteristics of the control, select "Description" in the context menu.

Remark: WEBDEV includes several Smart controls that can be used to create Captcha controls. To view and use these controls, go to the "Creation" tab, "Graphic controls" group and expand "Captcha". The available Smart controls are: 

- Captcha security code

- Button protected by Google reCaptcha

- Button protected by Google reCaptcha with check box. 


You can adapt the code of these Smart controls.

### Configuring a Captcha control
<a name="configuring_captcha_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000066"></a>

Several characteristics of the Captcha control can be modified in the editor, in the description window of the control ("Description" in the context menu of the control). 

In the "General" tab, you can define: 

- the number of characters that must be displayed in the Captcha control. 

- the range of authorized characters: lowercase characters and/or uppercase characters and/or digits.




In the "Style" tab, you have the ability to define: 

- the color of captcha. 

- the font used. We recommend that you use simple fonts in order for the captcha to be legible.

### Implementation and use
<a name="implementation_and_use_ELTPARAGRAPHE000085"></a>

To use a Captcha control: 

1. Create the Captcha control and modify its characteristics if necessary (font, range of characters, ...). Create an edit control in which the Web user will enter the value of the captcha. 

2. Initialize the Captcha control with the requested value. You can: 

	- use [CaptchaDisplay](../WDLang2/1000019389.md). This function is used to generate a random value for the captcha according to the specified parameters. 

	- assign a value to the Captcha control via a simple assignment: 
			
		```txt
		<Name of Captcha Control> = <Captcha Value>
		```

			For example: 
			
		```wl
		CPTCH_Captcha = "ToTo1567"
		```



 **Tip**: Depending on the letters and digits used by the captcha, this one may be difficult to decode. Don't forget to create a button used to generate a new captcha upon request. All you have to do is call [CaptchaDisplay](../WDLang2/1000019389.md) in the code of the button to get a new captcha. You will notice that algorithm used to build the captcha changes for each display, increasing the security level automatically. The distortion changes for each display.

3. Checks whether the value typed by the Web user corresponds to the Captcha control via [CaptchaVerify](../WDLang2/1000019390.md). 




**Remarks**: 

- The Captcha controls can also be handled via the [prefix syntax of Captcha functions](../WDLang2/1000019584.md). 

- Several properties are used to modify the aspect of a Captcha control. For more details, see [Captcha control properties](../WDChamp/1000019450.md).

- To use a Captcha control in an application that supports specific character sets, you can: 

	- use a Google captcha suggested by the Smart controls. The captcha will use characters supported in the current language. 

	- use the Captcha control and allow numbers only (option available in the "General" tab of the control description).

WEBDEV handles the following event by default:

| Event | Runtime condition |
| --- | --- |
| Initializing (Server code) | Executed when the page is opened. |
