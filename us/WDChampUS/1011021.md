## Overview

By default, the "Print" icon allows the Web user to print the current site page (Ctrl + P). However, depending on the page layout, the print may be incomplete (truncated lines, images too large, etc.).

WEBDEV allows you to easily print reports in static and dynamic sites (in Session or AWP mode).

A WEBDEV report is used to format the information in order for the Web user to get a perfect print.

WEBDEV proposes several methods for printing a report. A report can be:

- [displayed in the browser of the Web user in PDF format](../WDChamp/1011015.md). The final print will be managed by the software for viewing the PDF file.

- [downloaded on the computer of the Web user in PDF format](../WDChamp/1011005.md).

- [displayed in the browser of the Web user in HTML format](../WDChamp/1011051.md).

- [printed on one of the printers connected to the Web server](../WDChamp/1011002.md) (intranet sites only).
