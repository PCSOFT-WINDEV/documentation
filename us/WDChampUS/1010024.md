## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000161"></a>
The following types of windows can be created in a WINDEV application:

- **MDI**: 
	These windows must respect some constraints specific to the MDI applications. Three types of windows are available: MDI parent window, MDI child window and MDI sibling window. 
	The child windows and the sibling windows are opened in non-modal mode. For more details, see [Non-modal management of a window](../WDChamp/1010022.md).

- **non-MDI**: 
	These windows have no specific constraint. These windows can be opened in modal mode or in non-modal mode. 
	For more details, see [Modal windows](../WDChamp/1010028.md)
	For more details, see [Non-modal management of a window](../WDChamp/1010022.md).

### Characteristics of the MDI parent windows
<a name="characteristics_the_mdi_parent_windows_ELTPARAGRAPHE000039"></a>

An MDI parent window must necessarily be the first window of a WINDEV project. This window is used to display all the application windows.

An MDI parent window has the following characteristics (not modifiable):

- modifiable borders

- minimize button, maximize button, system menu

- title bar

- icon bar

- ability to include a drop-down menu and toolbars.




In an MDI parent window, only the controls found in the "icon bar" area can be edited. Outside this area, no control can be in edit, no mouse click is active.

### Characteristics of the MDI child windows
<a name="characteristics_the_mdi_child_windows_ELTPARAGRAPHE000056"></a>

All the MDI child windows have the same characteristics (that cannot be modified):

- modifiable borders, 

- a minimize button, maximize button, system menu, 

- title bar, 

- no menu.




The MDI child windows are necessarily opened in the parent window. The display position of an MDI child window is always relative to its parent window.

**Remark**: No clipped skin template can be used on the MDI windows.

**Programming**
The MDI child windows must be opened by [MDIOpen](../WDLang1/3052005.md).

**Remark**: the test of a MDI child window cannot be directly run from the editor. Indeed, it must necessarily be opened from the parent window.

**Displaying messages or progress bars with ProgressBar and Message.**

- If the MDI child window includes a status bar, the message or the progress bar is displayed in the MDI child window.

- If the MDI child window includes no status bar, the message or the progress bar is displayed in the bar of the MDI parent window.

## Non-MDI window (or free window)
<a name="nonmdi_window_free_window_ELTTEXTE000215"></a>
For the non-MDI windows, no constraint about the size or the window type is linked to the opening mode of a window. Therefore, regardless of their opening mode, the windows can include:

- a title bar or not, 

- a minimize button or not, 

- a maximize button or not, 

- a button for the system menu or not, 

- a simple, thick or double window border, 

- a menu or not, 

- all types of controls.




The free windows can be opened:

- by [Open](../WDLang1/3038035.md) (modal opening).

- by [OpenChild](../WDLang1/3038021.md) or [OpenSister](../WDLang1/3038045.md) (non-modal opening).




**Remark**: windows can have rounded corners in Windows 11. The system applies this effect to windows with double or thick frames, and without clipping. Windows with a simple border cannot have rounded corners.
