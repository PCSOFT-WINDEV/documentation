## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000125"></a>
A Spreadsheet control found in a report can be handled through programming. 

- If the Spreadsheet control is linked to no data, it can be initialized through programming. 

- Several properties can be used to manage a Spreadsheet control in a report. 

- The "Before printing cell" process is used to modify the cells of the Spreadsheet control. 




Remarks: 

- No cell can be created during the print. The print must be performed from the Spreadsheet control found in a window or from an Excel document. 

- The height and width of the cells, rows or columns cannot be modified.

## Initializing a Spreadsheet control in a report
<a name="initializing_spreadsheet_control_report_ELTTEXTE000149"></a>
To initialize a Spreadsheet control found in a report through programming, all you have to do is assign the Excel file to the control (in the opening process of the report or in the initialization process of the control for example). 


```txt
<Name_Spreadsheet_control> = <File name>
```


For example: 


```wl
PSHEET_Statistics = "Show2015.xlsx"
```

## Properties specific to the management of Spreadsheet control in a report
<a name="properties_specific_the_management_spreadsheet_control_report_ELTTEXTE000173"></a>
The following properties are used to manage the Spreadsheet controls in the reports: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [AdjustmentMode](../Proprietes/1000021790.md) | The **AdjustmentMode** property determines and changes how a Spreadsheet control is adjusted in a report. |
| [GridlinesVisible](../Proprietes/1000023117.md) | The **GridlinesVisible** property is used to: <br><br>- Determine whether or not gridlines are visible in a control. <br><br>- Show or hide gridlines in a control.<br><br><br> |
| [PrintArea](../Proprietes/1000021809.md) | The **PrintArea** property is used to get and change the print area of a Spreadsheet control in a report. |
| [PrintedSheet](../Proprietes/1000021814.md) | Within a report, the **PrintedSheet** property is used to get and change the sheet of a Spreadsheet control to be printed. |

## "Before printing cell" process
<a name="before_printing_cell_process_ELTTEXTE000230"></a>
The "Before printing cell" process is a process associated with the Spreadsheet control in the reports. 

This process is used to customize the characteristics of the cells found in the Spreadsheet control. 

You can use: 

- the **MySelf** keyword to get the name of the current cell. 

- the **MySelf[MySelf]** syntax to get the content of the cell. 




Tip: **MySelf[MySelf]** corresponds to an [xlsCell](../WDLang5/1000017472.md) variable. All the properties of this variable type can be used and they allow you to modify the characteristics of the cell. 

Example: 


```wl
MyFont is Font
MyFont.Name = "Comic Sans MS"
MyFont.Size = 10
MyFont.Bold = True
MyFont.Underline = True
MyFont.Color = PastelBlue

ABorder is Border
ABorder.Line = LineDotAndDash
ABorder.Thickness = 1
ABorder.Edges = BorderAll

IF MySelf [= "B" THEN
	MySelf[MySelf].BackgroundColor = PastelOrange
	IF Right(MySelf[MySelf],1) = 8 THEN
		MySelf[MySelf].Font = MyFont 
	END
	IF Right(MySelf[MySelf],1) = 6 THEN
		MySelf[MySelf].Border = ABorder
	END
	IF Right(MySelf[MySelf],1) = 2 THEN
		MySelf[MySelf].Value = "RESET"
		MySelf[MySelf].Font.Color = Black
		MySelf[MySelf].Font.Size = 13
	END
END
```
