## Overview of the "Internal window" control

### Window control
<a name="window_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000011"></a>

The "Internal Window" control is used to include a window (and its code) in a control found in another window.

At runtime, the Internal window will be dynamically merged with the host window.

The "Internal Window" control is used to dynamically share the same interface section between one or more applications. The window to merge (internal window) can also come from a component.

**Caution: Do not confuse "Internal Window control" and "Internal window": the "Internal window" control is a type of control while the "Internal window" is a type of window.**

To create an internal window:

 in the quick access buttons.

3. Click the "Internal window" tab and select "Blank" (select the associated skin template if necessary). Validate to create the window.




An internal window corresponds to a specific type of window. The internal window contains no border, no title bar, no status bar and no background image. It is intended to be displayed in an "Internal window" control.

This type of window is also called "Source window".

**Remarks**:

- In the "UI" tab of the description window, you have the ability to specify whether the source window must use the skin template of the target window. To do so, simply check the option "Applies the skin template of project of the host window".

- A blank internal window can also be created as follows:

	- Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_nouveau.gif)
 in the quick access buttons. 

	- The creation window appears: click "Window" then "Internal window".

	- The internal window is automatically created in the editor.




- If the internal window is used on different platforms, in portrait or landscape mode, you have the ability to define layouts. For more details, see [Managing layouts](../Editeurs/9000153.md).

If the internal window is included in a component, the skin template of the host project can be applied to the internal window ("Apply the skin template of the host project (component only)" from the "UI" tab in the description window of the internal window). 

This option is ignored if the internal window is not included in a component.
