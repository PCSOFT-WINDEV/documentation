## Overview of the Cell control

### Control in a dynamic or static page
<a name="control_dynamic_static_page_ELTPARAGRAPHE000011"></a>

The Cell control contains controls.

The Cell control is used to:

- define a color area. Controls can be positioned on this area.
	The color (or the background image) of the cell can be selected in the "Style" tab of the description window of control.

- move up the controls found below a Drawer control when it is collapsed. 

- communicate with the user.
	Remark: it is recommended to use a [Popup control](../WDChamp/1000022001.md) to communicate with the user.

- define an HTML table in a static page, etc.




**Remark**: The controls are associated with a cell. The option "The control can be overlaid" must not be checked for the controls associated with the Cell control. Indeed, if this option is checked, the control will not be associated with the cell.

## Creating a Cell control
<a name="creating_cell_control_ELTTEXTE000205"></a>
To create a Cell control: 

1. On the "Creation" tab, in the "Containers" group, click "Cell".

2. Click where you want to create the control in the page. The control appears in the editor.




To view the characteristics of the control, select "Description" in the context menu.



## Cell with relative positioning
<a name="cell_with_relative_positioning_ELTTEXTE000229"></a>
The Cell control can be used in "relative positioning" mode.

In this mode, the controls located inside the cell are dynamically positioned from left to right and from top to bottom according to their size. This mode is used to eliminate the empty space left by an invisible control.

**To define a cell in "relative positioning" mode**:

1. Display the description window of the cell.

2. In the "General" tab, specify the positioning of controls: 

	- Free (by default). 

	- Relative, from right to left. 

	- Relative, from left to right.




3. Type the size of inside margin of cell (in pixels) in the "Style" tab ("Margins" element).

4. Validate




**Remark**: In a cell with relative positioning, the rules of resizable areas continue to apply.
