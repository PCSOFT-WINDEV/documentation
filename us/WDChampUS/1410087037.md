## Default events
<a name="default_events_ELTTEXTE000136"></a>
WINDEV manages the following events by default (in order of appearance in the code editor):

| Initializing | Executed when the window is opened. \* |
| --- | --- |
| After loading a document | Run after loading a document in the PDF Reader control. This event is not run when the control is managed via the PDF Reader control functions (for example, when opening a document with [PDFReaderOpen](../WDLang1/1000023452.md)). |
| Before closing a document | Run before closing the document in the PDF Reader control. This event is not run when the control is managed via the PDF Reader control functions (for example, when opening a new document with [PDFReaderOpen](../WDLang1/1000023452.md)). |
| Refreshing the ribbon | Run when the ribbon must be refreshed (to display the number of pages found in the PDF document for example). <br><br> |
| Event | Runtime condition |


(\*) By default, the "Initialization" event of each control is executed according to the order in which the controls were created in the window. To change this order of execution: 

1. On the "Window" tab, in the "Order" group, click "Initialization".

2. In the window that appears, use the arrows on the right to change the order in which the controls are initialized.

Several optional events are supported.
To add an optional event:

2. Display the code window of this control (F2 key).

3. Click the link "Add other events to xxx" at the bottom of the window code, after the last event.  ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Traitements_optionnels_WD_OK%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)


4. All the optional events available for the control are displayed. 

5. Check the optional event to add and validate. 
	Remark: You can select several optional events. 

6. The selected optional event is automatically added to the events managed by the control.




To disable an optional event, simply perform the same operations to display the list of optional events. Then simply uncheck the optional events to delete. 
Remark: If the disabled code contains WLanguage code, this code is automatically deleted.You can manage the following aspects, for example:

- the mouse hover over the control,

- left mouse button down, up, double click,

- right mouse button down, up, double click, 

- mouse wheel, etc.
