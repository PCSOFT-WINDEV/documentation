An OLE control can be bound to an item in a data file, query, etc. "Sound, image and binary" items can be bound to OLE controls. The stored information corresponds to the file name.

<a name="NOTE2"></a>

<a name="updating_the_item_with_the_data_from_the_ole_control_ELTTEXTE000089"></a>
**1st case: the controls in the window are bound to items in a data file**
All the items in the data file (or a related file) that are bound to a control in the window will be updated by [ScreenToFile](../WDLang4/3044146.md).

**2nd case: the controls in the window are not bound to items in a data file**
The value of each control must be assigned to each item using the following syntax:


```txt
<Data file>.<Item> = <Control name>
```
