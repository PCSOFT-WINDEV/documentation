## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000183"></a>
You have the ability to create Organizer controls linked to data. You can create:

- an **Organizer control based on a data file**: the Organizer control will be linked to a data file or to a query. In this case, the data file contains the characteristics of the appointments. 

- an **Organizer control based on a variable**: the Organizer control will be linked to a variable (a class instance in most cases). In this case, the class lists the appointments with their characteristics. 




This makes programming Organizer controls easier: there is no need to use the [Organizerxxx functions](../WDLang1/1000019021.md) directly.

### Creating an Organizer control based on a data file
<a name="creating_organizer_control_based_data_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000034"></a>

To create an Organizer control based on a data file, you can: 

- use the wizard for creating the Organizer control. To do so, select "Display data from a file or existing query". Answer the questions asked by the wizard and validate. 

- modify the description of the Organizer control. 




To modify the characteristics of an existing Organizer control:

1. Open the control description window (select "Description" in the context menu). 

2. In the "Content" tab, select "File" and select the data source used. This data source can be: 

	- a data file defined in the analysis, 

	- a query of the project, 

	- a query included in the window or in the page. 




3. Associate the different items of the data source with the characteristics of the appointment. The elements preceded by a star are mandatory. 
	**Remark**: If the associated data file does not directly contain the corresponding item, you can set a multi-file link. 

4. Validate the description window of the Organizer control. The Organizer control is now based on a data file. 





### Creating an Organizer control based on a variable

To create an Organizer control based on a variable, you can: 

- use the wizard for creating the Organizer control. To do so, select "Display data from an existing variable". Answer the questions asked by the wizard and validate. 

- modify the description of the Organizer control. 




To modify the characteristics of an existing Organizer control: 

1. Open the control description window (select "Description" in the context menu). 

2. In the "Content" tab, select "By variable" and select the data source used (class, ...). 

3. Associate the different elements (members of the class for example) of the data source with the characteristics of the appointment. The elements preceded by a star are mandatory. 

4. Validate the description window of the Organizer control. The Organizer control is now based on a variable. 






## Handling an Organizer control based on a data file or variable

### Organizer control based on a data file

Organizer controls based on a data file are very easy to handle: 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) If the user is using the Organizer control via the context menu of the control, the additions, deletions and modifications made to the appointments will be automatically applied to the data source linked to the control. 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) If the user handles the appointments via a specific window, all you have to do is modify the data file linked to the Organizer control. The displayed data will be automatically refreshed. It is also possible to use [OrganizerDisplay](../WDLang1/1000019425.md) to refresh the data in the control. 

- If the Organizer control allows the modification of the duration and/or the move of appointments, the modifications made to the appointment will be automatically applied to the data file linked to the control. 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) The deletion performed in the control is performed at the same time in the linked data source.
