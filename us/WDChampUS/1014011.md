WINDEV, WINDEV Mobile and WEBDEV allow you to create custom interfaces with the window editor and the page editor.

The window editor and the page editor enable you to:

- create the windows and the pages of your application.

- create controls in your windows and pages. These controls will allow the users to display and enter the application data. For all types of controls, several characteristics can be configured in the editor or through programming. 




Furthermore, WINDEV, WINDEV Mobile and WEBDEV allow you easily create reports that group all the required information. The report editor proposes different types of reports and different types of controls for creating your prints.
