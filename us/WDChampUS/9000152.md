## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000199"></a>
The sliding windows (also called sliding menus) are often used in the mobile applications. 

The characteristics for using this type of window are as follows: 

- The sliding window can appear from the left or from the right of screen. 

- The sliding window can be partially displayed above the previous window or it can partially shift this window. 




A typical use for this type of window is the display of a list of choices or the configuration of an application. 

WINDEV Mobile allows you to display this type of window: 

- via user gesture, 

- through programming, with [WinSlidingVisible](../WDLang1/1000020978.md). 




Caution: Sliding windows can only be used with maximized windows.

## How to propose sliding windows?
<a name="how_propose_sliding_windows_ELTTEXTE000223"></a>
The different steps to propose sliding windows are as follows: 

1. [Creating internal windows](#NOTE2_2). These internal windows will be the sliding windows. 

2. [Defining the sliding windows that will be displayed in the description window of the main window](#NOTE2_3). 

3. Defining the display mode of sliding windows: 

	- by gesture. 

	- through programming.

### Creating internal windows
<a name="creating_internal_windows_ELTPARAGRAPHE000053"></a>

The sliding windows are internal windows.  

This internal window has the following characteristics: 

- [Close](../WDLang1/3038018.md) used in the sliding window or in the main window will close both windows. 

- The controls of the sliding window are accessible via the main window, with the following keywords: 

	- [MyLeftSlidingWindow](../Motscles/1511022.md) to identify the left sliding window. 

	- [MyRightSlidingWindow](../Motscles/1511023.md) to identify the right sliding window. 
			
		```wl
		// Changes the caption color in the right sliding window
		MyRightSlidingWindow.STC_Caption.Color = LightRed
		```





- Aspect of sliding window: 
	The color and the border of the sliding window are defined by the internal window. If the internal window has a transparent background, the background color of the sliding window will be the background color of the main window.

### Defining the sliding windows associated with a window
<a name="defining_the_sliding_windows_associated_with_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000083"></a>

To define the sliding windows associated with a window: 

1. Open the "Details" tab in the description window of main window. 

2. Select the internal windows that will be displayed as sliding windows: 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=FenCoulissante_Description.gif)


	- In the "Left sliding window" (or "Right sliding window") area, specify: 

	- **the internal window to display**. The different internal windows of the application are proposed when expanding the list. 

	- **the width of internal window**. 
						The width of sliding window can correspond to: 

		- the width of internal window. In this case, leave the "Width" control empty. 

		- a percentage of the main window. In this case, the anchors defined in the internal window will be applied. No horizontal scrollbar will be displayed. 
										Remarks: 
										- The height is fixed by the height of the internal window. A vertical scrollbar will be displayed if the height exceeds the height of the screen. 
										- You have the ability to use [WinUsefulSize](../WDLang1/1000017089.md) to define the useful size of the sliding window.
