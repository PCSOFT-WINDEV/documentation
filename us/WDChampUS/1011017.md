## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000106"></a>
The result of a PCL print mainly depends on the technical features of the printer used (management of images and lines, management of fonts, ...).

WINDEV and WEBDEV start the print job based on the selected printer.

If the selected printer is:

- [one of the printers supported by WINDEV or WEBDEV](../WDChamp/1011022.md), the generated PCL file makes the most out of the printer's features (colors, text color, images, borders, fonts, etc.).

- **the "Generic" printer ("Universal PCL")**, the generated PCL file will use the default characteristics of the PCL printers. The borders, the lines and the images will be printed only if the printer supports them.

- **the "Universal PCL No Font" printer**: this driver enables you to print on any printer even if the printer fonts are not available. The fonts from the mobile device are used. Printing on this driver allows you not to use the printer fonts. All the font sizes are supported. However, using this driver slows down the print. 
	**Remark**: you can copy additional font files (.ttf files) to the "\\Windows\\Fonts" directory of the PC used.

## General characteristics
<a name="general_characteristics_ELTTEXTE000130"></a>
The prints performed on a PCL printer have the following characteristics:

- Printing in Portrait mode

- Printing in A4 format

- Print quality: Medium

- Resolution: 300 dpi.

- Print speed: the speed depends on the content of the report. The larger the number of lines and images is, the slower printing will be.

- Management of fonts:
	**When printing on a generic printer**, the fonts used are the printer fonts. The printer automatically selects the font that best suits the specified criteria. The maximum size of the font depends on the characteristics of the printer used. See the documentation about the printer used.
	**When printing on the "Universal PCL No Font" printer**, you have the ability to print on any printer even if the printer fonts are not available. The fonts from the mobile device are used. All the font sizes are supported. However, using this driver slows down the print.

- The RTF format is not taken into account.

- The captions printed sideways are ignored.

- When printing lines or borders, the printed lines are always solid lines. Printing rounding borders is not supported.

- Depending on the type of printer used, the characters that do not exist in the ISO 8859-1 Latin 1 character set (ECMA 94 Latin 1) - (for example: the Â€ character) may not be printed properly or may not be printed at all.

If you choose to print on a generic PCL printer, the print features are as follows (these features are in addition to the general features):

- Printing in Black and White

- Printing lines and borders may not be supported by the printer where the printing will be done.

- The images may not be printed by the printer on which the print will be performed.
