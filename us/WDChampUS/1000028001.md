## Overview of the Social Network control
<a name="overview_the_social_network_control_ELTTEXTE000196"></a>
The "Social network" control is a toolbar containing icons used to establish the link to the main social networks of the Web:

- Facebook,

- Tweeter,

- Linkedln,

- Tumblr,

- Pinterest.

- Instagram.

- TikTok.

- WhatsApp.




In most cases, this control is inserted into a site or on the side of an article. 

This control allows the Web user to perform two types of actions: 

- Share his experience with the community of his social network. 

- Evaluate a page or a site via the "I like" feature of Facebook or the "+1" feature of Google+. 




**Remark**: The Social Network control is not available for Ajax and browser loopers. The Social Network control is available for standard loopers only.

## Characteristics of the Social Network control
<a name="characteristics_the_social_network_control_ELTTEXTE000244"></a>
The "General" tab of the control description is used to define: 

- The **type** of link to display. One or more types of buttons can be displayed for each social network:

- The **target** of the action on the social network. This target can be: 

	- the domain. A click on the Social Network control will create a link to the actual domain of the current site. 

	- the site. A click on the Social Network control will create a link to the current site (which means the current address without the name of the page). 

	- the current page. A click on the Social Network control will create a link to the current page of the WEBDEV site. If the WEBDEV site is a dynamic site, the link will be performed toward the domain. 

	- a custom target. A click on the Social Network control will create a link to a site other than the current site. This site can be specified in the "URL or target account" control. 
			For more details, see [Available targets for each type of link](../WDChamp/1000028004.md).




- **Target URL**: URL address to use when the target is customized (for a "Tweeter" link for example).

- **Target account**: Address of the account to use when the target is customized (for a "Follow" link for example).
	For more details, see [Available targets for each type of link](../WDChamp/1000028004.md).




Depending on the type of link, you have the ability to: 

- **Use the native button recommended by the social network**. In this case, some options can be configured: 

	- **Show number of shares in a tooltip**: If this option is checked, the number of shares will be displayed in a tooltip beside the Social Network control.

	- **Ask the social network to be displayed in the current language of the page**: If this option is checked, the button characteristics will be displayed in the page language (for example, the caption of "Recommend" button will be automatically translated). 

- **Use a custom image link**. In this case, all you have to do is select the image to use. 
	**Caution**: You must comply with the use conditions of social networks, especially the restrictions regarding the images in the links that direct to their services. Use the official images supplied by the sites.
