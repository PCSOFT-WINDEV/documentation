### Generating a PDF file on the Web server
<a name="generating_pdf_file_the_web_server_ELTPARAGRAPHE000025"></a>

To generate a PDF file on the Web server:

1. Create a unique name for the PDF file to be generated. The creation directory of this file must be accessible in read/write (the directory of the data files or the "&lt;MyProject&gt;_WEB" directory of the site for example). 
	For details on how to create a unique file name, see [Defining a unique name for the generated file](../WDChamp/1011009.md).

2. Configure the print destination with [iDestination](../WDLang5/3046074.md) associated with the *iPDF* constant (print in a PDF file).

3. Specify the name of the report to print in [iPrintReport](../WDLang5/3046032.md). 
	The PDF file is created on the Web server.

### Displaying the PDF file
<a name="displaying_the_pdf_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000049"></a>

The display of the file can be:

- immediate.

- requested by the web user (click performed on a link for example).




**To automatically display the file generated in the browser of the Web user,** all you have to do is use [FileDisplay](../WDLang2/3012005.md).

**To display the generated file upon request,** you must:

- use the [FileDisplay](../WDLang2/3012005.md) function.

- modify the URL of the control that displays the PDF file ([URL](../Proprietes/2510132.md) property of a button or link for example).

### Deleting the PDF file
<a name="deleting_the_pdf_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000076"></a>

To reduce the disk space occupied by the reports in PDF format on the Web server, we advise you to delete the unused reports on a regular basis. You can delete the report once it has been displayed or you can create a procedure used to delete the reports created during the day for example.

<a name="NOTE3"></a>
<a name="NOTE3_1"></a>


## Example
<a name="example_ELTTEXTE000209"></a>
The "RPT_InvoicePDF" report is displayed in PDF format on the computer of the Web  user.

The "ShowInvoice" button is used to:

- generate the PDF file in the "&lt;MyProject&gt;_WEB" directory of the site.

- show the report in PDF format.

- delete the report in PDF format once it has been viewed.




In this example, the server click code of the "ShowInvoice" button is as follows:


```wl
// Generate a unique PDF file name
AFile is string  
AFile = fWebDir() + "\" + DateSys() + TimeSys() + ".pdf" 
// Configure the destination of the print 
iDestination(iPDF, AFile) 
// Print the RPT_InvoicePDF report
iPrintReport(RPT_InvoicePDF) 
// Send the file to the browser 
FileDisplay(AFile, "application/pdf") 
// Delete the file 
fDelete(AFile)
```


**Remark**: The PDF file can be directly opened from a button or from a link. Simply change the control action with the [URL](../Proprietes/2510132.md) property:


```wl
// Generate a unique PDF file name  
AFile is string  
AFile = fWebDir() + "\" + DateSys() + TimeSys() + ".pdf" 
// Configure the destination of the print 
iDestination(iPDF, AFile) 
// Print the RPT_InvoicePDF report
iPrintReport(RPT_InvoicePDF) 
// Retrieve the name of the PDF file 
FileName is string  
FileName = fExtractPath(AFile, fFile + fExtension) 
// Modify the action of the Link control that will open the PDF file 
LINK_PDFLink.URL = "/" + FolderWeb() + "/" + FileName
```
