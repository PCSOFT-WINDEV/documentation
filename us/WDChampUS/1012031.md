To optimize the style of your pages, WEBDEV allows you to use: 

- a background image in your pages. Your controls are displayed above this background image.

- an image in browser background.

<a name="background_image_pages_ELTTEXTE000200"></a>
To define the image that will be used in page background: 

1. Open the page description window: on the "Page" tab, in the "Description" group, click "Description" (or select "Description" in the context menu of the page).

2. In the "Style" tab, in the "Style" area, select the "Page border/background" element. 

3. To define the page background color, specify:

	- the color of the borders

	- the background color

	- the style of the borders and background. 




4. To define the page background image: 

	- Select the image that will be used as page background (via the ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Menu_Image_Editeur%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)
 button of the "Background image" control): 

		- The "Browse" option is used to select an image file accessible from your computer.

		- The "Catalog" option is used to select an image in the image catalog provided with WEBDEV.




- Specify the characteristics regarding the image repetition: 

	- None, 

	- Tiled image (in height and width), 

	- Tiled image X (in width), 

	- Tiled image Y (in height).

5. Validate.




**Remarks**: 

- The management mode of the image size is a feature available in CSS3. To use this feature, the page must be generated in HTML 5 mode. The generation mode of HTML pages can be defined: 

	- for the project ("Advanced" tab of project description, "Generation standard of HTML code" option). 

	- for the page ("General" tab of page description, "Generation standard of HTML code" option). 




- To define the same page background image for all the pages of your project, define this image for the page template used by your project. For more details, see [Page template](../WDChamp/1012015.md). 

- The background image is displayed by the browser. If the image file used is too big, the display of the page may be slowed down.
