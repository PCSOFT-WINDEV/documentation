## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000190"></a>
WEBDEV proposes several types of links according to the action of the link on the page controls.

<a name="NOTE2"></a>
<a name="NOTE2_1"></a>


## The different types
<a name="the_different_types_ELTTEXTE000214"></a>
The type of link is linked to the type of operation performed on the controls. The choice of the operation is performed in the description window of the link ("General" tab).

The available types of operation are as follows:

- **Send field values to the server (submit)**: 
	The link validates all the controls found in the current page and returns the value of the controls to the server. Then, the server performs the specified action.

- **Reset page fields (reset):**
	The link clears all the page controls (except for the controls initialized by programming).

- **None**: 
	The link performs the requested action but it does not return the content of the controls found in the current page to the server.

### Remark: Internet browsers only allow a single action on the page per process
<a name="remark_internet_browsers_only_allow_single_action_the_page_per_process_ELTPARAGRAPHE000037"></a>

Some types of links automatically trigger an action on the page (link performing the "Send the value of controls to the server" operation, link performing the "None" operation whose action differs from "none").

This function will be ignored if [PageSubmit](../WDLang2/3058020.md) or [EmailOpenMail](../WDLang2/3032021.md) are used in the browser click process of these links (or in a procedure called by this process): only the action of the link will be performed.

**Consequences**: [PageSubmit](../WDLang2/3058020.md) or [EmailOpenMail](../WDLang2/3032021.md) cannot be used in a code that triggers an action (automatically or not). These functions are ignored:

- in the click code of a link that performs the "Send to server" operation

- in the click code of a link that performs the "other" operation whose action differs from "None"

- if [PageSubmit](../WDLang2/3058020.md) is followed by [EmailOpenMail](../WDLang2/3032021.md) (in the current process, in a procedure called by the current process or in another process called by [Execute](../WDLang1/3013041.md)).

- if [EmailOpenMail](../WDLang2/3032021.md) is followed by [PageSubmit](../WDLang2/3058020.md) (in the current process, in a procedure called by the current process or in another process called by [Execute](../WDLang1/3013041.md)).




To use [PageSubmit](../WDLang2/3058020.md) or [EmailOpenMail](../WDLang2/3032021.md) from a link (browser click code of button), this link must have the following characteristics ("General" tab of description window):

- Operation on the controls: "None"

- Action: "None"

## Choosing a type of link
<a name="choosing_type_link_ELTTEXTE000244"></a>
Let's see some "standard" examples for using links in a page:

| Action to perform | Example | Operation on the controls |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Send data of the current page to the server to be processed | Registration form.<br><br>The link is used to check the validity of the information entered and it displays a confirmation page. | Send value of controls to server (submit) |
| Perform processing on the server, without retrieving data from the current page | Menu page with buttons.<br><br>Each link is used to display a page of the site | None |
| Perform processing in browser code | Perform a simple calculation, an input check, ... | None |
| Display a static page of the site | Display the home page of the site | None |
| Display a page external to the site | Start a search engine | None |
| Reset page fields | Clear the controls of the current page | Reinitialize page controls (reset) |
