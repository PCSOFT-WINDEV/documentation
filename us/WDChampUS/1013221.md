## Overview of OLE control
<a name="overview_ole_control_ELTTEXTE000112"></a>
The OLE control allows you to handle an OLE object.

**Reminder**: OLE is a protocol for exchanging data and commands whose principle consists in embedding and linking objects. The Client/Server connection is established as soon as the embedded object is opened.

An **OLE object** is a file containing:

- the reference of the OLE server that created the object

- the object itself (image, document...).




Technically speaking, an OLE object encapsulates data containing text, images, sounds... Data encapsulation in OLE objects enables these objects to be exported without knowing anything about their structure.

**To create an OLE control**: 

1. On the "Creation" tab, in the "Other controls" group, click "OLE".

2. Click at the desired location to create the control.




To view the characteristics of the control, select "Description" in the context menu.

## WINDEV and OLE controls
<a name="windev_and_ole_controls_ELTTEXTE000136"></a>
WINDEV is an OLE client. The applications developed in WINDEV request the data, display and store the OLE objects.

The OLE servers provide the objects to the clients that request them. These objects can be PaintBrush, Excel, WinWord...

As a client, WINDEV supports the OLE objects. It is used to:

- draw an object in an OLE control. An object can be an Excel worksheet, a Paint Brush graphic image...

- edit an OLE object in an OLE control. The OLE object can be:

	- chosen in the editor or by programming.

	- defined according to a server or to a base file.







Remarks:

- In programming, an OLE control is handled by specific functions. WINDEV is not an OLE server.

- OLE version 1 and OLE version 2 are supported (the later versions are not supported).

- An OLE object cannot be printed in WINDEV. The object is updated upon request.

- An OLE control can contain a single OLE object.
