## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000113"></a>
Several properties can be used with the breaks headers and footers found in a Table control. These properties can be used in a window or in a page. 

To use these properties, the syntax is as follows: 


```txt
<Name of Table control>.<Name of Break Header/Footer>..<Property name> = <Value>
```


or 


```txt
<Name of break header/footer>..<Property name> = <Value>
```


**Remark**: These lines of code must be in the "Displaying a row of break header/footer" event.

### Functions associated with break headers and footers
<a name="functions_associated_with_break_headers_and_footers_ELTPARAGRAPHE000027"></a>The following functions are associated with the break headers and footers:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [TableBreakIndex](../WDLang1/1000018758.md) | Returns the index of the break header and footer for a given break in a Table control. |
| [TableCollapse](../WDLang1/1000010008.md) | Collapses:<br><br>- a branch that was previously expanded in a TreeView Table control. <br><br>- a break that was previously expanded in a Table control. <br><br>- a detailed window displayed for a row.<br><br><br> |
| [TableCollapseAll](../WDLang1/1000010003.md) | Collapses:<br><br>- the entire hierarchy (all nodes) of a TreeView Table control.<br><br>- all breaks of a Table control. <br><br><br> |
| [TableExpand](../WDLang1/1000010007.md) | Expands:<br><br>- a branch that was previously collapsed in a TreeView Table control. <br><br>- a branch that was previously collapsed in a Table control. <br><br>- a detailed window displayed for a row.<br><br><br> |
| [TableExpandAll](../WDLang1/1000010001.md) | Expands:<br><br>- the entire hierarchy (all nodes) of a TreeView Table control.<br><br>- all breaks of a Table control. <br><br><br> |





![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Several WLanguage functions can be used to create breaks through programming: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [BreakAdd](../WDLang1/1000022737.md) | Adds a break into a Table or Looper control. |
| [BreakDelete](../WDLang1/1000022738.md) | Deletes a break from a Table control or from a Looper control. |
