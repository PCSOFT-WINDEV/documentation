## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000143"></a>
WDAPI simplifies the use of Windows APIs in a WINDEV application. WDAPI generates the WLanguage code and structures required for using a given Windows API.

**Caution**: WDAPI cannot be used to find an API according to a given feature. To use WDAPI, you must know the name of the API to use. 
WDAPI does NOT document the use of each Windows API of the system! However, WDAPI gives you the ability to directly start a site or a document (chosen by yourself) corresponding to the documentation of the Windows APIs.

WDAPI will not train you on how to use the 1,600 Windows APIs but it will help you tremendously in the generation step of the code. In fact, the API function that was selected in WDAPI can be used in your code.

**Remark**: The list of Windows APIs supplied with WDAPI is NOT exhaustive.
