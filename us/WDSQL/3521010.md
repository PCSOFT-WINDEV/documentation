## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000165"></a>
The first operation to perform in order to use WDSQL is to establish the connection to a database. Once this connection is established, you have the ability to create and run SQL queries on the database used.

Several types of connections are available:

- Direct connection to a HFSQL Classic database.

- Connection to a database via an OLE DB provider.

- Connection to a database via an ODBC driver.

- Connection to a database via a native access.




**Remark**: WDSQL is used to store the parameters of several connections. See "Custom connection" for more details.

### Establishing a connection with a database
<a name="establishing_connection_with_database_ELTPARAGRAPHE000029"></a>

To establish a connection with a database:

1. Start WDSQL: a wizard is used to define the connection parameters. 
	If WDSQL is already started, select "File .. Connection" (or click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WDSQL%20-%20HC%20N%B0001%201.gif)
). The current connection is automatically closed. 
	**Remark**: The parameters of the last connection are automatically proposed.

2. Select the access mode to the database ("Connection by" option).
	**Remark**: WDSQL is used to:

	- Define the parameters of a connection. The connection can be established via:

		- an OLE DB provider,

		- an ODBC driver,

		- a native access (AS/400, Oracle, SQL Server, ...).




- Use a stored connection (called "Custom connection"). For more details, see [Custom connection](#NOTE3_1).

3. Specify the data source of connection. 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WDSQL%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif&type=thumb)
This data source can correspond to:

	- the name and full path of the database. 
			For example:

		- for HFSQL: "C:\\MyDirectory\\HFDatabase.WDD"

		- for Access: "C:\\MyDirectory\\AccessDatabase.MDB"




- the server name or alias.
			For example, for Oracle: "Oracle_Server"

- The directory containing the xBase file (".DBF").
			For example: "C:\\MyxBaseDirectory"

4. Type (if necessary) the username that will be used to connect to the database. 
	**Remark**: This name was defined when creating the database. Several users with different rights can exist for the same database.

5. Type the password if necessary. This password corresponds to:

	- The runtime password of the WINDEV analysis (for an HFSQL database). This password was defined in the description of the analysis.

	- The password used to connect to the database (for an Oracle or SQL Server database). This password was defined when creating the database.
			**Remark**: To automatically propose this password when the connection wizard is next started, check "Store the connection password".




6. Go to the next step. The list of the different files (or tables) found in the database is displayed.
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WDSQL%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.gif&type=thumb)


7. Select the files (or tables) to use with SQL in WDSQL. Specify the file password and path for each selected file. 
	**Remark**: If the same password was used for all selected files, type this password for the first selected file and check "The password is identical for all files".

8. Go to the next step. 
	**Remark**: If some selected files come from a WINDEV 5.5 analysis, specify the directory of this analysis.

9. The connection is established. Specify the operation to perform:

	- [Creating a new SQL query](../WDSQL/3521008.md).

	- Editing an SQL query already created by WDSQL.

	- Starting WDSQL.







**Remark**: If the connection parameters are incorrect, the connection is not established and the connection wizard is automatically started.

## Custom connection
<a name="custom_connection_ELTTEXTE000219"></a>
WDSQL is used to store the parameters of 20 connections. These connections are called "Custom connections".

To store the parameters of a custom connection:

1. Click the [...] button found on the right of "Connection by" list. The window for custom connections is displayed.

2. Type the connection name ("Connection name" combo box).

3. Specify the connection parameters and validate. These parameters are presented in the previous paragraph (operations 2 to 5).




To use the parameters of a custom connection:

1. Click the [...] button found on the right of "Connection by" list. The window for custom connections is displayed.

2. Select the name of the connection ("Connection name" combo box) and validate.
