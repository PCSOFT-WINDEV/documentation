## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000129"></a>
To implement an assisted replication, the first step consists in creating the replication with ReplicEdit. 

The replication is created via a wizard. 

The parameters defined in this wizard can be modified in the [replication description](../ReplicEdit/3526502.md).

## Creating the replication
<a name="creating_the_replication_ELTTEXTE000153"></a>
To create a replication: 

1. Start ReplicEdit from WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile: on the "Tools" tab, in the "Database" group, expand "Replication" and select "ReplicEdit - Replication editor".

2. If the startup wizard starts, select "Create a new replication".

Otherwise, select "File .. New". The replication creation wizard starts.

3. In the replication creation wizard, specify the name and description of the replication. This name will be given to the replication file that will be created (.WER file)

Go to the next step. 

4. The description of the data files to synchronize must be loaded in ReplicEdit in order to create the replication.

The wizard offers 2 possibilities: 

	- **Use an analysis (WDD)**. To do so, select the path of the corresponding ".WDD" file and the associated password (if necessary). 
			**In this case, the analysis must contain an HFSQL Client/Server connection. This connection must be associated with the data files** 
			Indeed, ReplicEdit cannot be used to create a connection. You only have the ability to modify an existing connection. 

	- **Import from an HFSQL server**. This option allows using the description of an HFSQL Client/Server database installed on a server (this method must be used if the application is deployed, for example). **This solution is recommended if your files are described in HFSQL Client/Server in the analysis**. ReplicEdit will automatically assign the connection used to the data files to replicate.
			In this case, the wizard requests: 

		- the connection parameters: address, port, user and password. 

		- the database to replicate. 




5. The next step allows you to choose the replication direction.

The direction of replication can be:

	- Bidirectional: data is synchronized on the master database and on the subscriber database.

	- To subscriber only: data is synchronized from the master to the subscriber.

	- To master only: data is synchronized from the subscriber to the master.




6. The next step is used to choose the method for managing the modification conflicts.

Conflict management allows managing records that have been modified by both the master and the subscriber. Choose the rule to apply:  

	- Most recent has priority: only the last modified record is taken into account.

	- Master always has priority: the record found in the master database is taken into account.

	- Subscriber always has priority: the record found in the subscriber database is taken into account.
			Caution: to avoid any problem, the server and the subscriber computers must use the same time. 




7. At the end of the wizard, you can add a file to the replication or go to the editor directly.
