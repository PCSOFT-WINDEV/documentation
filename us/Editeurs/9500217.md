The home page of WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile allows you to manage the pinned projects when opening an existing project.

This allows you to pin your favorites projects and to access them in a click. The pinned projects are proposed at the top of the list that displays the last opened projects.

<a name="saving_the_list_pinned_projects_ELTPARAGRAPHE000073"></a>

The list of pinned projects is specific to each user. 

This list is saved in the Bookmark.prj file located in the C:\\Users\\&lt;user&gt;\\AppData\\Local\\PC SOFT\\&lt;WINDEV/WEBDEV/WINDEV Mobile&gt; directory. 

Therefore, the pinned projects are always proposed whenever a new version of the product is used.
