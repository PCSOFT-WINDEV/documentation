## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000111"></a>
You are interested by a window found in a non-WINDEV application?

You want to retrieve its interface?

Nothing's easier. WINDEV enables you to import a window opened in the current environment.

The window is imported into the current project. Each window element is automatically changed into a WINDEV element (static control, edit control, button, ...).

**Remark**: All the window elements are imported but you may have to modify the window in order to get the requested interface.

## How to?
<a name="how_ELTTEXTE000135"></a>
To import a window into a WINDEV project:

1. Open the WINDEV project into which the window must be imported.

2. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_nouveau.gif) in the quick access buttons. 

	- The creation window appears: click "Window" then "Window".

	- The window creation wizard starts.




3. Display the "Import" tab. The windows currently displayed on the current computer are automatically listed. These windows are identified by their title (displayed in the title bar). 
	Remark: The "Generate images for unrecognized controls." option makes the final interface more similar to the interface of the window to be imported.

4. Validate. The preview of the window to import is displayed.

5. Modify (if necessary) the type of control created when importing the window ("Details" button).

6. Validate. The window is automatically included in the current WINDEV project.
