## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000098"></a>
All WLanguage code is written in the code editor, which offers several events on a given control : Enter, Modification, Exit, Click, ...

A standard series of events is always proposed for each element: window, control, report, etc.

From version 24, it is possible to hide empty events associated with an element. 

This allows for a neat code editor, according to your programming habits. 

Example: unused events have been hidden. The presentation is much clearer.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Traitements_vides%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif&type=thumb)


Remark: There are also [optional events](../WDChamp/1014004.md) that you can enable, of course.

To hide empty events associated to an element in WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile:

2. On the "Display" tab, in the "Help for edit" group, check or uncheck "Show empty processes".<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Traitements_vides%20-%20HC%20N%B0002%201.gif&type=thumb)
