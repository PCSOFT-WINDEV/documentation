## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000112"></a>
The **operating mode** of an executable allows you to define whether the executable can be used by one or more users.

The main **library** of an application groups all the elements handled by this application (windows, reports, classes, set of procedures, queries, data files) and their dependencies (images used in the windows for example). For more details, see the help about the [libraries](../Editeurs/2030022.md).
**Remark**: To create the executable, use one of the following methods: 

- On the "Project" tab, in the "Generation" group, click "Generate". 

- Expand ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_generation_exe.gif) in the quick access buttons and select "Generate the 32-bit Windows executable (exe)" or "Generate the 64-bit Windows executable (exe)". 




The executable creation wizard allows you to define the operating mode of the executable and the modes for using the library.

## Executable operating mode
<a name="executable_operating_mode_ELTTEXTE000136"></a>
The executable can be:

- ***multi-instance***. A multi-instance program can be started several times from the same computer: several instances of the program will be opened at the same time.

- ***single-instance***. A single-instance program can be started once only from the same computer. If the user tries to start another instance of the program, the current instance will be automatically enabled.

## Modes for using the library
<a name="modes_for_using_the_library_ELTTEXTE000160"></a>
The use modes of the library are as follows:

- ***including the main library in the executable***. This option is used to create (or modify) the main library of the current application and to **include** this library in the executable program. 
	To update the main library, the executable program must be re-created.

- ***external use of the main library***. This option is used to create (or modify) the main library of the current application and to **associate** this library with the executable program. 
	To update the main library, this library must be re-created.

- ***use no library***. No library will be associated with or included in the executable program. This option is kept for backward compatibility. For more details, see [Creating an executable without library](../Editeurs/2030025.md).
