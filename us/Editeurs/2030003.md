## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000515"></a>
When creating a project, a directory specific to this project is automatically created. This directory corresponds to the main directory of the project. The different project elements are stored in the subdirectories of this main directory. Each of these subdirectories has a specific role.

For example, the directories of the "Accounting" project are as follows. This project contains all the possible subdirectories. Depending on the configuration of your project, some directories may not exist.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=RepertoireProjetWD.gif)
**Remark**: A backup of the project can be performed at any time: on the "Project" tab, in the "Other actions" group, expand "Backup/Restore" and select "Make a project backup". For more details, see [Save a project](../Editeurs/2030014.md).
