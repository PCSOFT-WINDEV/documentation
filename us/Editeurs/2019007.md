## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000133"></a>
Running the test from the WEBDEV administrator (WDAdmin) is used to test: 

- the features of the site.

- the specific Web features (use of cookies, ...).




**Remark**: The WEBDEV administrator can only be used to run the test of dynamic sites (or the test of the dynamic part of "static + dynamic" sites).

Running the test from the WEBDEV administrator is equivalent to starting the dynamic site from a remote computer.

Before deploying a dynamic WEBDEV site, we recommend that you run the test of this site at least once from the WEBDEV administrator.

This help page explains how to run the test of a project from the WEBDEV administrator. The test of a dynamic project can also be run from the WEBDEV editor. For more details, see:

- [Testing a dynamic project from the WEBDEV editor](../Editeurs/2019009.md),

- [Differences between testing a project from the editor and from the administrator](../Editeurs/2019008.md).

Several differences can be noticed between these two test methods.
