Queries can be based on items from another query. The source query must have already been executed.

This type of query is available:

- with [HExecuteQuery](../WDLang4/3044080.md) and [HExecuteSQLQuery](../WDLang4/3044084.md).

- in the query editor.




**Caution**: Do not confuse "Query based on query" and "Sub-query". For more details, see [Sub-query](../Editeurs/2034009.md).

**Limitation**: Queries based on a query are not available for external databases (via OLE DB, ODBC or Native Connector). The database cannot determine the source query from which the second query is created.
