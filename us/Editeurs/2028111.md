## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000141"></a>
Starting with version 24, you can update a Session or AWP site without disconnecting users.

The update of a WEBDEV Session or AWP site does not affect connected users. Connected users stay on the old version. They will only have access to the new version of the site next time they log in. 

This deployment mode allows session sites to be deployed with zero downtime.

CAUTION: this mode is **not recommended** for: 

- sites containing Active WEBDEV Pages without context.

- sites with static pages. 

- PHP sites. 


By using this deployment mode, URLs change each time a new update is deployed, which affects the SEO of these pages and prevents users from remembering them. 

Remark: This feature is only available for sites deployed with WEBDEV version 24 and later.

## How to?

### Principle
<a name="principle_ELTPARAGRAPHE000033"></a>

To avoid disconnecting users, the server maintains several versions of the site. 

By default, 4 previous versions are kept on the server. 




### How to?

To install a site without disconnecting users during the update: 

1. **Case of a first site deployment**: 

	- Deploy your site for the first time. 
			In the plan for the zero-downtime update, select the option "Deploy without disconnecting users". 
			Remark: The installation is similar to the standard mode (as the site has never been deployed, there are no connected users).

	- In future updates, the site will automatically install itself without having to worry about whether or not users are connected.




2. **Case of a site already deployed**: If the site was already installed with the "classic" method: 

	- During the first installation using the option "Deploy without disconnecting users", ALL users will be disconnected. 

	- During the following installations/deployments, users will not be disconnected. 


This new mode applies from the second installation.







### Important: Management of directories and data files
<a name="important_management_directories_and_data_files_ELTPARAGRAPHE000061"></a>

If you use an installation without disconnecting users during the update: 

- use [fDataDirUser](../WDLang1/3036071.md) to handle or access data files of the site. When writing, do not use [fWebDir](../WDLang1/3036052.md) or [fExeDir](../WDLang1/3036049.md) because the data will not be synchronized between the different site updates. Only [fDataDirUser](../WDLang1/3036071.md) guarantees the use of a single directory shared between the different versions of the site. 

- to handle the directory &lt;Project Name&gt;_WEB, use [fWebDir](../WDLang1/3036052.md) and/or [FolderWeb](../WDLang2/3012015.md). Do not use the directory name directly (&lt;Project Name&gt;_WEB should not appear in your code). 







### Limitations
<a name="limitations_ELTPARAGRAPHE000088"></a>

**Caution**: You cannot go back to a standard installation after a zero-downtime installation. If you want to reinstall your site using the "classic" method, you must: 

1. Uninstall the site.

2. Delete from the web server (IIS or Apache) the virtual directories that have been created for this site.

3. Reinstall the site in classic mode.
