## Overview

### Principle for generating a Linux application with WINDEV
<a name="principle_for_generating_linux_application_with_windev_ELTPARAGRAPHE000011"></a>

WINDEV allows you to easily generate a Linux application. The method for developing the application is identical to the method for developing any other WINDEV application.

When the WINDEV project is compiled, the windows and the WLanguage functions are automatically converted into Linux.

**Remarks**: 

- Starting with version 27, the following Linux distributions are supported:

	- Debian 9 or later

	- Fedora 25 or later

	- Ubuntu 18.04 or higher (minimum GCC version: 5.1)




Starting with version 27, the following Linux distributions are no longer supported: 

- OpenSUSE:Leap:15.0. (The official version is openSUSE Leap 15.2, which is supported).

- The Linux applications developed with WINDEV operate on the devices equipped with an Intel processor or with a processor compatible with Intel (the ARM processors are not supported).

- Starting with version 28, you can only create **64-bit** Linux projects and executables.

### The following features are available in Linux
<a name="the_following_features_are_available_linux_ELTPARAGRAPHE000024"></a>

Several functions are available for WINDEV applications in Linux. We cannot give an exhaustive list as this list evolves with each version. 

It is recommended to check the documentation for each function. The ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=menu_btn_linux_1.gif) logo indicates whether the function is available in Linux as well as its limitations.

## Image formats
<a name="image_formats_ELTTEXTE000259"></a>
The following image formats are supported by the WINDEV Linux applications: 

- Bitmap (\*.BMP)

- Graphics Interchange Format (\*.gif)

- Joint Picture Experts Group (\*.jpg ; \*.jpeg)

- Portable Network Graphics (\*.png)

- Portable Bitmap (\*.pbm)

- Portable Graymap (\*.pgm)

- Portable Pixmap (\*.ppm)

- Tagged Image File Format (\*.tiff). 
	Remark: the "tiled tiff" option of tiff 6.0 standard is not supported. In this case, we advise you to save the image in tiff 5.0 standard. 

- X11 Bitmap (\*.xbm)

- X11 Pixmap (\*.xpm)

- Scalable Vector Graphics (\*.svg)
	Remark: To manage this format, you must install a QT library that supports the SVG format.

## Notes and limitations

### Using a Linux executable
<a name="using_linux_executable_ELTPARAGRAPHE000058"></a>

To use a Linux executable, the QT library (Core and GUI) version 5 (or later) must be installed. 

**In Ubuntu and Debian**, this library can be installed with the following commands: 


```txt
sudo apt-get install libqtcore5
sudo apt-get install libqtgui5
```
**In Ubuntu 20**, this library can be installed with the following commands: 


```txt
sudo apt-get install qt5-default
```
**In mandriva 2010 Spring**, this library can be installed with the following commands: 


```txt
urpmi libqtgui5
```


Remark: To benefit from the management of SVG images, the QT library installed must support the SVG format.


### Limitations
