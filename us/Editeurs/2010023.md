## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000177"></a>
Links help users navigate the help system. A link can be established:

- on a word or on a group of words.

- on an image.




For example: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=PageAide_Lien.gif)


WINDEV allows you to create a link to:

- a help page of the current help system.

- an anchor in a help page of the current help system.

- a help page of another help system in the project.

- a web page.




The characteristics of the links are specified in the [Link properties](../Editeurs/2010022.md).

### Properties of a text link
<a name="properties_text_link_ELTPARAGRAPHE000070"></a>

Once created, the link is used to display the help page specified in the current help window: the new help page replaces the help page currently displayed.

These characteristics can be changed via [the link properties](../Editeurs/2010022.md). For example, the help page can be displayed as a "popup window".

To open the link properties:

1. Position the mouse cursor on the text of the link.

2. Double-click the link text or select "Link properties" in the context menu.

### Creating an image link
<a name="creating_image_link_ELTPARAGRAPHE000087"></a>

Images inserted into a help page can contain one or more links to other pages. These images then become **clickable images**. These links can be created when the image is inserted into the help page or later via the properties of an image.

For more details, see [Inserting an image into a help page](../Editeurs/2010026.md).
