In the code editor: 

- The modified lines of code are immediately visible (1).

- The event in which the cursor is positioned can be easily spotted (2).

(1): **The modified lines of code**
Only the code modifications performed since the opening of the current element are taken into account:

- the lines of code preceded by a blue bar have been saved.

- the lines of code preceded by an orange bar have not been saved yet.




When the element is closed, the colored bars disappear automatically.

(2): **Current event**
The vertical bar on the left of the code changes color to easily identify the WLanguage event where the cursor is positioned. Useful in a large code page.
