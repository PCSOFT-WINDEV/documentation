## Overview

The selection of records performed by query is not necessarily displayed in a report, in a window, ... This selection can also be used in programming.

Most of the HFSQL functions (browse, search, read, ...) can be used both on data files and on the query result. To use these functions on a query, you need to execute the query first (with [HExecuteQuery](../WDLang4/3044080.md)).

For example, the *Customer34* query selects all the customers whose zip code starts with 34. The *PrintCustomer* procedure is used to print a proforma invoice for each customer. The following code is used to browse the result of the *Customer34* query and to print an invoice for all the selected customers.


```wl
// Run the query
ResExecute = HExecuteQuery(Customer34)
// Error while running the query?
IF ResExecute = True THEN
	// Browse the result of the query
	FOR EACH Customer34
	   	// Print the invoice for each record
		PrintCustomer(Customer34.CustomerLName, Customer34.CustomerFName, ...
				Customer34.CustomerAddress, Customer34.CustomerZipCode, ...
				Customer34.CustomerCity)
	END
ELSE
	 // Display the error message
	 Error("The query was not run.")
END
```

- **Analysis password**: If the query is associated with an analysis protected by password at runtime, this password must be specified when opening the analysis ([HOpenAnalysis](../WDLang4/3044106.md)) in the initialization process of the project.

- **File password**: If the query is based on one or more password-protected files, specify the passwords with [HPass](../WDLang4/3044108.md) before executing the query (with [HExecuteQuery](../WDLang4/3044080.md)).
