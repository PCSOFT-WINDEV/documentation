## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000173"></a>
The reverse code modeling allows you to view in a graph:

- the different processes, calls to procedures found in a WLanguage procedure or process. The final graph is called **"Graph of callees"**. 
	This type of graph allows you to understand how a procedure is organized and to find where modifications must be performed (when re-using an existing code for example).

- the different processes that call a WLanguage procedure or process. The final graph is called **"Graph of callers"**. 
	This type of graph allows you to evaluate the impact of a modification made in a procedure.




The reverse modeling can be performed on the code of a window, page, control, procedure, ...
The reverse modeling creates a graph in the modeling editor. This chart can be entirely modified according to your own requirements.

### Example: modeling of the callees for the "OrderValidation" procedure
<a name="example_modeling_the_callees_for_the_ordervalidation_procedure_ELTPARAGRAPHE000029"></a>

The reverse modeling of callees for the "OrderValidation" procedure is as follows
<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Retro_ExempleGeneral.gif)


The different elements of this graph are as follows:

1. Process for which the reverse modeling was performed.

2. Process called.

3. Non-detailed group of processes.

4. Detailed group of processes.




**What is a group of processes?**
A group of processes is used to group the processes by feature, in order to get a synthetic vision of the architecture of the processes. In this example, the "OrderValidation" procedure runs the "StockModification" procedure that runs two other procedures. This set is a group of processes.

In the graph, a group of processes can be detailed or not. The ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Retro_AugmenteDetails.gif)  icon is used to expand a group of processes and ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Retro_DiminueDetails.gif) is used to collapse a group of processes.

The final graphs can be modified in the modeling editor in order to display more details, to add comments, ...

## How to?
<a name="how_ELTTEXTE000221"></a>
To perform a reverse code modeling: 

1. Start the wizard for reverse modeling: 

	- select "Reverse-modeling" from the popup menu of the procedure ("Project explorer" pane).

	- from the code editor. To do so, position the mouse cursor on the name of a procedure, in a process, a procedure, a class code, ... and select "Reverse-modeling" from the popup menu.

	- from the cross-reference window of a procedure (opened by "Shift+F2"): click the "Reverse modeling of callers" button ("Callers" tab) or the "Reverse modeling of callees" ("Callees" tab).




2. Choose the requested type of graph: Graph of callees or Graph of callers.

3. Enter the name of the flexible modeling that will be generated.
	This name has the following format by default: "Reverse modeling of &lt;callees/callers&gt; by &lt;Procedure Name>".

4. Select the options for coloring the modeling. You have the ability to color the processes: in this case, all the processes belonging to the same project element (window, class, ...) will use the same color.
	You also have the ability to enable the alignment grid in the modeling editor.

5. The processes can be grouped by feature. 
	We advise you to create groupings when reverse modeling is performed on complex procedures. They provide a synthetic view before exploring the code step by step.
	For smaller processes, we advise you not to create groups in order to directly access the maximum level of details. However, the level of details cannot be modified in the modeling editor.

6. Validate the creation of the graph. The modeling editor is opened and the generated graph is displayed.

### Changing the level of details in the modeling
<a name="changing_the_level_details_the_modeling_ELTPARAGRAPHE000083"></a>

If you have chosen to generate a graph while grouping the processes by feature, the level of details can be changed in the modeling.


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| **Grouped processes** | **Detailed processes** |

**To increase the level of details**: 

- of a process: double-click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Retro_AugmenteDetails.gif) in the process displayed in the modelling.

- of all processes in the graph: click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Retro_AugmenteDetailsTout.gif) in the toolbar.




**To reduce the level of details**:

- of a process: double-click the ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Retro_DiminueDetails.gif) icon in the process.

- of all processes in the graph: click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Retro_DiminueDetailsTout.gif) in the toolbar.
