## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000147"></a>
Who hasn't wanted to define their own keyboard shortcuts, to easily and quickly access the most used features of an application? WINDEV applications offer this functionality to all users. You can create and modify the keyboard shortcuts of your WINDEV applications. 

The keyboard shortcut can be created if it does not exist. 

The default keyboard shortcut can be modified if it does not suit you. In this case, you can use the default shortcut or the new one.

Reminder: The keyboard shortcut of a button is defined in the "UI" tab of the Button control description window ("Keyboard shortcut" option).

Validate.

**Remarks**: 

- If the selected shortcut is already used in the window, a message indicates that the selected shortcut cannot be used.

- The custom shortcut is automatically displayed in the button tooltip. If a text is already displayed in the tooltip, the shortcut is displayed at the end of the text.

- If the button contains a caption, the custom shortcut is automatically displayed at the end of the button caption.

- If the "&lt;None&gt;" shortcut is selected, the default behavior of the button (intended by the developer) will be restored.
