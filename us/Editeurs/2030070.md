## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000164"></a>
With the WEBDEV Application Server in version 27, you can create server clusters with ease. 
Clusters make it possible to install as many application servers as desired, and thus to distribute the site workload across these servers.

There are several simple steps to install and use a WEBDEV cluster. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Serveur%20Application%20Cluster.gif)


**Step 1: The first application server** 
To start, install the first application server in cluster mode on a physical Windows server (or VM) at the location of your choice. 
The Cluster mode can be selected when installing the application server. 

For more details, see [Installing a WEBDEV cluster](../Editeurs/1410086635.md).






**Step 2: The other application servers** 
When installing the other servers, simply indicate that they must join an existing cluster. 
The cluster must then "accept" the new application server (for security reasons). 
Each application server can be installed on a physical server (or VM) at any location you want: datacenter of your choice, in your premises,... 


The new application server adopts the settings of the cluster, as well as the accounts. 

The new server is added to the existing cluster, and synchronizes automatically: the sites on the other machines in the cluster are automatically installed on the new server.

For more details, see [Installing a WEBDEV cluster](../Editeurs/1410086635.md).




**Step 3: The load balancer**
Next, install a Proxy which will distribute the sessions across the different servers. 
You can use a proxy of your choice to distribute the load across the different application servers. 
Remark: You can find an example of an HAProxy configuration file in the "Cluster" tab of the WEBDEV Application Server administrator . 

For more details, see [WEBDEV cluster: Proxy configuration](../WDAdminDeploiement/3539085.md).




**Step 4: The database** 
The database can be at any location. When using a WEBDEV Cluster, the data must not be on the WEBDEV Application Servers. The site data directory is not synchronized.




**Step 5: Install sites and webservices on the cluster**
You can follow the same steps to install sites and webservices on the WEBDEV cluster and on a standard WEBDEV Application Server. However, you will need to perform the installation on the proxy, so that the different cluster nodes synchronize with one another afterwards.
