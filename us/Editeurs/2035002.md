## Elements of a collaboration diagram
<a name="elements_collaboration_diagram_ELTTEXTE000105"></a>
A collaboration diagram includes the following elements:

- **object**: represents the different objects used.

- **actor**: represents an element external to the system. A person, for example.

- **message**: represents the messages exchanged between different objects.

- **package**: divides and organizes the diagram representation (in the same way that directories organize files).
