## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000194"></a>
The stored procedures and the triggers are debugged from the environment, with real execution on the server. You can:

- run the test of a stored procedure: by itself from the editor (see [Stored procedure](../WDLang4/3044360.md)).

- connect the debugger onto an existing connection to trace a problem in real time.




This last case will be presented in this help page.

### Testing an HFSQL Client/Server connection
<a name="testing_hfsql_clientserver_connection_ELTPARAGRAPHE000027"></a>

To test an HFSQL Client/Server connection:

1. Open the desired project in the editor.

2. Display the analysis linked to the project: click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Ico_Analyse.gif)
 in the quick access buttons.

3. On the "Project" tab, in the "Test mode" group, expand "Test mode" and select "Debug on an HFSQL server".

4. In the screen that is displayed, select:

	- the user identified on the server for debugging.

	- the mode for running the test and the debugger.







Three start modes are available:

- Starting the project and debugging the next connections to the database.

- Debugging the next connections to the database coming from a specific user for a specific application.

- Debugging an existing connection.

### Mode 1: Starting the project and debugging the next connections to the database
<a name="mode_1_starting_the_project_and_debugging_the_next_connections_the_database_ELTPARAGRAPHE000062"></a>

This option is used to:

- start the current project (without the debugger), 

- debug the stored procedures and the triggers used from the project on a database. The elements deployed on the server are run.




**To use this debug mode**: 

- The port used for debugging is port 27281 by default. This port must be opened if a firewall is used. Indeed, the communication between the development computer and the end-user computer is done via socket. This port can be modified in the [HFConf.INI file](../WDLang4/3044345.md).

- The user who handles the database must have the rights to debug the database.




**Remarks**: 

- The Ctrl + Pause combination cannot be used to start the debugger. You have the ability to use breakpoints.

- The F7 keys cannot be used on [HExecuteProcedure](../WDLang4/3044358.md) or [HExecuteQuery](../WDLang4/3044080.md).

- [InTestMode](../WDLang1/3013011.md) returns <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>.

### Mode 2: Debugging the next connections to the database coming from a specific user for a specific application
<a name="mode_2_debugging_the_next_connections_the_database_coming_from_specific_user_for_specific_application_ELTPARAGRAPHE000098"></a>

This option allows you to debug the stored procedures and the triggers used from any connection that complies with the filter criteria. If the filter criteria are not restrictive enough, there may be too many calls to the debugger. The elements deployed on the server are run.

**To use this debug mode**: 

- The port used for debugging is port 27281 by default. This port must be opened if a firewall is used. Indeed, the communication between the development computer and the end-user computer is done via socket. This port can be modified in the [HFConf.INI file](../WDLang4/3044345.md).

- The user who handles the database must have:

	- the rights to debug the database, 

	- the rights to debug any connection.





**Remark**: [InTestMode](../WDLang1/3013011.md) returns <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>.
<a name="NOTE2_4"></a>


### Mode 3: Debugging an existing connection
<a name="mode_3_debugging_existing_connection_ELTPARAGRAPHE000125"></a>

This option allows you to debug the stored procedures and the triggers used from an existing connection. The elements deployed on the server are run.

**To use this debug mode**: 

- The port used for debugging is port 27281 by default. This port must be opened if a firewall is used. Indeed, the communication between the development computer and the end-user computer is done via socket. This port can be modified in the [HFConf.INI file](../WDLang4/3044345.md).

- The user who handles the database must have:

	- the rights to debug the database, 

	- the rights to debug any connection.





**Remark**: [InTestMode](../WDLang1/3013011.md) returns <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>.
