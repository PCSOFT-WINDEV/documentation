## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000093"></a>
An activity diagram represents the behavior of a method or the flow of a use case.

For example, the following diagram presents the flow of a dam:<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_UML_Diagramme_activite%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)

## Elements of an activity diagram
<a name="elements_activity_diagram_ELTTEXTE000117"></a>
An activity diagram includes the following elements:

- **activity**: represents a specific step in a workflow. For example: "Create a quote", "Open a window", "Evaluate", etc.

- **synchronization bar**: synchronizes different activities:

	- by indicating the activities that must be performed before a given activity. For example: "Press clutch" and "Change gear" before "Release clutch".

	- by indicating the activities that will happen in parallel.




- **object**: relates activities to the object that performs them. For example, the "Order" and "Pay" activities are related to the "Customer" object; the "Teach" and "Evaluate" activities are related to the "Teacher" object.

- **send signal**: represents a signal sent to an object.

- **accept event**: represents the acceptance of an event coming from an object.

- **transition**: shows the passage from a terminated activity to another activity. For example: "Too much water", "Enough money", etc.

- **package**: divides and organizes the diagram representation (in the same way that directories organize files).

- **initial state**: represents the status of the process before the activity starts. Several different initial states can be found.

- **final state**: represents the state of the process at the end of the activity. Several different final states can be found.
