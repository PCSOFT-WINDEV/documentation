## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000231"></a>
Deployment to the App Store is the most common deployment mode. 

It is used when the application is intended for the general public. In this mode, installations and updates are fully managed by Apple's App Store.

**Benefits**:

- Simple setup for the user.

- Automatic updates.


**Drawbacks**:

- Application accessible by any user.

- Apple checks the application automatically and manually prior to publication and may reject or remove an application based on their own criteria.

## Generating the application
<a name="generating_the_application_ELTTEXTE000279"></a>
We advise you to read: 

- the list of prerequisites specified by Apple: [https://developer.apple.com/appstore/resources/submission/index.html](https://developer.apple.com/appstore/resources/submission/index.html)

- the help page [Principle for developing an iPhone/iPad application](../Editeurs/1000019863.md). 




Caution: You must: 

- Provide 3 PNG images that will be used as icon for your application. These images must have the following dimensions: 57x57, 72x72 and 114x114. 
	Tip : Create a 512x512 image and include this image in your custom image catalog. When generating the application, select this image in the catalog : WINDEV Mobile will build the 3 images to the proper dimensions.

- Provide 4 images in PNG format that will be used as splash screen, with the following dimensions : 320x480, 640x960, 768x1004 and 1024x748

The different steps are as follows: 

- Connect to the following address: [http://itunesconnect.apple.com](http://itunesconnect.apple.com)

- Click "My apps". <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=itunes_connect1.gif)

## Deploying on the App Store
<a name="deploying_the_app_store_ELTTEXTE000333"></a>


### Compilation on Mac
<a name="compilation_mac_ELTPARAGRAPHE000150"></a>

To deploy on the App Store:

- Generate your application in WINDEV Mobile. For more details, see [Generating an iOS application](../Editeurs/1000019908.md). 

- At the end of generation, copy your "YourApplication.xcode.gen" directory onto your MAC.

- Start Xcode and connect with your Apple account. The necessary files are automatically downloaded. 

- Load your project. Compile your project. 

- When the application is compiled, an archive must be built via "Product .. Archive". <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=XCode_archive1.gif)

	Remark: If the "Archive" option is grayed out, deselect the specified target device and select "None/Any". 

- The organizer is automatically started on the "Archive" tab. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=xcode_archive2.gif)


- An "Upload to App Store" button is used to send the application to the App Store. 







### Deployment with iTunes Connect
<a name="deployment_with_itunes_connect_ELTPARAGRAPHE000172"></a>

In iTunes Connect: 

- Create (if necessary) a version of the application. The version number of application must correspond to the version number specified when creating the application generation in WINDEV Mobile (or the version number of WINDEV Mobile must start with the same number). <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=itunes_connect4.gif)


- Specify the information regarding the version. 
	Remark: Some options are used to manage the publication automatically (or not) once the application is validated. 

- Specify the build to use. You must find the build that was previsously send by Xcode. 
	Remark: the process time can be quite long (several minutes). 

- Click the "Submit for validation" button. The application switches to the automatic review step. Depending on your deployment options, you will receive an email during the validation by Apple and the application can be (or will be) deployed.
