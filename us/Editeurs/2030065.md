## Overview

WINDEV allows you to automatically generate and install a 64-bit application.

### Creating an executable in 64-bit mode
<a name="creating_executable_64bit_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000018"></a>

To create an executable in 64-bit mode: 

1. Create a specific project configuration for 64-bit. For more details, see [Project configuration](../Editeurs/9000030.md). This project configuration contains all the elements of your project. 

2. If necessary, select the created project configuration. 

3. Expand ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_generation_exe64.gif) in the quick access buttons and select "Generate the 64-bit Windows executable (.exe)". 

4. Follow the different steps of [the wizard for executable creation](../Editeurs/2025002.md).




Remark: By using a project configuration specific to the 64-bit mode, the executable and all the files required by the executable will be generated in a specific directory.

### Installing a 64-bit application
<a name="installing_64bit_application_ELTPARAGRAPHE000040"></a>

To install a 64-bit application, WINDEV proposes two modes: 

- **Installing the 64-bit application only** 
	This mode is used to generate the setup program for the 64-bit application only. To create the setup program, on the "Project" tab, in the "Generation" group, click "Setup procedure" (the 64-bit configuration of the application must be selected). The wizard for creating the setup procedure is automatically started (see [Wizard for creating the setup program](../Editeurs/2028062.md)). 
	Remark: The setup program of the 64-bit application is a 64-bit program.

- **Installing the application in 32-bit or 64-bit mode** (with adaptation according to the deployment system)
	WINDEV allows you to create a unique setup containing both the "32-bit" application and the "64-bit" application. The version to install will be automatically selected according to the operating system of the user. Let's take a look at this option.

### Combined 32-bit/64-bit setup
<a name="combined_32bit64bit_setup_ELTPARAGRAPHE000071"></a>

To perform a combined 32-bit/64-bit setup: 

1. Generate the executable and the 32-bit setup procedure. 

	- Display the 32-bit configuration if necessary: 

		- from the "Project explorer" pane. 

		- on the "Project" tab, in the "Project configuration" group, click "Manage configurations". 




- Generate the executable and the 32-bit setup procedure: click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_generation_exe.gif) in the quick access buttons. 

2. Generate the executable and the 64-bit setup procedure. 

	- Display the 64-bit configuration if necessary: 

		- from the "Project explorer" pane, 

		- on the "Project" tab, in the "Project configuration" group, click "Manage configurations".  




- Generate the executable and the 64-bit setup procedure (click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_generation_exe64.gif) in the quick access buttons. 

3. Generate the combined setup: on the "Project" tab, in the "Generation" group, click "Setup procedure" and select "Generate a combined 32-bit/64-bit setup". The following window appears:<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Install_combinee.gif&type=thumb)


4. Specify the paths of the different setup programs (WDF files of 32-bit and 64-bit setups). If these files are not created or updated, you have the ability to re-generate the different setups. 
	Remark: The help about the new features displayed during the setup can be modified.

5. In the next step, specify the options for generating the combined setup: 

	- single generation directory.

	- directory cleared before generation.

	- directory for creating the combined setup. 

	- compression format of combined setup (Zip or 7Z).




6. Validate. 

7. If you have requested the generation of setup programs, validate the different wizards for generating the executable and the setup program. 

8. The combined setup program is generated. 




Remarks: 

- The combined 32/64-bit setup is not available for the multisite setups.

- The history of versions defined for each setup program is supported: you can go back to a previous version of the software. 

- The signature of combined setups is available: each setup can be signed.

- Setup media: each installation must have a unique directory as setup media. 

- The setup program of the 32-bit application is a 32-bit program. The setup program of the 64-bit application is a 64-bit program.

- The combined 32/64-bit setup can use different and custom setup programs. Simply select the "WDF" file that corresponds to the desired setup program.
