## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000224"></a>
A style sheet is a ".STY" file. A style sheet groups:

- the style of window controls (background color, font, border, ...), 

- the information regarding the aspect of window controls (background image, dimension, ...).




The custom style sheets can be handled from the interface of window editor. For more details, see [Custom style sheet](../Editeurs/2016015.md).

Handling the styles via the ".STY" files is an advanced WINDEV option.

From the ".STY" file, you can:

- [see all the styles found in a ".STY" file](#NOTE2).

- [modify a style in a ".STY" file](#NOTE3).

- [delete a style from a ".STY" file](#NOTE3).

- [import a style into a ".STY" file](#NOTE4).

- [define the default style for a type of control](#NOTE5).

- the style defined by default in the custom style sheet.

- the style defined by default in the style sheet of the skin template associated with the current window.

- the style defined by default in the default style sheet of WINDEV.
