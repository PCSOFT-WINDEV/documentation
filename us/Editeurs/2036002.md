### Configuration required for installing WINDEV
<a name="configuration_required_for_installing_windev_ELTPARAGRAPHE000022"></a>

We will distinguish between the configuration of the development computer (your computer) and the configuration required for the applications developed by WINDEV to operate (the end-user computers).

**Development computer**:

- Screen: minimum size: 1920 x 1080

- 4 GB of RAM (8 GB or more recommended).

- 4 GB of disk space (10 GB for a full setup: the software includes hundreds of examples).

- running Windows Vista or 7 (32 or 64-bit) or later. 

- Caution: To install WINDEV, you must be connected as computer administrator. 




**User computer**:

- 2 GB of RAM.

- running Windows Vista or 7 (32 or 64-bit) or later. An SSE2 processor is required.




You will notice that the WINDEV source code is identical regardless of the Windows version on which the programs will be run.

Remark: When the development computer has a screen with a high resolution, the font size in the WINDEV editors may be too small to be readable. This is the case on a Macbook retina in 2 560 x 1 600 or on the Windows computers in 3 000 x 1 800. To increase the size of all the fonts: 

1. Open the general options of WINDEV ("Home" tab, "Environment" group, "Options"). 

2. Go to the "General" tab. 

3. In "DPI management", select "Let Windows manage DPI".

4. The DPI settings will be applied next time WINDEV Mobile is started.


For more details, see [WINDEV options](../Editeurs/2036001.md).

## Setup
<a name="setup_ELTTEXTE000427"></a>
The setup is very easy, simply follow the instructions included with the setup package.

You can install WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile separately, or integrate them into WINDEV if it is already installed. Up to version 25, this integration is only allowed in 64-bit mode. From version 26, you can integrate WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile into WINDEV in 64-bit and 32-bit mode.

To make things easier, the setup procedure automatically creates the "WINDEV", "WEBDEV" or "WINDEV Mobile" program group in "Start .. Programs" and installs the necessary files.

The WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile setup wizard proposes to help improve the product by allowing the collection of information on how the product is used. This optional and anonymous data collection allows PC SOFT to improve its products.

## Dongle
<a name="dongle_ELTTEXTE000481"></a>
The dongle supplied with your product is specific to the development environment.

This dongle is not required for the end users or for the hosting company of your Internet sites.

The principle is simple, the dongle must be plugged in when the product is used.

Two types of keys are available, the key that goes on the parallel port of your computer (most common one) or the USB key.

To make sure that the parallel key operates properly, you must:

- insert the key into the parallel port of your computer when it is switched off

- connect your printer to the dongle

- switch the computer and the printer on

- start a print job




If the document is printed, your dongle is properly connected.

For the USB key, plug it into an available USB port and start WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile.

**Remark**: If the dongle is switched off or if it blinks, see the following FAQ: [Installing the driver required to recognize the dongle of WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV MOBILE](https://faq.pcsoft.fr/faqread.awp?idfaq=3519&lang=us).
