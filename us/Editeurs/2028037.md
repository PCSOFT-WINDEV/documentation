## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000247"></a>
The "WDSetup" project corresponds to the standard setup program of WINDEV applications.

This project supports French and English (US) by default.

**Remarks**: 

- If you are using a custom WDSetup, you must take into account the evolutions performed between the different versions. To apply the evolutions, use the file comparison: on the "Project" tab, in the "Other actions" group, expand "Compare" and select "Compare two projects". In the wizard, select your project and the WDSetup project provided with WINDEV.

- You can use a plug-in to add new features or new steps to the wizard. For more details, see [Customizing the setup program (Plug-in)](../Editeurs/2028109.md). 

- The WDSetup project comes with two configurations: a 32-bit configuration and a 64-bit configuration.

## Managing additional languages in WDSetup
<a name="managing_additional_languages_wdsetup_ELTTEXTE000271"></a>
To manage additional languages in WDSetup, you can: 

- Customize the example "WDSetup", delivered as standard with the product. 

- Create a new project based on the example "WDSetup". This solution is recommended because it eliminates the risk of overwriting the project during an update. 




**To create a new project based on WDSetup**: 

1. From the WINDEV home window, click on "Create a project". The project creation wizard starts. 

2. Give a name to your project and indicate the runtime platform. 

3. In "Description - Creation mode", choose "Create a project from an existing example". Go to the next step of the wizard. 

4. Choose the preset project to use: WDSetup. Go to the next step. 

5. Indicate if the project should be saved in the SCM (Source Code Manager). 

6. Validate. The project is automatically created. It contains all the elements of the example "WD Setup" and can be modified and customized. 




**To add the new languages to the WDSetup custom project**: 

1. Add the additional languages into the "Languages" tab of the project description. 
	 To open the project description, go to the "Project" tab, "Project" group and click "Description".

2. Translate the interface of the project (windows, controls, ...) as well as the code messages. 
	**Reminder**: WDMSG is used to simplify the translation of a project by checking out all the project messages (control captions, window titles, ...) and by checking them back in once they have been translated. WDMSG is an additional module of WINDEV. Contact PC SOFT Sales Department for more details about WDMSG.

3. Create a new executable for each configuration (32-bit configuration and 64-bit configuration). 
	Reminder: To create the executable: 

	- enable the desired configuration (32 bits or 64 bits). 

	- expand ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_generer.gif) in the quick access buttons. 

	- select "Generate the 32-bit executable (.exe)" or "Generate the 64-bit executable (.exe)". 
			In the wizard, don't forget to include the new languages in the executable.

## Running the test of custom WDSetup
<a name="running_the_test_custom_wdsetup_ELTTEXTE000295"></a>


### Overview
<a name="overview_ELTPARAGRAPHE000096"></a>

To run the test of a custom setup program (custom WDSetup), you must:

1. Configure the setup program and generate this setup program.

2. Run the test of the custom WDSetup project in WINDEV. To run this test, you must:

	- copy the files into the EXE directory of the custom setup program, 

	- enter a specific command line.

### Configuring and generating the setup program
<a name="configuring_and_generating_the_setup_program_ELTPARAGRAPHE000109"></a>

To configure the setup program and to generate this setup program: 

1. Configure the setup program with [the setup program creation wizard](../Editeurs/2028062.md) or in [the setup editor (WDInst)](../Editeurs/2028042.md).

2. If you are using the setup program creation wizard, generate the setup and start WDInst.

3. In the setup editor WDInst, select "Setup settings .. Options of the installer".

4. In the "WINDEV framework" tab, select (if necessary) "Copy the WINDEV framework with the setup". 
	Then, click the "Customizing the installer" tab. 
	Select "Use a custom installer" and select the executable of the custom setup program. 
	Remarks: 

	- Depending on the type of setup to perform, you can select the executable corresponding to the 32-bit setup program or to the 64-bit setup program.

	- The corresponding libraries (".DLL" files) can be associated with the executable of the custom setup program in the "Installer DLLs" tab (case of renamed libraries for example).




5. Validate the window for installer options. 

6. Select "File .. Generate".

7. To run the test, we recommend that you select a unique directory for the support of the setup program.

8. Specify the directory for generating the setup program.

9. In the "Advanced" tab, check "Keep the WXF file to run the test of a custom WDSetup". For more details, see [WXF file](../Editeurs/2028055.md).

10. Validate the window to generate the setup program.

### Running the test of custom WDSetup
<a name="running_the_test_custom_wdsetup_ELTPARAGRAPHE000147"></a>

To run the test of a custom WDSetup in WINDEV:

1. In the "EXE" directory (subdirectory corresponding to the 32-bit ot 64-bit configuration) of custom setup program (custom "WDSetup" project), copy the following files:

	- the "&lt;ApplicationName&gt;.WXF" file (found in the directory of project to install), 

	- the license files, if a license agreement is displayed at the beginning of the application setup, 

	- the image files used for the interface of the setup program (background image, logo, ...), 

	- the image files used for the slides of the setup program (if necessary).




2. In WINDEV, open the custom setup program (custom "WDSetup" project).

3. On the "Project" tab, in the "Test mode" group, expand "Test mode" and select "Configure test mode".

4. Enter the following command line: "/Dir=&lt;PathINSTALLDirectory&gt;", where &lt;PathINSTALLDirectory&gt; corresponds to the path of the INSTALL directory created in the generation directory of setup program. 
	For example, if the generation directory of the setup program is: "C:\\Temp", the path of the INSTALL directory will be: "C:\\Temp\\INSTALL".

5. Select the project configuration corresponding to the version to check (32 or 64 bits) and run the project test (Ctrl + F9).




Caution: When this test is run, the setup is actually performed in the specified directory.
