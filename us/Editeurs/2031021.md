## The steps for creating a RAD pattern
<a name="the_steps_for_creating_rad_pattern_ELTTEXTE000129"></a>
The steps for creating a RAD pattern are as follows:

1. **Creating the "RAD Pattern" project.** 

2. [Creating the different windows and pages of the pattern](../Editeurs/2031022.md).

3. [Generating the RAD pattern](../Editeurs/2031023.md).

4. [Using the RAD pattern](../Editeurs/2031024.md).

## Creating the RAD Pattern project
<a name="creating_the_rad_pattern_project_ELTTEXTE000153"></a>
The RAD pattern is created from a "RAD Pattern" project.

To create a "RAD Pattern" project:

1. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_nouveau.gif) in the quick access buttons. The new element window appears: click "Project".

2. In the wizard project:

	- In the "Project type" step, select the "Pattern RAD" option.

	- In the next step, enter the name of the project that will be used as the basis for creating the pattern.

	- The other options for project creation are the standard options. A style book can be selected for your project.  




3. Validate the project creation wizard.

4. The project is automatically created and associated with an analysis. This analysis contains the necessary files for creating a RAD that can be adapted to all the file configurations.




Remark: WEBDEV integrated in WINDEV: A "RAD pattern" configuration only supports windows, patterns for WEBDEV cannot be generated.

## The analysis of the RAD Pattern project

### Analysis
<a name="analysis_ELTPARAGRAPHE000054"></a>All the "RAD Pattern" projects are associated with the same analysis. This analysis contains all the types of links and groups of files.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Projet_Pattern_RAD%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)
This analysis contains:

- a single file (RADFileC for example).

- two files linked by a simple link (RADFileB linked to RAD FileC or RADFileA linked to RADFileB for example).

- two files (and a relation file) linked by a complex link (RADFileB linked to RADFileC via the relation file RADFileD).




Any analysis can be divided into several sets of these three groups of files.

### Example of application
<a name="example_application_ELTPARAGRAPHE000069"></a>

Let's try to divide the following analysis: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=RAD_Analyse_Ex.gif)


The following groups are created:

- Customer.

- Order.

- Product.

- Supplier.

- Customer linked to Orders.

- Orders linked to Product by the link file named OrdLine.

- Product linked to Supplier.
