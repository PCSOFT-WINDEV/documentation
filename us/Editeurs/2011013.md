## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000123"></a>
The relationships are used to link entities among themselves or to link associations to entities.

The data model editor allows you to easily create relationships.

When [generating the LDM from the CDM](../Editeurs/2011020.md), the relationships will automatically become [links](../Editeurs/2011008.md).
