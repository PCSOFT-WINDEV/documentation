Two methods can be used to include the User Groupware:

- **the default integration**: the entire programming of the User Groupware is automatically included in your application.
	The login window or page is automatically included in your project. The login window or page is displayed when the application is started, allowing the user to connect to the application. You can customize this window or page by applying the skin template of your application for example.

- **custom integration**: the entire programming of the User Groupware is automatically included in your application. 
	All the windows or pages required to manage the User Groupware (login window or page, windows or pages for user management) are automatically added to your project. You can customize all the windows or pages used by the user groupware.

| **Login window** | ***GPWLOGIN.WDW*** | This window allows all the application users to connect to the application. In this window, the user must enter the name and password (optional) that were previously defined by the application supervisor.<br><br>During the startup, you have the ability to use the "SUPERVISOR" login and the "SUPERVISOR" password.<br><br>**Remark**: From version 120044, the login window does no longer propose the list of users by default.
