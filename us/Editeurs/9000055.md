## Developing a Linux site
<a name="developing_linux_site_ELTTEXTE000366"></a>
The method for developing a site for Linux is identical to the method for developing a site for Windows.

To indicate that your site will be deployed on Linux: 

1. Open the description window of the current configuration: on the "Project" tab, in the "Project configuration" group, click "Current configuration". 

2. Click on "Compatibility" and check the option "Enable compilation errors for Linux compatibility".






Starting with version 27, the following Linux distributions are supported:

- Debian 9 or later

- Fedora 25 or later

- Ubuntu 18.04 or higher (minimum GCC version: 5.1)

- OpenSUSE:Leap:15.0 with GCC 7. OpenSUSE Leap 15.2 is also supported.




Starting with version 27, the following Linux distributions are no longer supported: 

- CentOS 7 (GCC 4.8)





The site can also be deployed in a [Docker image](../Editeurs/3539080.md) of the WEBDEV Application Server.
