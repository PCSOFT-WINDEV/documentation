## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000203"></a>
"Custom-Folders" simplify the organization of projects, allowing you to group the elements of your application by themes. Custom-Folders are available: 

- for each category of elements in the "Project explorer" pane: windows, reports, ...

- at project level. 




**Remarks**:

- You can also create Custom-Folders in the data model editor. For more details, see [Custom-Folders in the analysis](../Editeurs/2011003.md).

- You also have the ability to organize a large project via the [internal components](../Editeurs/2014100.md).

<a name="create_customfolder_ELTPARAGRAPHE000032"></a>

To create a Custom-Folder:

1. Display the "Project explorer" pane if necessary.

2. Select the folder in which the Custom-Folder will be created: Windows, Pages, ...

3. Select "New Custom-Folder" in the popup menu.

4. Enter the name of the Custom-Folder and validate. The Custom-Folder appears in the "Project explorer" pane as a yellow folder. This Custom-Folder can be customized. For more details, see [Actions that can be performed on a Custom-Folder](#NOTE3_1).




**Remarks**:

- If you are using SCM, you must be Master on the project to create a Custom-Folder: the Custom-Folder will be carried over during the next synchronization. Otherwise, the created Custom-Folder will disappear during the next synchronization.

- Custom-Folders are available in the sets of procedures.

### Associating the project elements with a Custom-Folder
<a name="associating_the_project_elements_with_customfolder_ELTPARAGRAPHE000061"></a>

**To associate a project element with a Custom-Folder**: 

1. Select the requested element in the "Project explorer" pane. 

2. Drag and Drop the element to the requested Custom-Folder. 




**To associate the same element with several Custom-Folders**, hold the Ctrl key down during the Drag and Drop to the Custom-Folder.

**Remark**: When saving a new element, the following window is displayed: 
<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=PersoDossier.GIF)

This window is used to specify the custom-folder to which the current element will be associated. 
In order for this window to be automatically displayed each time a new element is saved, check "Ask for the location of the new elements in the project" in the "Options" tab of the project description ("Project" tab, "Project" group, "Description").

**A project element can be associated with several Custom-Folders.**

**Remark**: **Custom-Folder and SCM**: 
If you are using the SCM, you must be master on the project to associate a new element with a Custom-Folder. In this case, to retrieve the element in the Custom-Folder, the other developers must: 

- go to the "SCM" tab, "Project" group, expand "Master/Guest". 

- select "Get the Master version (full)".  In all the other cases, the element will be retrieved but it will not be included in the Custom-Folder.

- A guest can include an element in a Custom-Folder. However, the other developers cannot retrieve the element in the same Custom-Folder: they will only retrieve the element.
