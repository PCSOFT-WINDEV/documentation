## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000349"></a>
In a setup program, you may want to customize some actions, add steps to the wizard, add new processes, etc.

Until version 21, you had to modify the source code of the setup program by using the "WDSetup" project supplied with the product. For each new version, the modifications had to be applied to the new version of WDSetup. For more details, see [Modifying WDSetup to manage additional languages](../Editeurs/2028037.md). 

In version 21, you have the ability to create a plug-in and to modify the standard setup program. This plug-in is created form the "WD WDSETUP Plugin" example supplied with WINDEV. 

This allows you to benefit from the evolutions of standard setup while performing customizations.

## How to?
<a name="how_ELTTEXTE000373"></a>


### Principle
<a name="principle_ELTPARAGRAPHE000027"></a>

1. [Open the "WD WDSETUP Plugin" project](#NOTE2_2). 

2. [Modify the project](#NOTE2_3). 

3. [Generate the library](#NOTE2_4). 

4. [Modify the setup program of your application](#NOTE2_5). 




Remark: Go to [Interactions with the plug-in according to the types of setup](#NOTE3_1) to see the order in which the procedures are executed based on the type of installation. 
<a name="NOTE2_2"></a>


### 1. Opening the "WD WDSETUP Plugin" project
<a name="1_opening_the_wdsetup_plugin_project_ELTPARAGRAPHE000050"></a>

1. Open the "WD WDSETUP Plugin" project. This project is available in the training examples of WINDEV. 
	Remark: We advise you to perform a backup copy of this example in order to customize it without any risk of overwriting when installing a new version. 

2. This sample project is used to create a sample plugin: associating the WDINFO file with the application. 

3. This project contains: 

	- **An internal window named "IW_INSTALLCUSTOMPLANE"**. This internal window corresponds to the new information displayed by the plug-in. Each plane of the internal window corresponds to a new step of the wizard. To see the different planes in the editor, press [Page Up] or [Page Down]. The first plane corresponds to the example (associating the WDINFO file with the application). 

	- **A set of procedures named "SET_WDSETUPPLUGIN"**. This set of procedures contains the prototype procedures of procedures to modify for the plug-in. 

	- **A set of procedures named "SET_SHELL_ASSOCIATION"**. This set of procedures contains the procedures used by the plug-in example.  






<a name="NOTE2_3"></a>


### 2. Adapting the "WD WDSETUP Plugin" project
<a name="2_adapting_the_wdsetup_plugin_project_ELTPARAGRAPHE000071"></a>

To create a plug-in, the project must contain: 

- The set of procedures named "SET_WDSETUPPLUGIN". 

- An internal window. 

- A set of procedures containing the plug-in procedures. 




**The set of procedures named "SET_WDSETUPPLUGIN"**

The set of procedures named "SET_WDSETUPPLUGIN" contains the prototype of functions that will be called by the main setup program. The name of these functions must not be modified.

The code of these functions must be filled according to the process that will be added into the plugin.

This functions are (in alphabetical order): 

- **BeforeAutoModif**: Procedure called before the automatic data modification. 

- **AfterAutoModif**: Procedure called after the automatic data modification.

- **BeforeInstall**: Procedure called when starting the setup.

- **AfterInstall**: Procedure called after the setup.

- **Startup**: Procedure for initializing the plug-in, called when starting the setup.

- **BeforeUpload**: Procedure called before sending by FTP (HTTP reference setup). 

- **AfterUpload**: Procedure called after sending by FTP (HTTP reference setup).

- **sCustomPlane**: Procedure used to declare an internal window to display in the setup wizard.
	This procedure must:

	- return an empty string if there is no internal window to display, 

	- return the name of the internal window to display during the call to the plugin ("IW_INSTALLCUSTOMPLANE" in the example). 







To see the order in which the functions are executed based on the type of installation, go to [Interactions with the plug-in according to the types of setup](#NOTE3_1). 



**The internal window**

This internal window contains the different custom steps of the setup wizard. Each new step corresponds to a plane of the internal window. The planes of this internal window will be displayed in the setup wizard, before the setup completion step. 
The name of this internal window is not important. It must be used in the **sCustomPlane** procedure. 
The internal window must contain:

- one or more planes. These planes correspond to the information displayed by the plug-in. 

- 3 local procedures. These local procedures are used to manage the initialization of planes, to perform checks and to indicate the sequence of planes. The 3 procedures must respect the following prototypes:  

	- **Init**: procedure used to initialize the controls found in the different planes. 

	- **bControl**: procedure used to validate (or not) the move to the next plane (sequence of planes.

	- **nNextPlane**:  procedure used to return the number of the plane to display (plane 1 by default).

### 3. Generating the "WD WDSETUP Plugin" project library
<a name="3_generating_the_wdsetup_plugin_project_library_ELTPARAGRAPHE000128"></a>

To generate the project library, go to the "Project" tab, "Generation" group and click "Generate". The library creation wizard starts. Follow the different steps of the wizard. The library is generated in the Exe directory of the project. 
<a name="NOTE2_5"></a>


### 4. Modifying the setup program
<a name="4_modifying_the_setup_program_ELTPARAGRAPHE000147"></a>

To include the plug-in: 

1. Open the desired project in WINDEV. 

2. Start the setup program creation wizard: on the "Project" tab, in the "Generation" group, expand "Setup procedure" and select "Create setup procedure". 

3. Create the executable and follow the different steps of the wizard. 

4. In the "Setup media" step, click the "Advanced options of installer" button. 

5. In the window that is displayed, display the "Plug-in" tab and select the file corresponding to the plug-in library that was created beforehand (wdl file). 

6. End the setup program creation wizard. 




Remark: The plug-in characteristics can also be defined in the setup editor WDInst ("Setup parameters .. Installer options").

## Interactions with the plug-in according to the types of setup
<a name="interactions_with_the_plugin_according_the_types_setup_ELTTEXTE000421"></a>
This paragraph presents the different interactions between the setup and the plug-in. The available types of setup are as follows: 

- [Simple setup.](#NOTE3_2)

- [Setup with automatic update in local network.](#NOTE3_3)

- [Setup with automatic update by HTTP.](#NOTE3_4)

6. If the plug-in is used, call to the "BeforeInstall" method. 

7. Installing the application update

8. If the plug-in is used, call to the "AfterInstall" method. 

9. Updating the registry if necessary. 

10. Updating the ini file if necessary.
