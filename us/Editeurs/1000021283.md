To increase the security of user groupware, WINDEV and WEBDEV now encrypt the passwords of users.

## Implementation
<a name="implementation_ELTTEXTE000121"></a>
The encryption of passwords is automatically included from version 200057 when implementing the User Groupware. 

For a version 20 project where the user groupware is already in place, the application must be recompiled and deployed, and password encryption must be activated by the user identified in "Administrator" mode.. 

**CAUTION**: When implementing the encryption of passwords on an existing project: 

- The existing passwords will be migrated.

- This operation cannot be undone.

- If the files of user accounts are shared with other applications or sites, all the sites and applications must be updated with version 200057 (or later). Otherwise, you will not be able to connect to the application or to the site.




The different steps are as follows: 

1. Depending on the integration mode of the user groupware: 

	- **If the automatic User Groupware is used**: Recompile the application with the new version of WINDEV or WEBDEV (version 200057 or later). 

	- **If the custom groupware is used**: Update the internal component named "WDGPU" with the new version of WINDEV or WEBDEV (version 200057 or later) and recompile the application with the new version of WINDEV or WEBDEV (version 200057 or later). 




2. Deploy the application. 

3. Start the application, connect in administrator mode and choose to configure the User Groupware. 

4. The "Enable the encryption of passwords" button is displayed in the management window (upper-right corner). <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=GPU_Cryptage.gif)
Click this button to use the encryption of passwords. 

5. A warning message is displayed before performing the encryption of passwords: 

	- The existing passwords will be migrated.

	- This operation cannot be undone.

	- If the files of user accounts are shared with other applications, all the applications must be updated with version 200057 (or later). Otherwise, you will not be able to connect to the application.

	- Validate. 







Remarks: 

- These operations are identical for a WINDEV project and for a WEBDEV project. 

- If you are using the User Groupware in compatible mode, the passwords cannot be encrypted. 

- When the passwords have been encrypted, the "Enable the encryption of passwords" button is not available anymore.
