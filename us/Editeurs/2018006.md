	From version <B>18</B>, the User Groupware evolves. This help page corresponds to the User Groupware kept for backward compatibility. For help on the new version of the User Groupware, see [User Groupware](../Editeurs/1000021152.md).

## Configure the application
<a name="configure_the_application_ELTTEXTE000148"></a>
The User Groupware is configured by the supervisor of the application. This setting consists in creating users and groups of users, and in granting them specific rights for each control found in each window or page of the application. These rights are used to gray controls, groups of controls or menu options, and to make them visible or invisible.

**To configure the User Groupware,** you must:

1. Start the application (executable or test from WINDEV or WEBDEV) and connect as supervisor:

	- Name: SUPERVISOR

	- Password: SUPERVISOR




2. Select "Configure groupware".

## Managing the users
<a name="managing_the_users_ELTTEXTE000172"></a>
To create a new user, you must specify:

- the user's last name (mandatory)

- the user's first name

- the username. This username is the identifier used to log in to the application.

- the user's password. This password is optional and it can be entered by the user himself during his first login (check the corresponding option).




**The user can be defined as being a supervisor of the application**.

You can also modify or delete users. When you delete a user, you can delete the entire user or their rights only.

**The users can be grouped.** When creating a group, you have the ability to copy the rights that were previously defined for another group or user.

A group can be created or deleted. When deleting a group, you have the ability to delete the group and its users or to delete the group only. In this case, the users are no longer associated with a group.

### Remarks
<a name="remarks_ELTPARAGRAPHE000050"></a>

- The supervisor password should be changed during the first use.

- The "Default" group is the group proposed by default in the User Groupware. By default, this group has all rights on the application.

- The &lt;None&gt; group and the DEFAULT group cannot be deleted.

- If you use an LDAP directory, you can import the users form the directory to manage their rights. For more details, see [User Groupware and LDAP](../Editeurs/2018013.md).

## Managing the rights
<a name="managing_the_rights_ELTTEXTE000202"></a>
The supervisor can manage the rights granted to each user (or group of users) on the elements found in the windows, window templates, pages and page templates of the project.

For each association between a user and a window/page, a specific status can be defined for all the elements found in the window or in the page. This can be done for window templates or page templates.

The elements managed in the windows, internal windows, pages, internal pages, window templates and page templates are as follows:

- the controls

- the groups of controls

- the menu options






The following states are available for each element:

- **Default**: the element behavior corresponds to the default behavior, defined in the application.

- **Inactive**: the element is displayed but no input can be performed.

- **Grayed**: the element is grayed. No input can be performed.

- **Invisible**: the element is not displayed.

### Special case: the supervisor does not have access to the window templates
<a name="special_case_the_supervisor_does_not_have_access_the_window_templates_ELTPARAGRAPHE000089"></a>

If the windows of user groupware have been included in your project, you can allow the supervisor to configure the internal windows and the window templates.

To do so, modify the code of the GPWConfigurationDetails window or the code of the GPWConfigurationDetails_WB page.

**Modification to perform in WINDEV**: Modify the initialization code of the COMBO_Window combo box as follows:


```wl
// Enumerate the windows
WindowName is string = EnumElement(enumWindow + enumInternalWindow + enumWindowTemplate)
WHILE WindowName <> ""
	ListAdd(COMBO_Window, WindowName) 
	// Next window
	WindowName = EnumElement() 
END
Window = 1
```


**Modification to perform in WEBDEV**: Modify the initialization code of the "Combo_Page" combo box as follows:


```wl
// Enumerate the windows
WindowName is string = EnumElement(enumDynamicPage + enumInternalPage + enumPageTemplate)
WHILE WindowName <> ""
	ListAdd(COMBO_Window, WindowName) 
	// Next window
	WindowName = EnumElement() 
END
Window = 1
```
