### Generating a Java application with WINDEV
<a name="generating_java_application_with_windev_ELTPARAGRAPHE000011"></a>

WINDEV allows you to generate a Java application without even knowing the Java language. The method for developing the application is identical to the method for developing any other WINDEV application.

When the WINDEV project is compiled, the windows and the WLanguage properties are automatically converted into Java.
