## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000201"></a>
When several data files are used in a query, the query editor automatically searches for the links between these files described in the analysis. These links are called joins in the query editor.

For example, the following query selects the numbers of the orders placed by the customers who live in Paris. The ORDERS and CUSTOMER data files are joined by the CustomerNum item. The query editor automatically defines the joins between these two data files.

**Remark**: The links between the data files appear in the query graphic representation only if the two linked data files are used by the query.

By default, the joins are automatically created by the query editor. However, these joins may not correspond to the desired result.. Therefore, you have the ability to add or delete joins. These operations are described in the following paragraphs.

## How to?
<a name="how_ELTTEXTE000225"></a>


### Adding a join into the current select query
<a name="adding_join_into_the_current_select_query_ELTPARAGRAPHE000024"></a>

To add a join to the current select query:

1. Right click the join and select "Edit join" in the context menu. The description window of the query joins appears.

2. Click the "Add a join" button. A window used to define a new join is displayed.

3. Specify the characteristics of the join to be added.

4. Validate. The join is automatically added to the query.




This gives you the ability to create multiple joins between two data files.

### Deleting a join from the current select query
<a name="deleting_join_from_the_current_select_query_ELTPARAGRAPHE000038"></a>

To delete a join from the current select query:

1. Right click the join and select "Edit join" in the context menu. The description window of the query joins appears.

2. Select the join to delete.

3. Click the "Delete join" button. The join is automatically deleted. The joins between data files are automatically optimized in order for the query to operate properly.

### Notion of external join in the current select query
<a name="notion_external_join_the_current_select_query_ELTPARAGRAPHE000049"></a>

When calculating a join between two data files ("Parent" file and "Child" path), only the records with a correspondence in the two data files are kept by default. However, the notion of "External join" allows you define a rule to include: 

- the records of "Parent" file without correspondence in the "Child" file.

- the records of "Child" file without correspondence in the "Parent" file.




To define an external join in the current select query:

1. Right click the join and select "Edit join" in the context menu.

2. The description window of the query joins appears.

3. Select the join to modify.

4. Two options are available on this join, allowing you to define an external join ("Include also"). 

5. Select the option(s) corresponding to the desired result.

6. Validate.

### Editing the conditions of a join in the current select query
<a name="editing_the_conditions_join_the_current_select_query_ELTPARAGRAPHE000071"></a>

To edit the conditions of a join in the current select query:

1. Right click the join and select "Edit join" in the context menu. 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Jointure_Requ%EAte%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)


2. The description window of the query joins appears. 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Jointure_Requ%EAte%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif&type=thumb)


3. Select the join to edit.

4. Click the "Edit join conditions" button. The edit window of conditions is displayed.![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Jointure_Requ%EAte%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.gif)


5. You can: 

	- Add a new condition. ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Jointure_Requ%EAte%20-%20HC%20N%B0003%201.gif)


	- Modify a condition. ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Jointure_Requ%EAte%20-%20HC%20N%B0003%202.gif)





### Adding a condition
<a name="adding_condition_ELTPARAGRAPHE000093"></a>

To add a condition: 

1. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Jointure_Requ%EAte%20-%20HC%20N%B0003%201.gif)
. The window for creating a condition is displayed.![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Jointure_Requ%EAte%20-%20HC%20N%B0004.gif)


2. Select the item for which the condition will be created (1). Only the "key" items are proposed.

3. Select the operation to perform in the list (2). 

4. Select the type of element to compare for the operation to perform (3): 

	- the value: this option is selected for a static value in the query.

	- the parameter: this option is selected when passing parameters during the query execution.

	- the item: this option is selected when performiing a comparison with an item found in another query file. Only the "key" items are proposed.




5. Validate. The condition is added to the previous condition. 

6. Don't forget to check the logical sequence of created conditions.

## Limitations and notes
<a name="limitations_and_notes_ELTTEXTE000273"></a>


### Specific joins
<a name="specific_joins_ELTPARAGRAPHE000116"></a>

The joins such as (A Join B on x=y) Join C on y=z are not supported.

To run queries with such joins, you must use [HExecuteQuery](../WDLang4/3044080.md) or [HExecuteSQLQuery](../WDLang4/3044084.md) with the *hQueryWithoutCorrection* constant.

### SQL Server syntax for joins
<a name="sql_server_syntax_for_joins_ELTPARAGRAPHE000133"></a>

The SQL syntax for joins is supported (when editing an SQL query and when running it). To run these queries, you have the ability to use [HExecuteQuery](../WDLang4/3044080.md) or [HExecuteSQLQuery](../WDLang4/3044084.md).
<a name="NOTE3_3"></a>


### Advanced parameters
<a name="advanced_parameters_ELTPARAGRAPHE000146"></a>

By default, the joins use the ISO syntax (INNER JOIN / LEFT OUTER JOIN / RIGHT OUTER JOIN / FULL JOIN). You also have the ability to use the Oracle syntax of joins. However, this syntax compatible with Oracle 7 is not recommended. 

To use the Oracle syntax: 

1. Open the query description window. 

2. Click the "Advanced" button. 

3. In the "Joins" tab, select the requested type of syntax.
