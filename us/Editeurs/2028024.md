## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000307"></a>
By default, only the files found in the "List of setup files" window are installed on the user computers.

The setup editor WDInst gives you the ability to:

- [Install distributable WINDEV tools](#NOTE2_1).

- [Distribute MDAC](#NOTE3_1).

- [Install and configure the ODBC driver](#NOTE4_1).

- [Include an automatic uninstaller](#NOTE5_1).




**Remark**: These options can also be configured in the setup program creation wizard.

**Installing additional elements**
The additional elements to install are managed in WDInst: on the "Tools" tab, in the "Utilities" group, click "WDInst". 
The setup program creation wizard also allows you to install additional elements.

## Installing distributable WINDEV tools
<a name="installing_distributable_windev_tools_ELTTEXTE000331"></a>


### Overview
<a name="overview_ELTPARAGRAPHE000053"></a>

Several WINDEV tools can be freely distributed with your applications:

| Tools | Description |
| --- | --- |
| DplViewer | Used to view duplicates. |
| [ReplicSynchro](../ReplicSynchro/3526550.md) | Allows you to manage the assisted Universal Replication. |
| [WDConver](../WDConver/3512006.md) | Converts external files to HFSQL data files. |
| [WDDebug](../Editeurs/2019021.md) | Used to debug an application remotely |
| [WDLog](../WDJournal/3516012.md) | Saves and restores the data files in HFSQL format and manages the logs. |
| [WDOptimizer](../WDOptimiseur/3519002.md) | Optimizes access to HFSQL data files (reindexing, memo corrections, etc.). |
| [WDReplic](../WDReplic/3520016.md) | Manages data replication between computers that use the same application. |
| [WDSQL](../WDSQL/3521011.md) | Defines a connection and creates SQL queries on this connection. |
| WDTelDiagno | Returns the list of available TAPI lines and specifies the line that will be used by the telephony functions. |
| [WDTrans](../WDTrans/3524005.md) | Used to cancel transactions or to free records in transaction. |


To avoid cluttering up the end user computer, the files required for these tools are installed in "\\Program Files\\Common files\\ PC SOFT\\28.0". The path of the optional tools directory is returned by [SysDir](../WDLang1/3073026.md). For example: SysDir(srCommonProgramFiles)+"\\PC SOFT\\28.0".

If an application shortcut is created in the "Start" menu, the shortcut of each tool installed on the user computer will also be added to the "Start" menu (in the same program group as the application).

The HFSQL optimizer will be installed by default if the application is associated with an HFSQL database.

### To install the distributable WINDEV tools on the user computers:
<a name="install_the_distributable_windev_tools_the_user_computers_ELTPARAGRAPHE000129"></a>

1. Select "Setup settings .. Advanced parameters".

2. Check "Include the optional tools when creating the setup.".

3. Click "Tools" to select the tools to include.

4. Select the tools to include and validate.




**Remark**: If you install a WINDEV tool without using WDInst, the following files must be supplied to the users:

- The executable program of the tool (".EXE" file).

- The WINDEV libraries ("wd280XXX.DLL" files).

- The component files (".WDK" files) located in the "Programs" subdirectory of the WINDEV installation directory.

## Distribute MDAC
<a name="distribute_mdac_ELTTEXTE000361"></a>


### Overview
<a name="overview_ELTPARAGRAPHE000157"></a>

If your application uses a database via OLE DB, the following elements must be installed on the user computers:

- an OLE DB provider ("MSDAORA", "OraOLEDB.Oracle", "SQLOLEDB", ...).

- MDAC (Microsoft Data Access Component) version 2.6 or later.




If MDAC is not installed, only the connection to the OLE DB database will be possible: it will not be possible to read the tables (a message indicates that this interface is not supported).

**Caution**: The distribution license of MDAC specifies that the executable must be downloaded (from Microsoft's website) in order to get the rights to redistribute it with an application. Before performing the operations described in the following paragraphs, you must download the MDAC executable to the current computer.

The MDAC executable can be downloaded from Microsoft's website at the following address (valid at the time of writing this document):: [http://www.microsoft.com/data](http://www.microsoft.com/data)
<a name="NOTE3_2"></a>


### Distributing the MDAC executable to the users
<a name="distributing_the_mdac_executable_the_users_ELTPARAGRAPHE000174"></a>

To distribute the MDAC executable to the users:

1. Select "Setup settings .. HFSQL files".

2. Check "Install MDAC found at the following location".

3. Specify the path of the MDAC executable that was downloaded beforehand.

## Installing and configuring the ODBC driver
<a name="installing_and_configuring_the_odbc_driver_ELTTEXTE000391"></a>


### Overview
<a name="overview_ELTPARAGRAPHE000187"></a>

To handle an HFSQL database from a non-WINDEV application, the ODBC driver on HFSQL must be installed and configured on the user computer. For more details, see [ODBC driver on HFSQL](../WDLang4/3044179.md).

**Remark**: The ODBC driver on HFSQL can only be used to **read and write** in an HFSQL database from a non-WINDEV application.
<a name="NOTE4_2"></a>


### Installing and configuring the ODBC driver
<a name="installing_and_configuring_the_odbc_driver_ELTPARAGRAPHE000199"></a>

To install and configure the ODBC driver:

1. Select "Setup settings .. HFSQL files".

2. Check "Install the ODBC driver for HFSQL".

3. Enter the name used to identify the HFSQL database when using the ODBC driver on HFSQL.

4. Enter the path of the analysis used as ODBC source (.WDD file corresponding to the WINDEV analysis).

## Including an automatic uninstaller
<a name="including_automatic_uninstaller_ELTTEXTE000421"></a>


### Overview
<a name="overview_ELTPARAGRAPHE000213"></a>

To simplify the uninstall process of your application, WDInst allows you to include an uninstaller in the setup program.

In this case, the "uninst.INF" file will be created in the installation directory of the application. This file lists all the application files installed on the current computer.

**Remark**: To uninstall the application, the uninstaller uses an entry in the Registry. The setup editor WDInst allows you to modify this identifier. For more details, see [Modifying the identifier used to uninstall the application](../Editeurs/2028013.md).
<a name="NOTE5_2"></a>


### Uninstalling your application
<a name="uninstalling_your_application_ELTPARAGRAPHE000227"></a>

As for any Windows application that includes an uninstaller, to uninstall an application, you must:

- display the list of programs installed on the current system ("Add/Remove programs" in the control panel).

- select the application in the list of programs.

- click the "Modify/Delete" button.
	The following elements will be deleted:

	- the files listed in the "uninst.INF" file.

	- the entries in the registry created when installing the application.

	- the application shortcuts (on the desktop and in the "Start" menu) if they exist.

	- the data files (".FIC", ".MMO" and ".NDX" files) after user confirmation.

	- the files saved during the different updates (if they exist) after user confirmation.

	- the directories whose files are deleted during the uninstall process.







**Special case**: If the application creates data files in a specific directory (different from the application subdirectories), these data files will not be automatically deleted during the uninstall process.

**Remark**: You have the ability to translate the different messages of the uninstaller. For more details, see [Translating the uninstaller](../Editeurs/2028087.md).

### Including an uninstaller in the setup program
<a name="including_uninstaller_the_setup_program_ELTPARAGRAPHE000254"></a>

To include an uninstaller in the setup program:

1. Select "Setup settings .. End of setup".<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Options%20install_WDINST%20-%20HC%20N%B0005%202.gif)
