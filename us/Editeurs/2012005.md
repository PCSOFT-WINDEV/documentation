## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000085"></a>
.NET is Microsoft's software development platform. This .NET platform simplifies the development of distributed-object applications whose modules communicate via Internet.

This help globally explains how to use the .NET technology in WINDEV. See a specific documentation for more details.

### Creating .NET assemblies
<a name="creating_net_assemblies_ELTPARAGRAPHE000022"></a>

You have the ability to create .NET programs (or .NET assemblies) from a WINDEV application.

These.NET assemblies are directly created from WINDEV classes (with all the benefits from the code editor, the documentation editor, ...).

### Using existing .NET assemblies
<a name="using_existing_net_assemblies_ELTPARAGRAPHE000031"></a>

You can use .NET assemblies (not created with WINDEV) in a WINDEV application or WEBDEV site:

- in a new application: to do so, specify the use of .NET assemblies in the project creation wizard.

- in an existing application: to do so, select the .NET assemblies to use.

The name of the button selected by the user is automatically displayed. <br>- use a .NET control in order to view the Web pages.
