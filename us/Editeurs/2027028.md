## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000119"></a>
The "Debugger trace" shows the messages displayed in the trace window during the last application test.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=VoletTrace.gif)
These messages can correspond to:

- the calls to [Trace](../WDLang1/3013050.md).

- the errors that occurred during the test. The full error text is displayed in the trace window.

- the messages associated with the breakpoints. For more details, see [Managing breakpoints](../Editeurs/2019005.md). 




The context menu of this pane allows you to:

- Clear the trace.

- See the code associated with the current line (you also have the ability to double-click the line in the trace to see the associated code).

- Configure the information listed in the debugger trace:

	- calls to the Trace function,

	- exceptions,

	- non-fatal errors,

	- assertions,

	- control characters in character format (&lt;\\r&gt;&lt;\\n&gt;) or convert them into their value.




- Retrieving the content of a line, exporting the trace content.




**Remarks**: 

- The "Debugger trace" pane shows only the last 1000 elements (1 element corresponds to a call to [Trace](../WDLang1/3013050.md) or to an error).
