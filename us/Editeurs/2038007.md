## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000118"></a>
Checking an element back in the repository is used to make the modified element available to all the users of the Source Code Manager. The element that was modified locally is copied into the reference project on the SCM server.

**Remark**: The elements checked out from the Source Code Manager are bordered by a red line in the project editor.

**To check in an element into the repository**: 

1. Select this element in the "Project explorer" pane.

2. Select "Check in" from the popup menu.




Another possibility: on the "SCM" tab, in the "Current element" group, click "Check in".

**Important**: The style sheet is a specific element of the project. To check in the style sheet, on the "SCM" tab, in the "Other actions" group, expand "Style sheet" and select "Check in the project style sheet".

You can:

- In the "Tasks" tab, specify that the checked-in element corresponds to the execution of a task or to the completion of a task.

- In the "Incidents" tab, specify that the checked-in element corrects an incident.

- In the "Comment" tab, enter a comment about the check-in operation. For example, you can indicate that the window proposes a new menu option.

- Find out the modifications performed on the element ("My modif" button).

- View the properties of the element ("Properties" button).




You can check in the changes made to the element and keep the element checked out ("Keep element checked out" option).

When an element is checked in into the Source Code Manager, it is bordered by a black line in the project editor.

**Remark**: if the checked in element was not modified, a specific screen is displayed by the SCM.
