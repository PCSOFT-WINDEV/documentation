## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000295"></a>
The advanced options of the network setup are used to:

- configure the options for remote control

- modify the conditions for applying the update

- display the help about the new features to the user during the network setup.

- reference the application in the Control Centers. 




By default:

- no help is displayed for the new features.

- the options for remote control are as follows:

	- time interval between each remote control: 5 minutes.

	- message to forbid the connection: "This application was locked by the administrator for an update and it is not available right now."

	- message of imminent shutdown: "This application will be stopped for update. Save your modifications and exit the application."

	- message of forced shutdown: "CAUTION: The application will be stopped for update."

	- message to resume the setup: "The previous update of the application was not ended properly and the application cannot be run. Do you want to perform the update again?".




- the update is automatically installed if no operation is performed by the user during 60 seconds.

## Configuring the options for remote check
<a name="configuring_the_options_for_remote_check_ELTTEXTE000343"></a>


### Overview
<a name="overview_ELTPARAGRAPHE000066"></a>

The remote control of a WINDEV application allows the manager of a network application to manage the automatic shutdown of the application for all the current users.

For more details, see [Principle of remote check](../WDLang1/3013006.md).

**Remark**: The configuration of the control options can be modified by the manager of the application from the [program for remote check of WINDEV executables](../WDAdminExe/2028052.md)  (WDAMINEXE) installed on the server.
<a name="NOTE3_2"></a>
The remote check options are configured in the "Control parameters" tab of the advanced options of the wizard. 

**To configure the options for remote check:**


1. Specify the time interval (in minutes) between each check.

2. Enter the different messages displayed on the end-user computer: 

	- the message used to forbid the connection. 
			This message will be displayed if the users try to connect to the application while the "Connection forbidden" option is checked in "WDADMINEXE".

	- the message for imminent shutdown.
			This message will be displayed if the users are connected to the application and if the "Warning of imminent shutdown" option is checked in "WDADMINEXE".

	- the message for forced shutdown.
			This message will be displayed if the users are connected to the application and if the "Forced shutdown" option is checked in "WDADMINEXE".

	- the message to resume setup.
			This message will be displayed if the users try to reconnect to the application while the setup of the last update failed.







Remark: If no message is entered, the following message will be displayed: "The previous update of the application did not end properly and the application cannot be run. Do you want to restart the update?".

### Important: changing the control options in WDADMINEXE
<a name="important_changing_the_control_options_wdadminexe_ELTPARAGRAPHE000109"></a>

If the remote control options are changed directly in the "WDADMINEXE" administration program, the new values set in the administrator are kept by default. The "Restore default values" link in WDADMINEXE allows you to restore the values specified in the last setup.

## Modifying the conditions for applying the update
<a name="modifying_the_conditions_for_applying_the_update_ELTTEXTE000379"></a>
To inform the users that an application update is available, the following window is displayed when the application is started. ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=FenMiseAJour.gif)
This window allows you to install or not to install the update.

The different options for automatic validation are as follows:

- ***Don't validate the updates automatically***. 
	The user will have to validate the window.
	If the update is mandatory, the user will have to install this update before the application can be used. 
	If the update is optional, the user will have the ability to install the update or to start the application.

- ***Apply the update automatically if it is proposed*** (default option). 
	A click on the "Update" button will be performed at the end of the timeout for "Automatic validation".
	During this time-out, the user has the ability to cancel the update or to start the application if the update is not mandatory.

- ***Apply the update only if it is mandatory***. 
	If the update is mandatory, a click on the "Refresh" button will be performed at the end of the timeout for "Automatic validation". During this timeout, the user has the ability to cancel the update. 
	If the update is optional, a click on the "Ignore" button will be performed at the end of the timeout for "Automatic validation". During this time-out, the user has the ability to install the update.

- ***Cancel the start of the application if the update is mandatory***. 
	A click on the "Cancel" button will be performed at the end of the timeout for "Automatic validation".
	During this time-out, the user has the ability to install the update or to start the application.




**Remark**: Regardless of the runtime language of the setup program, this window will be displayed in French by default. To display this window in a language other than French, you must translate the WDSetup project.
<a name="NOTE4_2"></a>
The conditions for applying the update are configured in the "Automatic update" tab of advanced options of the wizard. 

**To modify the conditions for applying the update**: 

1. Select the option for automatic validation (see above).

2. Specify the time-out (in seconds) after which the information window will be validated or closed (60 seconds by default). 
	Depending on the option for "Automatic update":

	- the update will be automatically installed.

	- the application will be started without modification.

	- the startup of the application will be canceled.







This time-out is ignored if the "Don't validate the updates automatically" option is checked.

The "Parameters for checking the presence of updates" button is used to configure: 

- **the frequency for checking the availability of updates**. 
	By default, the availability of an update on the server is checked whenever the application is started. This check frequency can be configured. It can be performed: 

	- Whenever the application is started. 

	- Every X days. 




- **the interactions with the user when checking the availability of an update**. 
	Whenever it is started, an application installed via a network setup checks whether an update is available on the reference server. 

	- If a more recent version is available on the server, the application update is proposed to the end user. 

	- If the network connection is not found when opening the application, a warning message is displayed by default. 
			This message can be useless for an application used on a mobile device, connected intermittently. In this case, simply select "Silent check: Don't inform the user". 







You have the ability to allow these options to be modified during the setup of the reference version.

The new features of the application can:

- be entered in the window of advanced options for the network setup.

- be saved in a file in text or RTF format.

- correspond to the help file automatically generated during the executable creation. For more details, see [Help about the new features](../Editeurs/2028084.md). 




The help about the new features is configured in the "Help for the new features" tab of the advanced options of the wizard.
