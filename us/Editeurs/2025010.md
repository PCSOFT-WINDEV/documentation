## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000077"></a>
When creating the executable, you have the ability to choose the languages that will be included in the executable. This option enables you to generate a different executable for each language.

**Caution**: if you choose to generate the executable for a single language, don't forget to modify (if necessary) the menu options allowing to change the language.

## Languages of the executable
<a name="languages_the_executable_ELTTEXTE000101"></a>
The current language in WINDEV is proposed by default.

You have the ability to select:

- One of the languages used by the project, 

- All project languages, 

- The current language in the editor.




**Remark**: Selecting a limited number of languages is used to reduce the size of the application library (WDL). The project configurations can also be used to manage the languages. You have the ability to use a project configuration to generate a FR + US library from a project containing 5 languages for example.
