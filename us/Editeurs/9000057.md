### Principle for generating a PHP site with WEBDEV
<a name="principle_for_generating_php_site_with_webdev_ELTPARAGRAPHE000011"></a>

WEBDEV allows you to create PHP sites without prior knowledge. The site is developed in WLanguage like any other WEBDEV site.

You can also enter your PHP code directly.

A syntax and lexical analysis is now available for PHP and JavaScript code.

When generating the pages, the WEBDEV pages and the WLanguage properties are automatically converted into PHP pages.
