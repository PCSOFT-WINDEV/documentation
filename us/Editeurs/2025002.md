## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000204"></a>
Once the development of your WINDEV application is completed (windows, reports, queries, etc.), you can create the corresponding executable file. WINDEV allows you to create the executable file for Windows applications. 

The ".EXE" file can be run directly: there is no need to start the application from WINDEV.

Once the executable file has been created, the application can be deployed on the end-user computers via the setup program. For more details, see [Setup program of a WINDEV application](../Editeurs/2028001.md)

Remark: The executables created with WINDEV can be checked by the Windows App Certification Kit. The Windows App Certification Kit tests and validates whether your application is ready to get certified and published on the Microsoft Store.

### To create a WINDEV executable
<a name="create_windev_executable_ELTPARAGRAPHE000028"></a>

1. Start the executable generation wizard via one of the following methods: 

	- On the "Project" tab, in the "Generation" group, click "Generate". 

	- Expand ![Executable generation](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_generation_exe.gif)
 in the quick access buttons and select "Generate 32-bit Windows executable (.exe)". 




2. Specify the [general options of the executable](../Editeurs/2025006.md) (executable name, icon, etc.).

3. Select:

	- [how to use the library](../Editeurs/2025004.md) (library included in the executable, external library, etc.).

	- the [operating mode of the executable](../Editeurs/2025004.md) (single-instance or multi-instance program).




4. Enter the error message that will be displayed if a programming error occurs. This error message can be written in all the languages supported by the current project.

5. Specify whether the application must send data for the telemetry. 
	Caution: implementing the telemetry in an application requires implementing a telemetry server. For more details, see the following pages: 

	- [Telemetry: Overview](../WDLang1/1410086580.md).

	- [Telemetry: Installing the server](../WDLang1/1410086581.md). 




6. Specify if the executable program will use Patches for updates. In this case, you just have to copy the patch file to the executable directory. For more details, see [Application patch](../Editeurs/2030031.md).

7. Specify the [languages to be included](../Editeurs/2025010.md) in the executable file.

8. Specify [the files to include in the main library](../Editeurs/2025012.md) of the application.

9. If your project uses external components, specify whether they must be included in the executable file.

10. If your application supports the [User Groupware](../Editeurs/2018001.md), specify the [directory in which the user groupware data files will be created](../Editeurs/2025007.md).

11. Specify the [directory in which the data files used by the application will be created](../Editeurs/2025007.md).

12. Specify the executable information available in the "Version" or "Details" tab of the file description in the explorer:

	- [Executable information](../Editeurs/2025008.md) (application description, copyright, etc.).

	- **Signature of the executable**: If the executable must be signed, specify the certificate to use. This certificate must be on the Microsoft Store (more precisely on the user store and not on the computer store). The signature standard used is PKCS7.
			This signature is used to: 

		- make sure that the executable has not been modified since it was generated.

		- display the editor name in the Windows download window. 




13. Specify the [executable version number](../Editeurs/2025008.md).

14. Select the mode for using the [WINDEV framework](../Editeurs/2025003.md) (.DLL files). Specify whether o not the DLLs of the WINDEV framework must be included in the executable. Select the DLLs to be used.

15. If your application is used on Windows Vista (or later), specify whether a [manifest](../Editeurs/2025013.md) must be included in the executable file. In this case, specify the level of privilege that must be managed.

16. Select the [external libraries (".WDL" files) used by the executable program](../Editeurs/2025003.md).

17. Validate the creation of the executable program. Once the executable program is created, WINDEV prompts you to run it.




Remarks: 

- If the executable and the setup procedure are created at the same time, the wizard also allows you to [document the new features](../Editeurs/2028084.md).

- The generation directory can be opened at any time: on the "Home" tab, in the "General" group, expand ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Rep_Projet.gif)
 and select "Browse generation directory".

## Error case
<a name="error_case_ELTTEXTE000252"></a>
If an "Access denied" error occurs during the generation of the executable file, it means that a process is blocking it.

The blocking program must be identified. The programs to be examined are those configured to have an impact on all the files located on the disk (backup, data synchronization, antivirus, etc.). A tool such as "Process Explorer" can help you find the relevant process.
