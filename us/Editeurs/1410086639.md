## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000100"></a>
To use a WEBDEV cluster, it is necessary to distribute the load between the different cluster nodes (each node corresponding to a WEBDEV Application Server). To do so, you must install and use a proxy or a load balancer.

This proxy server (or load balancer) must be implemented before the cluster nodes. It will act as a gateway between the Internet and the WEBDEV cluster. This server will take users to the websites on different cluster nodes.

Remarks: 

- This document does not explain how to install and configure a proxy.  

- PCSCloud platforms allow you to use WEBDEV clusters. A proxy is available and is ready to be used with WEBDEV clusters.

## Generating a proxy configuration example (HAProxy)
<a name="generating_proxy_configuration_example_haproxy_ELTTEXTE000124"></a>
You can manage the different nodes from the "Cluster" tab of the WEBDEV Application Server administrator. 

This tab also allows you to generate a configuration example for an HAProxy server. HAProxy was chosen because it is a free and popular proxy. You can choose a different proxy, use an existing proxy, etc.

To generate a configuration example, click **"Get configuration elements for HAProxy"**. The following window appears:

Caution: To use this example, you must know how to configure HAProxy.

## Proxy and security
<a name="proxy_and_security_ELTTEXTE000148"></a>
The proxy is connected to the WEBDEV cluster nodes via port 80. 

By default, usernames and passwords are sent to the cluster nodes in a readable format. 

The level of security will depend on your infrastructure: 

- If you use a private network (LAN, VPN), risks are very low because the network is not connected to the Internet. 

- If you use public nodes (because you have multiple providers, for example), there are different methods to secure access and data: 

	- Install a proxy on each node and use IP address filtering. This method is recommended. 

	- Install a TLS certificate on each node, to encrypt the data exchanges. This solution requires a different certificate on each node, as the former is associated with the latter.
