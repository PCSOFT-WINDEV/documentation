## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000098"></a>
The flexible modeling editor allows you to easily create a "non-restricting" and "flexible" modeling, entirely included in the environment.

This flexible model allows you to describe an existing or a forthcoming project, and to get a model that "evolves" with your application.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Modelisation1.gif)
 The link with the environment allows the editor to propose choices each time it detects an interaction or a possibility of interaction.

The diagrams are organized in a hierarchical system: they go from general to details, with as many levels as necessary.

The models displayed on the screen are dynamic. For example, if a "window" icon appears in a model, a click performed on this icon will open the window in the window editor of WINDEV or WINDEV Mobile. Similarly, the data files will open the corresponding analysis, ...

Furthermore, when a window is "dropped" from the window editor to the modeling, the icon and the corresponding link are automatically created in the diagram.
