## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000325"></a>
The generation of an application in Universal Windows 10 App mode groups all the project elements (windows, code, etc.) in an archive in order for the application to be deployed on a Windows 10 device and to be distributed.

For more details on how to create a Universal Windows 10 App, see [Developing applications in Universal Windows 10 App mode](../Editeurs/1410086576.md).

### Generating an application in Universal Windows 10 App mode
<a name="generating_application_universal_windows_10_app_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000022"></a>

To generate an application in Universal Windows 10 App mode: 

1. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Ico_Generation_W10.gif)
 in the quick access buttons. The wizard for generating the application in Universal Windows 10 App mode starts.
	Remark: If all the modules required to generate an application in Universal Windows 10 App mode are not installed, the wizard indicates the missing elements. For more details, see [Required configuration](../Editeurs/1410086574.md). 

2. Select the generation mode: 

	- [Generating and deploying the application](#NOTE2_2). 

	- [Generating the application for Windows Store](#NOTE2_3). 






<a name="NOTE2_2"></a>


### Generating and deploying the application
<a name="generating_and_deploying_the_application_ELTPARAGRAPHE000046"></a>

The generation wizard then the deployment wizard are started. 

The different steps of the generation wizard are as follows: 

1. Specify the general information about the application: 

	- Application name,

	- Application description, 

	- Software publisher

	- Copyright. 




2. Go to the next step. 

3. Specify the version number of the application in standard format. This format corresponds to a set of 4 numbers separated by dots. 

	- The first group of 4 digits corresponds to the number of major changes performed in the application.

	- The second group of 4 digits corresponds to the number of minor changes performed in the application.

	- The third group of 4 digits corresponds to the generation number. 
			We advise you to automatically increment this number at each generation. This increment operation is automatically performed if the option "Automatically increment the version at each generation" is checked.

	- The last group of 4 digits corresponds to the number of reviews (branches in the SCM for example).




4. Go to the next step. 

5. Choose the different images associated with the application. By default, WINDEV Mobile generates images to the expected format. You can customize these images or use your own images. 
	The expected images are: 

	- The standard logo of the application for the square tile (150 x 150 pixels)

	- The small logo for the square tile and the list of all applications (44 x 44 pixels)

	- The logo for the square tile (71 x 71 pixels)

	- The logo for the square tile (310 x 310 pixels)

	- The large application logo for the rectangular tile (310 x 150 pixels)

	- The small logo for the task manager, the thumbnails and the notification toasts (30 x 30 pixels)

	- The image of splash screen (620 x 300 pixels)

	- The image of the application displayed in Windows Store (50 x 50 pixels)
			Tip: you have the ability to select an image in the image catalog of WINDEV Mobile. The expected images will be automatically generated from the selected image and the corresponding files will be associated in the wizard. 




6. Go to the next step. 

7. Choose: 

	- the background color of the tile.

	- the display mode of the tile.  




8. Go to the next step.

9. Enter the error message that will be displayed if a programming error occurs. This error message can be typed in all languages supported by the current project. Go to the next step. 

10. Specify whether files must be included in the package. You can include:

	- specific resources.

	- specific images.

	- data files. 




11. Specify the "Write" option: 

	- **If the "Write" option is checked for the files**, these files will be automatically extracted (e.g., files that must be modified by the application). In this case, specify the application directory into which this file must be checked out (data directory by default). 

	- **If the "Write" option is unchecked for the files**, these files can be:

		- used directly (files to read for example: sound files, image files, etc.). These files are included in the application and they will not be extracted. [fResourceDir](../WDLang1/1000020166.md) is used to access these files in read-only mode.  

		- extracted through programming with [fExtractResource](../WDLang1/1000019509.md). 




12. Go to the next step. 

13. If your project contains several languages, specify the languages found in the application. Go to the next step. 

14. Select the features used by the application. 
	Remark: **If you are using features linked to APIs**, the next step allows you to declare the files used by the APIs and their characteristics. 

15. Go to the next step. 

16. The application signature is mandatory. The wizard proposes to generate a certificate or to use an existing certificate. In this last case, all you have to do is select the requested certificate. 
	To generate a new certificate: 

	- Specify the name of certificate to generate. 

	- The next wizard step is used to create the certificate. 

		- Click the "Create the certificate" button. 

		- The Windows explorer displays the created certificate. 

		- In the explorer, right-click to open the context menu of the file and select "Install certificate". The certificate import wizard starts. 

		- In the wizard, select the storage location: "Local computer". Click "Next". 

		- Select "Place all certificates in the following store". 

		- Click the "Browse" button and select the "Trust root certification authorities" store. 

		- Click the "Next" button until the end of wizard. A message is displayed, indicating that the import was successful. 




- In the wizard, check "The certificate was successfully installed" and go to the next step. 

17. The screen for generating the application is displayed. In this screen, you have the ability to declare a "windows.protocol" extension. A "Windows protocol" extension is used to start the application:

	- via a command line (press Windows + R simultaneously and run the interpreter of commands by typing "CMD").

	- from a browser. 
			To declare a "windows.protocol" extension: 

		- Click the "Advanced" button, 

		- In the window that is opened, enter the name that must be given to the protocol. The command line and the URL for the browsers are automatically created.




- For example, if the protocol is named "wdorganizer", the following syntaxes will be generated:

	- for a start in command line: "start wdorganizer:"

	- for a start from a browser: "wdorganizer:"![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=W10_Protocole.gif)

18. Validate the generation of the Universal Windows 10 App application.  

19. The deployment wizard starts and proposes to select the deployment platform: 

	- the local computer. 

	- a phone connected in USB. 

	- a network phone. 
			Remark: The generated application can be installed on a Windows 10 tablet. For more details, see [How to install an application on a tablet](../Editeurs/1410086579.md).
