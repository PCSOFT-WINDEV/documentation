Regardless of the type of site created by WEBDEV (static site or dynamic site), WEBDEV Development version allows your to automatically install the site on the server.

- **If you develop a static site or a PHP site**:
	WDDeploy allows you to deploy your static or PHP site by FTP or by network. To start WWDeploy, go to the "Project" tab, "Generation" group, expand "Deploy site" and select "Generate and deploy site". For more details, see [Help about WDDeploy](../WDDeploie/3533001.md).
	
	




- **If you develop a dynamic site**: 
	To start the setup wizard, go to the "Project" tab, "Generation" group, expand "Deploy site" and select "Generate and deploy site".
	This wizard proposes to:

	1. Create (if necessary) the library of the dynamic site. For more details, see [Options for creating the library](../Editeurs/2028097.md).
			**Reminder**: A  library is a WDL file that contains all the WEBDEV resources: pages, reports, classes, sets of procedures, ... The presence of a library is required for a dynamic site.
			

	2. Choose the type of setup:

		- [Deployment to PCSCloud](../Editeurs/2028107.md) (more details on [http://www.pcscloud.net](http://www.pcscloud.net)). 

		- [Site deployment directly to a remote WEBDEV Application Server or WEBDEV Cluster.](../Editeurs/2028019.md)This setup will be completed using FTP or HTTP.

		- [Creation of a deployment package](../Editeurs/2028089.md).

		- [Setup via physical media](../Editeurs/2028090.md).

		- [Setup by stand-alone physical media](../Editeurs/2028091.md).

		- Setup via a Docker image of the site. 

		- [Deployment of the WEBDEV site via PC SOFT's test hosting service](../Editeurs/2028101.md).









- **If you develop a Webservice**: 
	At the end of the Webservice generation wizard, the deployment of the Webservice is automatically proposed. During the deployment on a WEBDEV application server, the following types of setup are available: 

	- [Deploy the site directly to a remote WEBDEV Application Server or WEBDEV Cluster.](../Editeurs/2028019.md)This setup will be completed using FTP or HTTP.

	- [Deployment to PCSCloud](../Editeurs/2028107.md) (more details on [http://www.pcscloud.net](http://www.pcscloud.net)). 

	- [Creation of a deployment package](../Editeurs/2028089.md).

	- [Setup via physical media](../Editeurs/2028090.md).

	- [Setup by stand-alone physical media](../Editeurs/2028091.md).

	- [Deployment of the Webservice on the local computer](../WDLang3/3086002.md). This option is proposed only if WEBDEV Development version is installed on the current computer.

	- [Deployment of the WEBDEV site via PC SOFT's test hosting service](../Editeurs/2028101.md).
