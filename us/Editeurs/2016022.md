**Remarks**: 

- Make sure that the files used for the fonts are free of rights or that you have a license allowing you to distribute them. 

- If you import a font and create a set of fonts, the files corresponding to this font are copied into the "&lt;Project_name&gt;_WEB\\Styles\\fonts" subdirectory. Therefore, they will be automatically taken into account when installing the site.




**Caution: Set of fonts containing imported fonts:** 
Before using a downloaded font, it must be integrated into a set of similar fonts. 

If the set of fonts contains only the downloadable font, the following case may occur: if the font is not found on the browser: 

- the Times font is displayed by default while the requested font is downloaded. 

- if the font cannot be downloaded, the Times font is still displayed. 




To avoid displaying an unwanted font, it is advisable to create a set of fonts containing the following elements: 

- the fonts to download,

- one or more substitution fonts corresponding to the fonts of main systems,

- one or more fonts corresponding to the most common fonts,

- the associated type of font families. The list of types of font families is as follows: 

	- "cursive": handwritten style,

	- "fantasy": like Impact,

	- "monospace" like Courier,

	- "sans-serif" like Arial,

	- "serif" like Times.





If the first font is not found, the first one found in the list and on the computer will be used. 

**Example**: The following set of fonts is defined: "Open Sans, Segoe UI, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif". If the "Open Sans" font is not found, the "Segoe UI" font will be used, otherwise the Arial or Helvetica font will be used. These fonts are well-know fonts to have correct alternatives. If these two fonts are not found, the first available font without serif will be used.
