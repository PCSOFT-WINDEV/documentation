Your Universal Windows 10 App application is ready to be used. It can now be published on the Windows Store of Microsoft in order to be sold or to be shared with the community. 

The deployment steps are as follows: 

1. [Local certification and certification criteria](#NOTE2_1). 

2. [Creating a Microsoft developer account](#NOTE3_1). 

3. [Submission for the deployment on the store](#NOTE4_1). 
	This step is used to get the identifiers required by the generation.

## Local certification
<a name="local_certification_ELTTEXTE000209"></a>
Before any deployment, the application must be validated on the development computer with the "Windows App Cert Kit". 

This kit can be downloaded from the following address: [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=263703](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=263703). 

**The local certification of the application is performed in several steps**: 

1. Generate the application in WINDEV or WINDEV Mobile. Install this application locally on the development computer. 

2. From the startup screen, start "Windows App Cert Kit". 

3. In the wizard, select "Validate a Windows Store application". 

4. Choose your application. 

5. Click the "Next" button and wait for the end of test. The computer should not be used during the validation. 

6. At the end of the wizard, save the status report in a file. 

7. If the wizard displays "SUCCESS", you can submit the application to the Store. Otherwise, the report will indicate the problems that occurred.

## Creating a Microsoft developer account
<a name="creating_microsoft_developer_account_ELTTEXTE000239"></a>
A Microsoft developer account is required to submit an application. 

Two types of accounts are available, individual or company: 

- The individual developers can submit Windows Store Apps applications only. 

- The company developers can submit Windows Store Apps applications as well as desktop applications. 




The Microsoft site presents the differences between the two types of accounts. 

**To create a developer account**: 

1. Open the Windows Store Apps development center: [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=245786](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=245786). 

2. Connect with your Microsoft account (Live or Hotmail account). If you have no Microsoft account, create one. 

3. Follow the steps of the wizard for creating a developer or individual account. 

	- Choose the type of account: individual or company. 
			**Caution: the choice of the account type is permanent**.

	- Accept the contract. The wizard displays the registration cost. 

	- Confirm the purchase and pay online.
