## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000379"></a>
WINDEV, WINDEV Mobile and WEBDEV propose several dockable panes. These panes give access to several features and/or information. The content of these panes may be adapted to the current editor.

The dockable panes are as follows:

These panes can be:

- ***anchored***: the panes are "attached" to one of the environment sides.
	In this case, to have a larger workspace, the panes can be:

	- temporarily hidden.

	- visible upon request.




- ***floating***: the panes are independent.

## Display a dockable pane
<a name="display_dockable_pane_ELTTEXTE000403"></a>
To display a docked pane: 

- on the "Home" tab, in the "Environment" group, expand "Panes", select "Panes" and then select the pane to be displayed. The icons of the displayed panes are enclosed in a blue border.

- right-click the WINDEV/WINDEV Mobile/WEBDEV ribbon to open the context menu, select "Panes" and then select the pane to be displayed. The icons of the displayed panes are enclosed in a blue border.

- on the "Home" tab, in the "Environment" group, expand "Options" and select "General options of WINDEV/WEBDEV/WINDEV Mobile". In the window that is displayed, in the "Editor" tab, select the panes to display.


**Caution**: displaying some panes (the "Code" pane for example) may trigger the automatic display of additional panes.

### Operating mode of docked panes
<a name="operating_mode_docked_panes_ELTPARAGRAPHE000220"></a>

The docked panes (attached to one of the editor sides) can be:

- always visible (default feature).

- visible upon request: click the "Pin" (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_cadenas.gif)
 icon of each pane). The pane will be displayed only when a side of the editor is hovered by the mouse cursor (side where the pane is docked).

### Displaying the panes according to the screen configuration
<a name="displaying_the_panes_according_the_screen_configuration_ELTPARAGRAPHE000232"></a>

Depending on the screen configuration used, the panes can be:

- grouped on a single screen with the development environment (single-screen configuration).

- grouped on a second screen (multi-screen configuration).

- grouped on the right of the screen (configuration for wide screen).

## Moving a dockable pane
<a name="moving_dockable_pane_ELTTEXTE000439"></a>
To move a dockable pane:

1. Click the title bar of the pane.

2. Keep the left mouse button down and move the pane. To help you during these moves, a "positioning grid" is automatically displayed: ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=PalettePosition.GIF)





**Remarks**: 

- When the pane is moved near one of the sides (left, right or bottom) of the editor, the pane is automatically resized and docked to the side.

- The size and position of the pane are stored when the pane is closed. When this pane is re-opened, the pane will be displayed according to the stored size and position. If a pane is positioned on the second screen, this pane will be automatically repositioned on the main screen when it is re-opened on a computer equipped with a single screen.

- Once the different docked panes have been positioned, you can save these configurations. For more details, see [Environment configuration](../Editeurs/9000065.md).

- The management of multi-screen and wide screens automatically adapts the size and position of the panes according to the resolution and to the position of the screens. .

## Resize a dockable pane
<a name="resize_dockable_pane_ELTTEXTE000463"></a>
To resize a "dockable" pane:

1. Position the mouse cursor on one of the pane sides: the cursor turns into a double arrow.

2. Keep the left mouse button down and resize the pane.




**Remarks**:

- When a pane is docked, you have the ability to modify the width and/or the height of this pane.

- The size and position of the pane are stored when the pane is closed. When this pane is re-opened, the pane will be displayed according to the stored size and position. If a pane is positioned on the second screen, this pane will be automatically repositioned on the main screen when it is re-opened on a computer equipped with a single screen.

- Once the different panes have been positioned, you have the ability to store these configurations. For more details, see [Environment configuration](../Editeurs/9000065.md).

## Hide a dockable pane
<a name="hide_dockable_pane_ELTTEXTE000487"></a>
To temporarily hide all docked panes, press Ctrl + W. This option allows you to get a bigger workspace.

**Remarks**: 

- To only hide the panes docked on the bottom side of editor, press Ctrl + Q.

- To only display the title bar of a pane, click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=IconeReduitFenAncrable.gif)
. A second click restores the pane to its initial size.

- on the "Home" tab, in the "Environment" group, expand "Panes", select "Panes" and then select the pane to be closed. The icons of the displayed panes are enclosed in a blue border.

- right-click the WINDEV/WINDEV Mobile/WEBDEV ribbon to open the context menu, select "Panes" and then select the pane to be closed. The icons of the displayed panes are enclosed in a blue border.

- on the "Home" tab, in the "Environment" group, expand "Options" and select "General options of WINDEV/WEBDEV/WINDEV Mobile". In the window that is displayed, in the "Editor" tab, de-select the pane to close.

- click the ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=IconerFermerFenAncrable.gif)
 icon found in the title bar of each pane.




**Remark**: The size and position of the pane are stored when the pane is closed. When this pane is re-opened, the pane will be displayed according to the stored size and position. If a pane is positioned on the second screen, this pane will be automatically repositioned on the main screen when it is re-opened on a computer equipped with a single screen.
