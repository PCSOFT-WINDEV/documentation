## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000129"></a>
WEBDEV allows you to create a PHP site that handles data files:

- in **MySQL** format. This data can be handled by the SQL functions of WLanguage or by the HFSQL functions of WLanguage. A MySQL database is required.

- **via ODBC**. This data can be handled by the SQL functions of WLanguage. You have the ability to handle a data source in HFSQL Classic or HFSQL Client/Server format defined in the ODBC administrator.

- in **PostgreSQL** format. This data can be handled by the SQL functions of WLanguage or by the HFSQL functions of WLanguage. A PostgreSQL database is required and the php_pgsql extension must be enabled in the php.ini file.

- in **Oracle** format. This data can be handled by the SQL functions of WLanguage or by the HFSQL functions of WLanguage. An Oracle database is required, the php_oci8 extension must be enabled in the php.ini file and the Oracle client layer must be found on the server.

## Handling the MySQL, Oracle or PostgreSQL data files
<a name="handling_the_mysql_oracle_postgresql_data_files_ELTTEXTE000202"></a>


### To handle the MySQL, Oracle or PostgreSQL data files in PHP with the HFSQL functions:
<a name="handle_the_mysql_oracle_postgresql_data_files_php_with_the_hfsql_functions_ELTPARAGRAPHE000031"></a>

The type of the data files described in the project analysis must correspond to the targeted database. The connection to the server is described in the analysis.

If this condition is fulfilled, the data files can be directly handled by the HFSQL functions available in PHP.

The browsing Table controls created in the editor are directly linked to the data files described in the data model editor.

### Remarks
<a name="remarks_ELTPARAGRAPHE000042"></a>

- The use of HFSQL functions on queries with the PHP/MySQL access requires a MySQL server version 4.1 or later.

- When reading records in a query (with [HReadFirst](../WDLang4/3044051.md) and [HReadNext](../WDLang4/3044037.md), for example), the query may executed multiple times.

- The names of the files and items found in the database must contain no accented characters and no space characters.

- Using queries with parameters: If the SQL code of the query was not entirely generated by the query editor, the name of the query parameters must have the following format: {paramX} where X is the number of the parameter in the order of appearance in the query.
	Example: SELECT LastName, FirstName FROM Customer WHERE LastName={Param1} AND FirstName={Param2}

## Handling data files via ODBC
<a name="handling_data_files_via_odbc_ELTTEXTE000640"></a>
To handle data files via ODBC:

1. Define an ODBC data source.
	To create a data source on HFSQL Classic or Client/Server files, see [ODBC driver on HFSQL Classic and Client/Server.](../WDLang4/3044179.md)
	Remark: To use the SQL functions in PHP, you must define a "system" ODBC data source (and not a "user" ODBC data source).

2. Use [SQLConnect](../WDLang4/3072005.md) to connect to the database. In this case, the type of the database is "ODBC".

3. Use the SQL functions to handle your data.
