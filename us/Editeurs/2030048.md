## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000103"></a>
Recent computers (servers and desktop computers) are now equipped with "64-bit" operating systems. 

The main difference between a "32-bit" and a "64-bit" system is as follows: in "64-bit", the applications and the system no longer have memory allocation limitations. 

In "32-bit" configurations the operating system is limited to 4 GB, while in "64-bit", there is nearly no limit (the limit is set to 18 billions GB). 

To help you develop 64-bit sites and applications, WINDEV and WEBDEV propose: 

- A framework available in 32 bits and in 64 bits

- The WEBDEV Application Server available in 32 bits and in 64 bits

- The HFSQL Client/Server server available in 32 bits and in 64 bits. For more details, see [HFSQL Client/Server](../WDLang4/3044306.md).

### To create a 64-bit application
<a name="create_64bit_application_ELTPARAGRAPHE000035"></a>

1. [Develop your 64-bit application](../Editeurs/2030063.md). A 32-bit application can be changed into a 64-bit application.

2. [Deploy your application](../Editeurs/2030065.md).
