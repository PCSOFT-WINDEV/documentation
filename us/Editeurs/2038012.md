## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000100"></a>
When creating an executable, a library or a component, the SCM proposes to check in the last version of the elements found in the SCM. Therefore, the executable, the component or the library will contain the most updated elements.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=GDS_Exe.gif)
The different options are as follows:

- **Check in the checked-out elements**: This option is used to check in all the elements that have been checked out by the current developer. The elements will be made available to the other developers. This check-in operation is performed after the creation. This option is recommended.

- **Get the latest version of the project elements**: This option allows you to get the latest version of all project elements. The operation is performed before creating the requested element.
	**Caution**: This option may trigger compilation errors or differences of behavior. We advise you to run the test of the project before generating the element.

- **Get the latest version of the project elements and check in the checked-out elements**: This option is used to:

	- check in all the elements that have been checked out by the current developer. The elements will be made available to the other developers. This check-in operation is performed after the creation.

	- get the latest version of all the project elements. The operation is performed before creating the requested element.
			**Caution**: This option may trigger compilation errors or differences of behavior. We advise you to run the test of the project before generating the element.




- **No action**:  This option enables you to create the requested element (executable, library, component, ...) with the project elements found locally. No check-in operation or synchronization is performed.




By default, the executable, the library and the component are generated with the project elements currently found on the local computer.

## Implementation
<a name="implementation_ELTTEXTE000124"></a>
The synchronization is automatically proposed by default when creating the executable.

If you check "Always perform this choice without asking me", you will have the ability to re-enable this window from the description window of the project:

1. Open the project description window: on the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, click "Description".

2. Display the "SCM" tab.

3. Select "Propose to check in and to get the latest version of the elements when generating executables, libraries, components, ...".

4. Validate.
