## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000071"></a>
A **database** is an organized collection of data for a particular purpose (e.g., manage orders). This data is organized and stored in a database so users can use it easily.

We use databases everyday: a simple address book is a database.

The address book allows you to store names, addresses, phone numbers, etc. The alphabetical index allows you to easily find a person.

In a computerized database, we find the same concepts as in the address book:

- the information stored corresponds to the **items**.

- the groups of information correspond to the **data files**,

- the indexes are created from the sort items (called **keys**).
