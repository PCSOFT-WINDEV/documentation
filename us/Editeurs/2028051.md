## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000186"></a>
The site parameters are used to configure the options for connecting to the site as soon as it is installed. These parameters can be modified if necessary:

- by the deployment administrator found on the server.

- by the remote administrator, that can be used by the site manager.

## Configuring the site
<a name="configuring_the_site_ELTTEXTE000210"></a><br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=param_site.gif)
The deployment parameters are as follows:

- **Activate site immediately after setup**: 
	The site will be available once it has been installed: you will be able to connect by using the proper address. 
	If this option is not checked, the site can be activated via the remote administrator.

- **Perform a backup of the site before the update**: 
	For an update, allows you to save the existing site. 
	This backup copy should have a name and can be a full backup or contain only the deployed files.
	This backup can be reactivated from the remote WEBDEV Administrator. 

- **Schedule deployment for a later date**: 
	In this case, the deployment will be performed at the specified date and time. For more details, see [Immediate or delayed setup](#NOTE2_2). 




The site parameters are as follows: 

- **Disconnect idle users after**: (when deploying a dynamic WEBDEV site only)
	Maximum connection time allowed without any action performed by the user. 
	When this time is exceeded, the Web user is automatically disconnected and an error message is displayed.

- **Duration of AWP contexts**: (when deploying an AWP WEBDEV site only)
	Validity period of AWP contexts for the site. As soon as the specified duration is over and if no new request was performed, the context file is deleted. For more details on AWP contexts, see [AWP: Managing contexts](../WDChamp/3539060.md).

- **Maximum task duration**: 
	Maximum duration for running the scheduled or delayed tasks. If the tasks used exceed this duration, they will be automatically stopped. For more details, see [WEBDEV: Scheduled tasks and delayed tasks](../WDLang2/1000019455.md). 

- **Maximum number of simultaneous connections to the site**: 
	Corresponds to the maximum number of simultaneous connections allowed for this site. For example, if this number is set to 250, 250 Web users will be able to connect to this site at the same time.

- **Maximum number of cached sessions for the site**: 
	Number of cached sessions for the site. 
	For more details, see [Pre-launched sessions](../WDLang2/1000019485.md).

- **Maximum number of connections per user**: (when deploying a dynamic WEBDEV site only)
	Corresponds to the maximum number of simultaneous connections to the site allowed for the same Web user. 
	If this parameter is set to zero, the user who tries to connect simultaneously to the same site will be automatically disconnected then reconnected. 
	If this parameter is greater than zero, an error message will be automatically displayed after the x simultaneous connections.




During a deployment on several servers simultaneously, you have the ability to configure the site parameters for each profile. The following elements are taken into account: 

- Maximum number of simultaneous connections to the site.

- Maximum number of connections per user.

- Disconnect the idle users since.

### Immediate setup: case of a setup on a remote WEBDEV application server
<a name="immediate_setup_case_setup_remote_webdev_application_server_ELTPARAGRAPHE000101"></a>

By default, WEBDEV proposes an **immediate setup** of the site. In this case, the files are immediately transfered by FTP to the server and installed in the directory defined on the server.

In some case, a **delayed setup** may be useful. For example:

- installing a large site: a delayed setup allows you to check whether all the files are installed (in immediate setup, the setup can be stopped according to the time-out defined for the CGI.

- updating a site: a delayed setup allows you to perform your setup at night, in order to reduce the number of connected Web users.

- updating several sites that share an analysis with automatic data modification: a delayed update allows you to update all the sites at the same time in order to take the automatic modification of data files into account.




During a delayed setup, the files are immediately transmitted by FTP but they are actually installed only when the specified date and time are reached on the server.

**Caution**: the specified date and time are the ones of the server. Make sure that they are valid.



## Site security
<a name="site_security_ELTTEXTE000240"></a>
Then, the wizard allows you to define the parameters for site security: 

- **Changing IP while navigating**: If this option is not allowed, the IP address associated with the session cannot change while navigating. This is used to protect against "session hijack" attacks (attack that consists in pretending to be a legitimate user connected to the server). 

- **Access to the AWP context identifiers from JavaScript**: In an AWP site, the site context is stored on the server. The identifier of this context is sent and stored in the browser via a cookie. If this option is not allowed, the cookies used will be "HTTPOnly" cookies, that cannot be read from JavaScript code. This mode protects against XSS attacks (Cross-Site scripting). 
	By default, the access to the AWP context identifiers is not allowed from JavaScript. 






## Generating site statistics
<a name="generating_site_statistics_ELTTEXTE000264"></a>
Then, the wizard allows you to implement the statistical files of the site. These files are exploited by WDStatistic to find out the site traffic or the most visited pages for example.

You can modify the directory of the statistical file or you can choose not to generate these files by unchecking "Generate the statistical files for this site". The directory of the statistical files is always relative in relation to the data directory.

For more details, see [WDStatistics](../WDStatistique/3536004.md).
During a deployment on several servers simultaneously, you have the ability to configure the statistical files for each profile.
