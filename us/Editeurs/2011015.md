To check a CDM:

1. On the "CDM" tab, in the "Analysis" group, click "Check CDM".

2. A window listing the errors and/or the warning is displayed. These errors/warnings are triggered by:

	- the inconsistencies found in the CDM.

	- the standard specified by the user in the "Details" tab of the CDM description ("Model information" in the context menu of the data model editor).<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=OptionsMCD.gif&type=thumb)





3. To print this list, click the "Print" button.




**Remark**: When [generating the LDM from the CDM](../Editeurs/2011020.md), the CDM is automatically checked. If a problem occurs, a window listing the errors and/or the warnings is displayed.

- If only warnings are displayed, the generation of LDM from CDM can continue by clicking the "Close" button.

- If at least one error is displayed, the generation of LDM from CDM is stopped. The "Close" button is used to go back to the editor to correct the CDM.
