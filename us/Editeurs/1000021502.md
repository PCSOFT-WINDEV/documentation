## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000095"></a>
Let's see a simple and illustrated example about the use of MVP to create a Table window with its linked form. This example is using a single file. 

<a name="NOTE2"></a>
<a name="NOTE2_1"></a>


## Principle
<a name="principle_ELTTEXTE000119"></a>
Unlike the classic programming mode, the Table control is linked to a variable instead of a data file. 

Similarly, the form controls are not linked to items but to variables. 

It is using the "Binding" concept.

### The Table window
<a name="the_table_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000025"></a>

In this example, the "Table" window allows you to view a list of contacts.

The possible actions are: 

- Create a contact. 

- Delete a contact.

### The Form window

In this example, the "Form" window is used to create and modify a contact.

The possible actions are: 

- Validate the input. 

- Cancel the input.
