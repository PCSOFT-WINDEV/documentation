Remark: If the "Display all the revisions" option is unchecked, intermediate check-ins will not be displayed, thus providing an even more concise view.

You can: 

- **Change the branch color**: This option allows you to change the color associated with the branch. In the color selector that appears, select the desired color and confirm.

- **Change the branch description**: This option allows you to change the description associated with the branch. In the window that is displayed, specify the new description and validate.
