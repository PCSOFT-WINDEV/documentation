## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000142"></a>
The test of a single page allows you to run the current page in WEBDEV.

This allows you to run the test of your project from a given page or to check the operating mode of a page as soon as it is fully developed.

### Running the test of current static page
<a name="running_the_test_current_static_page_ELTPARAGRAPHE000020"></a>

To test the current static page from the editor, click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_Go_Page_bl.gif)
 in the quick access buttons (or press F9). The editor is automatically minimized and the page is displayed in the default browser.

**Tip**: To select the browser used when running the page test, click the test icon of the page. The arrow on the right expands a menu allowing you to choose the browser that will be used for test.

You can also select the default browser in the [WEBDEV options](../Editeurs/2036001.md).

**When a static page test is started**, the following events are executed:

- "Loading" the current page (browser code). 

- "Entry in the control" of the first control of the current page (if this control has an associated event "Entry in the control") (browser code).




During the test, all page features can be run. You will have the ability to open other pages for example.
Remark: The last test run (window, query, report, ...) can be re-run from any project element via "GO .. Re-run the last test" found in the quick access buttons.

### Stopping the page test

There are multiple methods to stop the test:

- 1st method: Close the site whose test is currently run. WEBDEV displays the editor open when the test was started.

- 2nd method: Go back to the editor with the taskbar (or press Alt + Tab) and confirm the end of the test. WEBDEV displays the editor open when the test was started.
