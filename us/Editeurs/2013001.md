## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000200"></a>
Autocompletion is available for WLanguage commands, procedures, variables, data files, items of data files, windows, controls, types of variables, etc.

This Autocomplete functionality reduces the risk of typing errors and saves a lot of time: no need to search for the exact name of a global variable or control, it is automatically suggested!

The automatic completion is used to:

- ***complete the current input*** by proposing a list of possible values (function name, property name, etc.). All the values proposed in the list contain the word currently typed. 
	The content of the list is refreshed whenever a modification is performed.
	For example, when typing "OKC", all functions, controls, constants and code snippets, ... containing these characters is proposed. ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=completion.gif)
 **Note**: The autocomplete functionality is also available when you change a function that you already entered in the code editor. 
	Example: if you want to replace "**HReadFirst**" with "**HReadSeekFirst**": when you start typing "Seek" between "Read" and "First", the autocomplete feature automatically shows "HReadSeekFirst". When you select the new function, the old function is automatically replaced.  

- ***suggest the value of the possible parameters*** according to the WLanguage function used.
	For example, when using [HRead](../WDLang4/3044047.md), the first expected parameter corresponds to the name of a data file. The automatic completion will only propose the data files of the analysis associated with the current project. ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=completion2.gif)


- ***select the combinations of constants for a parameter***. 
	Simply select the options you want (using the arrow keys) and confirm your choice by pressing the Space key.. 
	All selected options are automatically integrated into the code during validation..
	Remark: The constants are separated in different colored areas used to identify the constants that can be combined (or not) between themselves (two constants found in a colored area with a picker cannot be selected at the same time). ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Completion_cst.gif)


- ***start the code wizards***. These wizards allow you to enter the different parameters of the function by answering simple questions. 
	The &lt;Xxx wizard&gt; option indicates that a wizard is available. To start the wizard, select this option.![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=AssistantCode.gif)


- ***propose the different available extension attributes*** on the current line of code.
	An extension attribute corresponds to a directive passed to the compiler. These attributes are powerful and practical. To get the list of extension attributes available on the current element, simply type "&lt;".  ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Completion_Attributs%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)

	For more details on the available extension attributes, see [List of extension attributes](../Motscles/1511025.md). 




**Remarks**: 

- To use one of the proposals, simply: 

	1. Move through the list using the keyboard arrows. 

	2. Validate the selection: 

		- with the Enter key.

		- with the Tab key.




- The drop-down lists can be resized.

- **If your procedure or function uses a project element (window, page, report, etc.)**, you can get the list of the desired elements via the automatic completion. To do so, add an attribute with a specific extension into the declaration of function or procedure parameters. For more details, see [Parameters of a function or procedure](../Motscles/1513001.md). 

- **If you are using a Data Source variable**, all you have to do is add an attribute with a specific extension to associate it with an existing data file (or query). In this case, the automatic completion will allow you to access the items directly. For more details, see [Data Source variable](../WDLang4/1514053.md). 

- The code editor also provides assisted input (parameter hinting, etc.). For more details, see [Code editor: Assisted input](../Editeurs/2013009.md).

### Enabling the automatic completion
<a name="enabling_the_automatic_completion_ELTPARAGRAPHE000093"></a>

To enable the automatic completion in your project:

1. Open the options of code editor: on the "Home" tab, in the "Environment" group, expand "Options" and select "Options of the code editor".

2. Check "Enable the assisted input after an idle time of" and specify the time after which the automatic completion should be proposed.




**Remark**: To disable the automatic completion, uncheck this option.

The list of WLanguage keywords proposed by the automatic completion is available in English or in French.

To modify the code language used by the automatic completion:

1. Open the options of code editor: on the "Home" tab, in the "Environment" group, expand "Options" and select "Options of the code editor".

2. Select the language of the code in the "Code language: " combo box.
