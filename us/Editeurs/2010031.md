## Highlighting selected elements
<a name="highlighting_selected_elements_ELTTEXTE000411"></a>
In the code editor, whenever the cursor is positioned on an identifier (variable, procedure, data file, etc.), all uses of this identifier are highlighted in the current code. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Code_Surbrillance_Element.gif)


Similarly, if the mouse cursor is positioned on a block statement (IF, THEN, ELSE, FOR, END, LOOP, WHEN EXCEPTION ON, etc.), the different elements of this block are highlighted. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Code_Surbrillance_bloc.gif)


Remark: When the secondary keywords (ELSE, END, etc.) are hovered by the mouse cursor, the associate condition is displayed in a tooltip. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Code_BulleSi.gif)


Finally, the current line can be easily identified via dots used to highlight the current line. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Code_surlignage_ligne.gif)


All these options can be modified if necessary. 

**To modify the highlighting options**:

1. Display the configuration window of code editor: on the "Home" tab, in the "Environment" group, expand "Options" and select "Options of the code editor".

2. In the "Code" tab, select the following options if necessary: 

	- "Highlight the blocks of code (IF/THEN/END, brackets, ...)".

	- "Highlight the current line".

	- "Highlight the declaration and the uses of the variable".




3. Validate. 




**Remark**: All the colors used to highlight the elements can be configured in the "Coloring" tab of the configuration window of code editor.

## Finding code
<a name="finding_code_ELTTEXTE000435"></a>
**To find an element in the code editor**, all you have to do is use the "Find/Replace" pane, enabled via Ctrl + F.

**To perform an immediate search on an element found in the code editor**, all you have to do is press Ctrl F3 on an element of code editor (the "Find/Replace" pane being displayed). 

Pressing Ctrl + F3: 

- fills the search control with the word onto which the cursor is positioned. 

- triggers the search. 

- highlights in the code all the occurrences found and positions on the first occurrence. 




The F3 and Shift + F3 keys allow you to navigate from an occurrence to another one via the keyboard. 


### Search in a selection
<a name="search_selection_ELTPARAGRAPHE000109"></a>

The code editor allows you to perform a search (and a replacement) in a selection. 

If a selection exceeding one line is active, the search is automatically performed in this selection. 

When performing a search in a selection, the searched word is highlighted in the code. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Code_Recherche_Selection.gif)
F3 and Shift + F3 allow you to go from one occurrence to another.  


### Finding and accessing an event
<a name="finding_and_accessing_event_ELTPARAGRAPHE000120"></a>

The code editor allows you to find and access an event of the current element: window, page, report, ... 

1. On the "Code" tab, in the "Navigation" group, type the event you want to find. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Code_Recherche_Traitement.gif)
