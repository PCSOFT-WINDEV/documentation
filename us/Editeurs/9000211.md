## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000125"></a>
In WINDEV Mobile, you can create applications that adapt to all devices, by setting anchors on the controls.

To deal with specific cases, you may need to to create a layout for a given phone or tablet.

How to determine if a window will be displayed as expected on a given device?

How to determine if the current anchors work as expected both in portrait and landscape mode on the same device?

To solve these and many other problems, you can use WINDEV Mobile's Device panel.

This panel allows you to simulate the behavior of your windows (anchors and layouts) on a given set of devices.
