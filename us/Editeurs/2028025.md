## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000176"></a>
If your applications must be installed in several countries, the setup editor WDInst gives you the ability to generate a multilingual setup.

The languages supported by the setup program will be proposed to the user when installing the application.

## Configuring a multilingual setup
<a name="configuring_multilingual_setup_ELTTEXTE000200"></a>
The configuration of a multilingual setup is performed in the setup editor WDInst. To start WDInst, go to the "Tools" tab, "Utilities" group and click "WDInst".

The setup program creation wizard can also be used to configure a multilingual setup.

The "French" and "American" languages are proposed by default to the user when the application is installed. To keep this management mode, the following elements must be configured for these two languages:

- a license, if a license is displayed at the beginning of the application setup.

- a "Readme" file, if a "Readme" file is displayed at the end of the application setup.

- a layout.

- slides (WDInst only).

- the captions of shortcuts and the groups of programs (WDInst only).

## Managing several languages in the setup program
<a name="managing_several_languages_the_setup_program_ELTTEXTE000224"></a>
To support several languages in the setup program: 

1. Select "Setup settings .. Style". The languages already supported by the setup program are listed in the "Languages available during setup" area.

2. Click the "Add" button to add new languages.
	**Remark**: Once a new language is added, you must configure the characteristics specific to this language (layout options, slides, ...). These languages must also be supported by the "WDSetup" project. For more details, see [WDSetup: Managing additional languages](../Editeurs/2028037.md). 

3. Click "Delete" to delete the language selected in "Languages available for setup".
	**Caution**: All the characteristics defined for the deleted language (layout options, slides, ...) will be lost.

## Configuring a multilingual setup program

Once the different languages supported by the setup program have been selected, you must:

- [select a license specific to each language](../Editeurs/2028053.md) if necessary.

- [select a "Readme" file specific to each language](../Editeurs/2028053.md) if necessary..

- [configure a layout specific to each language](../Editeurs/2028030.md).

- [select the slides specific to each language](../Editeurs/2028030.md).

- [enter the caption of shortcuts](../Editeurs/2028004.md) (created during the setup) [in all the available languages and specify the group of programs into which the shortcuts must be created](../Editeurs/2028004.md).
	The caption of shortcuts will be created in the runtime language of setup program.

- customize the "WDSetup" project if the setup program must support languages other than American and French (languages proposed by default).

- If the setup includes an uninstaller, translate the [uninstaller options](../Editeurs/2028087.md) in the different languages. 




In order for the setup program to support additional languages, the "WDSetup" project must be customized before creating the setup program. This project (supplied with the full examples of WINDEV) corresponds to the standard setup program of the WINDEV applications. For more details, see [Using a custom setup program](../Editeurs/2028037.md).

### Application installed on the network
<a name="application_installed_the_network_ELTPARAGRAPHE000104"></a>

When updating an application installed on the network, a window is displayed when the application is started from an end-user computer. This window informs the user that an upgraded version of the application is available. This window allows you to install or not to install the update.

## Starting the multilingual application
<a name="starting_the_multilingual_application_ELTTEXTE000278"></a>
By default, a multilingual application is run in the main language of the project ("Main language" in the "Languages" tab of the project description).

**To start the application in the runtime language of the setup program**: 

- retrieve the runtime language of the setup program and save this language in a ".INI" file or in the registry of the setup computer. This operation can be automatically performed during the setup. For more details, see [Managing the registry and the ".INI" files during setup](../Editeurs/2028013.md).

- use [Nation](../WDLang1/3054014.md) to change the language the application uses at runtime.




For more details, see [Developing multilingual applications](../WDLang1/3054008.md).
