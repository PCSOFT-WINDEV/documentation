## Files to install
<a name="files_install_ELTTEXTE000307"></a>


### Overview
<a name="overview_ELTPARAGRAPHE000025"></a>

One of the main steps when creating a setup is the selection of the files to install.

By default, the setup program automatically selects all the files found in the EXE subdirectory of your project excluding the data files (".FIC", ".NDX", ".MMO"). The selected files will be installed on the user computers.

The files displayed in green correspond to the new files to install since the last setup generation.

**To add files to install**, click the "Add" button and select the files to add.

**To delete files from the setup**, select the file and click the "Remove" button.

**To configure the setup properties of each file**, select the file and click the "Properties" button. You have the ability to create a shortcut with a command line for one or more files, manage the file versions when updating the application, manage the automatic data modification, ... For more details, see [File properties](#NOTE4_1).



### Setup with automatic update
<a name="setup_with_automatic_update_ELTPARAGRAPHE000044"></a>

In a setup with automatic update, the setup program creation wizard lets you choose where each file should be installed. Each file can be installed:

- on the server only (data files shared by all the users for example).

- on the user computers only (the application executable for example).

- both on the server and on the user computers (a ".INI" file for example, used to configure the application installed on the server with the default parameters and the applications installed on the user computers with parameters specific to the users).




To specify the computers on which each one of the files must be installed, all you have to do is check the box:

- "Server" for the files to install on the server. These files will be installed when the setup program is run on the server.

- "Client" for the files to install on the user computers. These files will be installed when the setup program is run on the user computers.

- "Server" and "Client" for the files to install both on the server and on the user computers.

## WINDEV framework
<a name="windev_framework_ELTTEXTE000343"></a>


### Setup mode of the framework
<a name="setup_mode_the_framework_ELTPARAGRAPHE000063"></a>

The WINDEV framework corresponds to all the WINDEV DLLs. By default, the WINDEV framework is included in the setup program. All the framework elements required for the application to operate are automatically installed with the application.

To create "smaller" setup programs, you can:

- download the WINDEV framework from the PC SOFT site. 

- install no framework. The framework installed on the user computers will be used. This framework will be downloaded if it does not exist.

**Remarks**: 

- The WINDEV framework can be downloaded even if your application uses renamed DLLs.

- The framework is downloaded using HTTPS. If the download via HTTPS fails, the download is completed via FTP. 



<a name="NOTE3_2"></a>


### Downloading the framework
<a name="downloading_the_framework_ELTPARAGRAPHE000087"></a>

The option "Download the WINDEV framework from the PC SOFT site" is used to create a smaller setup.

If your application contains executables that use a renamed common framework, you can specify the framework installation directory (next step of the wizard). By default, the setup directory is "&lt;srCommonProgramFiles&gt;\\ &lt;Company Name&gt; \\Framework\\".

The setup program will use the Internet connection of the current computer, and the following window will be displayed: 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Fichier_a_installer%20-%20HC%20N%B0008.gif&type=thumb)


Whenever the executable is run, all the files of the WINDEV framework will be automatically downloaded from the PC SOFT site. The version of the downloaded framework will correspond to the WINDEV version that was used to create the executable.![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Install_Framework2.gif)


**Remark**: To translate the different elements found in this window, click the "FTP settings" button and the "Translate" button.
<a name="NOTE3_3"></a>


### Framework location
<a name="framework_location_ELTPARAGRAPHE000104"></a>

By default, the common framework is installed in the "&lt;Installation directory of elements common to several applications&gt;\\PC SOFT\\&lt;WINDEV version&gt;\\Framework" directory,

Where:

- "&lt;Installation directory of elements common to several applications&gt;" corresponds to the directory returned by [SysDir](../WDLang1/3073026.md) (with the *srCommonProgramFiles* constant).

- "&lt;WINDEV version&gt;" is the version of WINDEV with which the executable was created (e.g., "28.0" if the executable was created with WINDEV 28).

## Properties of files to install
<a name="properties_files_install_ELTTEXTE000379"></a>


### "Path" tab
<a name="path_tab_ELTPARAGRAPHE000125"></a>

This tab is used to specify: 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Fichier_a_installer%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif&type=thumb)


- the installation directory of the file. The following shortcuts can be used:

	- **&lt;SetupDir&gt;**: setup directory chosen by the user during the setup

	- **&lt;SetupDrive&gt;**: drive of the setup directory chosen by the user during the setup.

	- **&lt;WinDir&gt;**: Windows directory of user computers

	- **&lt;SetupFile&gt;**: setup directory of data files. The setup program creation wizard allows you to configure this directory. For more details, see [Configuring the directory of data files](../Editeurs/2028086.md).

	- **&lt;srProgramFiles&gt;**: "Program Files" directory of the user computers.




- the name of the file installed. By default, the file has the same name. However, a different name can be given to the file during the setup.



<a name="NOTE4_2"></a>


### "Shortcuts" tab
<a name="shortcuts_tab_ELTPARAGRAPHE000145"></a>

This tab is used to create for the selected file:

- a shortcut in the "Start" menu

- and/or a shortcut on the desktop.

- and/or shortcut in the quick launch bar.





![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Fichier_a_installer%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif&type=thumb)


To create a shortcut: 

1. Select the type of shortcut to create.

2. Enter the caption of the shortcut in each language supported by the setup program.

3. Enter the group of programs where the shortcut must be created.
	**Remark**: This group of programs will be created if it does not exist on the user computer.

4. Specify (if necessary) the parameters of the shortcut. The execution of this shortcut will start a command line. 
	For example, the command line: "C:\\MyDirectory\\MyApplication.EXE /Login = Bill" contains:

	- the full path of the file associated with the shortcut.
			In our example: "C:\\MyDirectory\\MyApplication.EXE".

	- the parameters of the shortcut.
			In our example: "/Login = Bill".







**Remark**: By default, for each executable installed, a shortcut will be created:

- in the "Start" menu of the setup computer.

- on the desktop of setup computer.



<a name="NOTE4_3"></a>


### "Version" tab
<a name="version_tab_ELTPARAGRAPHE000181"></a>By default, when updating an application, if files with the same name already exist in the installation directory, these files are replaced (even if the replaced files are more recent than the installed files). No warning window is displayed to confirm these replacements.

![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Fichier_a_installer%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.gif&type=thumb)


To manage the collisions:

- To install the selected file even if a more recent file with the same name is already found in the setup directory, check "Replace the file even if it is more recent".

- To avoid installing the selected files if a file with the same name is found in the setup directory, check "Don't install if the file already exists".

- To ask the user to confirm whether the selected files must be replaced or not, check "Confirm the replacement of the file".

- To rename the existing file, check "Rename the replaced file with the name below", and enter the name and the extension of the replaced file. For example: MyImage_Bak.GIF.

### "Options" tab
<a name="options_tab_ELTPARAGRAPHE000196"></a>

This tab is used to define the setup options and the compression options of the files as well as the group to which the file is associated.

For more details on compression options, see [WDInst - Configuring the characteristics of the files to install](../Editeurs/2028033.md).

For more details on groups, see [WDInst - Group of files](../Editeurs/2028010.md)

### "HFSQL" tab (for the executables and the data files only)
<a name="hfsql_tab_for_the_executables_and_the_data_files_only_ELTPARAGRAPHE000212"></a>

This tab is used to:

- specify whether the automatic data modification is managed.

- manage the existence of files in Hyper File 5.5 format.




If the selected file is an index, you have the ability to remove the index from the setup and to rebuild it automatically during the setup.
