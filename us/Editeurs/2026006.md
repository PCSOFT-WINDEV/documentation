## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000279"></a>
The tab order of the window controls or page controls describes the order in which the controls receive focus in a window when the user presses the [Tab] key. By default, the tab order corresponds to the order in which the controls were created.

The tab order is taken into account for the controls managed by the [Tabulation] key. You have the ability to define whether a control is managed by the [Tabulation] key:

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) in the "UI" tab of the description window of each window control.

**Remarks**: 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) If "Define the tab order automatically each time the window is modified" is checked, the tab order of the controls will be automatically recalculated: 

	- when adding a control to the window, 

	- when moving a control in the window. 


The tabulation order is always correct regardless of the modification performed in the window.
