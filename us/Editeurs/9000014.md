## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000160"></a>
WINDEV can be used to generate windows for a Java application.

The Java application can then benefit from the user friendliness, the automated tests and the layout of the WINDEV windows. Windows and controls are used in Java "style", via specialized classes and methods for each window and for each control.

The "Javadoc" is supplied (in the "Help\\Javadoc" directory of WINDEV).

More specifically, you have the ability to generate the Eclipse project. Indeed, the call to the WINDEV environment can be included in the Eclipse menus. A plug-in is supplied with WINDEV.

## Generating the Java sources of the project
<a name="generating_the_java_sources_the_project_ELTTEXTE000184"></a>
When generating the Java sources of the project, the following elements are generated:

- an archive (.jar) containing the project elements and the WLanguage code.

- a source file (.java) for each project window. These files are generated in the src directory of the EXE directory.




If "Generate an Eclipse project" is selected, the .project and .classpath files are also generated.

### Generating the Java sources of the project
<a name="generating_the_java_sources_the_project_ELTPARAGRAPHE000036"></a>

To generate the Java sources of the project: 

1. Depending on the current project configuration: 

	- If the current project configuration corresponds to the Java archive, on the "Project" pane, in the "Generation" group, click "Generate".

	- If the current project configuration does not correspond to the Java archive, use the quick access buttons: ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_generation_java.gif)





2. Select "Use the project windows from your own Java source files". Check "Generate the Eclipse project" if necessary. Go to the next screen.

3. Go to the next screen.

4. Specify the name of the archive and its description. Go to the next screen.

5. Specify whether the WINDEV framework for Java must be included in the archive. Go to the next screen.

6. Specify the other files that must be included in the ".jar" archive. You can select the JDBC drivers used to access a database for example. Go to the next screen.

7. Specify:

	- the command of the Java compiler to use. To customize this parameter (if several compilers are installed on the computer for example), select "Custom". In this screen, you can also specify the command line that will be used (see the documentation about the compiler for more details).

	- the command for creating the archive. The "Custom" option allows you to define the tool that will be used to create the archive. You can also specify the command line that will be used (for more details, see the documentation of the compiler) and the content of archive manifest. 

	- the command for including other archives. The "Custom" option allows you to define the tool that will be used to extract the archive as well as its command line.




8. The ".jar" archive is created. The corresponding file was created in the "EXE" directory of project. This file will be used by the Eclipse project.




**Remark**: To start the Java application once the Java sources have been generated, you must either import the project into Eclipse and run this project from Eclipse, or compile and run the content of the scr directory found at the root of the EXE directory.

### Installing the "Eclipse" plug-in
<a name="installing_the_eclipse_plugin_ELTPARAGRAPHE000071"></a>

To install the "Eclipse" plug-in:

1. Run the WDEclipsePlugin.zip file found in the "\\Program\\Data" directory of WINDEV.

2. Unzip the files of WDEclipsePlugin.zip in the setup directory of the "Eclipse" software.

3. Restart the "Eclipse" software.  

4. In the "WINDEV .. Preferences" menu, specify the path of the executable corresponding to WINDEV. This gives you the ability you to directly open your WINDEV projects from the Eclipse software.

### Using a WINDEV project with Eclipse
<a name="using_windev_project_with_eclipse_ELTPARAGRAPHE000083"></a>

To use a WINDEV project with Eclipse:

1. In Eclipse, select "File .. Import .. Existing project into workspace".

2. Click "Next".

3. Select the "Exe" directory of the WINDEV project to import (once the necessary files have been generated).

4. Select the project to import and validate.




In the Eclipse software, the project appears in the "Package Explorer" view.

From the "Package Explorer", you have the ability to directly start the WINDEV project via the popup menu of the project.
