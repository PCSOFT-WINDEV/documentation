## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000100"></a>
A use case diagram is used to view the behavior of a system in such way that:

- the user can understand how to use each element.

- the developer can implement these elements.




For example, the behavior of a cell phone can be described via a use case diagram.

## Elements of use case diagram
<a name="elements_use_case_diagram_ELTTEXTE000124"></a>
A use case diagram includes the following elements:

- **Actor**: represents the role of the users that interact with the application. For example, a person who works in a bank as a loan manager. If they have an account in the same bank, they will also play the role of customer.

- **Use case**: describes a sequence of actions performed by the application. For example, place an order, enter an invoice, create a new customer entry, etc, ...
	A use case describes the actions performed by an application but it does not specify how the application performs these actions.

- **Relationship**: describes the behavior of an actor with a use case. Three types of relationships are available:

	- **Association**: Structural relationship between two linked elements.

	- **Dependency**: Indicates that one element uses or depends on another element. For example, a bank customer may get cash from an ATM. In this case, the Get Cash action depends on the Customer.
			To withdraw money, the Customer must enter a PIN number. In this case, the Get Cash action depends on the Password Input.![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=UML_Cas_utilisation2%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)


	- **Generalization**: Relationship in which elements are organized based on a hierarchy.
			For example:
			- there are two types of Customer actor: Individual Customer or Enterprise Customer.
			- there are two ways to verify the user's identity: a password or a fingerprint. ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=UML_Cas_utilisation3%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)

- ***Package***: divides and organizes the diagram representation (in the same way that directories organize files). Each package can contain actors and use cases.
