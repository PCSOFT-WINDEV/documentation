	From version <B>24</B>, it is no longer possible to create semi-dynamic pages. Only semi-dynamic pages created with a previous version are available.

## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000214"></a>
The test of a single page allows you to run the current page in WEBDEV. This allows you to run the test of your project from a given page or to check the operating mode of a page as soon as it is fully developed.

Reminder: A semi-dynamic page is used to generate static pages that contain data. Before running the test of a semi-dynamic page, you must generate the corresponding static HTML pages.

## How to?
<a name="how_ELTTEXTE000238"></a>


### Running the test of the current semi-dynamic page in the editor
<a name="running_the_test_the_current_semidynamic_page_the_editor_ELTPARAGRAPHE000023"></a>

To run the test of the current semi-dynamic page in the editor:

1. Check whether the data files used are found in the directory of the files used for test (see the Notes).

2. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_Go_Page.gif) in the quick access buttons (or press F9).
	**Tip**: To select the browser used when running the page test, click the test icon of the page. The arrow on the right expands a menu allowing you to choose the browser that will be used for test. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=GO_PAGE_WB.gif)
 The choice of the default browser can also be performed in the [WEBDEV options](../Editeurs/2036001.md).

3. Validate (if necessary) the generation of the corresponding HTML pages.
	Reminder: The following codes are run when the semi-dynamic pages are generated:

	- Declaring the global variables of pages.

	- Initializing pages.




4. The editor is automatically minimized and the page is run.

### Running the test of a sequence of semi-dynamic pages
<a name="running_the_test_sequence_semidynamic_pages_ELTPARAGRAPHE000067"></a>

To run the test of a sequence of semi-dynamic pages:

1. Check whether the data files used are found in the directory of the files used for test (see the Notes).

2. Start the tool for generating the static pages: on the "Tools" tab, in the "Web utilities" group, click "WDGenPage".

3. Select the semi-dynamic page to generate.

4. Click the "Generate" button.
	The following codes are run when the semi-dynamic pages are generated:

	- Declaring the global variables of the page

	- Initializing the page




5. When the generation is over, select the page whose test must be run and click [Run the test]. You can run the test of the first generated static page. The editor is automatically minimized and the page is displayed in a browser.




During the test of a semi-dynamic page, the following processes are run:

- loading the first page (browser code)

- entering the first control of first page (if this control has an entry process) (browser code)




During the test, all page features can be run. You will have the ability to open other pages for example.

Remark: The last test run (window, query, report, ...) can be re-run from any project element via "GO .. Re-run the last test" found in the quick access buttons.

### Stopping the test of a semi-dynamic page
<a name="stopping_the_test_semidynamic_page_ELTPARAGRAPHE000107"></a>

Several methods can be used to stop the test:

- 1st method: Close the site whose test is currently run. WEBDEV displays the editor used at the beginning of the test.
	If the test was run from WDGenPage, you must exit from this tool.

- 2nd method: Go back to the editor with the taskbar (or Alt + Tab) and confirm that the test must be stopped. WEBDEV displays the editor used at the beginning of the test.

## Notes
<a name="notes_ELTTEXTE000274"></a>


### Directory of files used for test
<a name="directory_files_used_for_test_ELTPARAGRAPHE000121"></a>

To configure the data files used when running the site test in the editor:

1. Open the project description: on the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, click "Description".

2. In the "File" tab, select the location of the test files:

	- Current directory: The data files will be in the project EXE subdirectory.

	- Specific directory: The data files will be found in the specified directory.






<a name="NOTE3_2"></a>


### Generation codes
<a name="generation_codes_ELTPARAGRAPHE000139"></a>

Two generation codes are available in a semi-dynamic page. These codes are server codes and they are used to enter the information required for the generation.

For example:

- If the base file of the page (or the analysis) is password-protected, the password can be specified in the generation code.

- If the base file of the page is a query with parameters, the parameters expected by the query can be specified in this code.

- You also have the ability to call a class in this code.



<a name="NOTE3_3"></a>


### Managing passwords (analysis or file)
<a name="managing_passwords_analysis_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000152"></a>

No password is requested during the test of the page, regardless of whether the page is associated with an analysis protected at runtime or with a password-protected data file.

The necessary passwords must be specified by programming in the initialization code of the project (if it exists) or in the initialization code of the global variables of the semi-dynamic page.

- If the page uses a data file from a password-protected analysis, the password must be specified with [HOpenAnalysis](../WDLang4/3044106.md).

- If the page uses one or more password-protected data files, the password must be specified with [HPass](../WDLang4/3044108.md).




If the passwords are not specified, an error occurs when generating the page.
