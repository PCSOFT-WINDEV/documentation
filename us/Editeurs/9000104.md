## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000207"></a>
UI compilation errors indicate the possible problems detected in your interfaces whenever a window, a page or a report is saved or whenever the project is recompiled.

UI compilation errors are also available on reports.
By default, UI compilation errors are enabled for each new project.
