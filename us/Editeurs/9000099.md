### Creating an Android project with WINDEV Mobile
<a name="creating_android_project_with_windev_mobile_ELTPARAGRAPHE000037"></a>

To create an Android project with WINDEV Mobile: 

1. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_nouveau.gif)
 in the quick access buttons. 

	- The new element window appears: click "Project". 

	- The project creation wizard starts.




2. Choose the type of project to create: "Android or iOS application". Go to the next step of the wizard. 

3. Select the platform of the project you want to create. You can create: 

	- a Android/iOS cross-platform project: this project already contains both Android and iOS platforms and can be run on either platform. 

	- an Android-only project: this project will only contain the Android platform. 

	- an iOS-only project: this project will only contain the iOS platform. 


 To create an Android project, select "Android only".. Go to the next step of the wizard.

4. Specify whether the new project should be blank or based on an example. 
	Remark: If the project is based on an example, select the example to use. 

5. Go to the next step of the wizard.

6. The wizard proposes to choose the type of Android devices affected by the project: 

	- Generate an application for phones and tablets.

	- Generate an application for phones only.

	- Generate an application for tablets only.

	- Generate an application for a specific device.




7. **If your application is intended to operate on several Android devices** (phones with different sizes or with different resolutions), we advise you to use one of the first three options. In this case, WINDEV Mobile proposes the smallest resolution to create the windows of the application. Using anchors will allow the application to operate on all the devices. 

8. **If your application is intended to operate on a single type of device**, the next wizard screen allows you to select the precise model.  

9. Go to the next step. 

10. Choose the name and location of your project. You have the ability to enter a short description of the project. Go to the next step. 

11. Add (if necessary) design documents to the project. Go to the next step.

12. Specify whether this project must be included in the [Source Code Manager (SCM)](../Editeurs/2038001.md). The Source Code Manager simplifies teamwork and it can also be useful if you are working on your own. Go to the next step.

13. Indicate if you want to use the code style. The code style corresponds to a programming standard that can be applied to the entire application. This standard is used to prefix the different project elements, variables, etc, ... For more details, see [Code style](../Editeurs/9000074.md). Go to the next step.

14. Select the **style book** used if necessary. This style book will be proposed by default when creating a window and applied to all new controls. This option can be modified in the project description window ("Style" tab). Go to the next step.

15. Select: 

	- the **supported languages**. These languages will be proposed by default as soon as an option of an element (control, window, ...) can be translated. 

	- the **default language at runtime**. This language will be used to view the project at runtime. To select the default language, open the context menu of requested language and select "Default language". 




16. Go to the next step of the wizard. 

17. Specify whether the project must use **a database**.
	If so, your project can use an existing or a new database. If you use a new database, a database creation wizard starts automatically once the project has been created.

18. Validate. The created project becomes the current project.




**Remarks**: 

- If you have requested:

	- to use the SCM, [the wizard for adding projects into a repository](../Editeurs/2038002.md) is automatically started.

	- to create a database, [the corresponding wizard](../Editeurs/2011011.md) is automatically started.




- All the available skin templates can be used with an Android application.

- All the skin templates apply the holographic theme from Android 5. 
	Remark: To use the "Material Design" theme, in the "General" tab of the  description of the Android configuration, check "Apply the Material Design theme to the native controls and to the Info/Error/Dialog windows (requires Android 5.0 or later)".

### Fonts used in an Android project
<a name="fonts_used_android_project_ELTPARAGRAPHE000108"></a>

By default, Android projects use Droid (Droid Sans, Droid Sans Mono and Droid Serif) and Roboto fonts in the editor. These fonts are automatically installed along with WINDEV Mobile on the development computer.

**Using native Android/iOS fonts at runtime**
The following fonts can be used:

- Droid Sans -> all Android versions

- Droid Sans Mono-> all Android versions

- Droid Serif -> all Android versions

- Roboto -> from Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich, api level 14)

- Roboto Condensed -> from Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean, api level 16)

- Roboto Light -> from Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean, api level 16)

- Roboto Thin -> from Android 4.2 (Jelly Bean MR1, api level 17)




You can choose other fonts installed on the development computer when defining the style of a control. 

If the device does not support the specified font at runtime, a substitution font will be used (Droid Sans or Roboto from Android 4.0). This can lead to display problems. 

Remark: If a custom font is used in the project, but has not yet been integrated, a UI error is displayed. 

To use specific fonts (in the editor and at runtime): 

1. Open the project description window: on the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, click "Description".

2. In the "Advanced" tab, click the "Project fonts" button. 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Police_perso_WM%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)


3. In the window that is displayed, add the requested fonts ("Add" button used to add files in 'TTF" or "OTF" format). The files corresponding to the font will be copied to the "Fonts" subdirectory of the project. 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Police_perso_WM%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif&type=thumb)

	**CAUTION**: You must have the necessary rights to distribute the selected fonts. 

4. Validate the different windows. The selected fonts will be available in the window editor, integrated into the Android and iOS applications and deployed. These fonts are also available in the report editor. Make sure that the added fonts support the charset used in your application and that they are redistributable. 




When selecting a font in the control style, the embedded fonts will appear both as a font available for the platform and as a custom font.

### Analysis of an Android project
<a name="analysis_android_project_ELTPARAGRAPHE000117"></a>

When creating an analysis for an Android project, you have the ability to use: 

- an HFSQL Classic or Client/Server database. 

- an "SQLite" database. It is the default database found on the Android operating system. The Native Connector to this database is included in WINDEV Mobile. 




When using an SQLite database, WINDEV Mobile helps you describe a connection to an SQLite database by specifying:

- A name and a description for the connection (the name is used in programming with functions such as [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md)).

- The advanced parameters of the connection:

	- The name of the file containing the database (in SQLite, the entire database is contained in a single file whose extension is.db in most cases).

	- The directory containing the database.







**Remarks**: 

- In an SQLite database, each data file should contain an automatic identifier (strongly recommended).

- The Native Connector for SQLite is available for WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile applications.

- For more details, see [Android application: Using and sharing data](../Editeurs/9000123.md).

## Testing an Android project
<a name="testing_android_project_ELTTEXTE000376"></a>
Several test modes are available for Android applications:

- [Project test (Go) in the WINDEV Mobile simulator](#NOTE3_2). 

- [Project test (Go) on the Android emulator: the emulator is supplied with the Android SDK](#NOTE3_3).

- [Project test (Go) on the device](#NOTE3_4).




**Remark**: To run the test of an application, this application must be generated beforehand. For more details, see [Generating an Android application](../Editeurs/9000109.md).
<a name="NOTE3_2"></a>


### Project test (Go) in the simulator directly
<a name="project_test_the_simulator_directly_ELTPARAGRAPHE000171"></a>

This test starts a WINDEV Mobile test window in which the application for Android is run. 

This test allows you to use the debugger. 

However, several differences can be noticed compared to a real execution. Indeed, the simulation uses the PC and not the Android device. 

Remark: During the project test (GO), a first project window must be defined. 
If the application is available for phones and tablets, a first window can be defined for the phones and another one can be defined for the tablets. 
<a name="NOTE3_3"></a>


### Project test (Go) in the Android emulator directly
<a name="project_test_the_android_emulator_directly_ELTPARAGRAPHE000188"></a>

The Android emulator is supplied with the Android SDK. To use an emulator, you must first create it in Android Studio (refer to the Android Studio documentation for more details). If the emulator has been created, it will automatically appear in the list of available devices for testing via the "GO" option. 

**Remarks**: 

- The emulator may take a long time to start. It is recommended not to close the emulator between 2 project tests. 

- The debugger is not attached to the application. The breakpoints are ignored.

- This type of test does not take the speed of the phone into account. The test takes the speed of the development computer into account. 

- Some WLanguage functions are not available in the emulator. The documentation of the different functions indicates whether the function can be used in the emulator. The functions fail when they are not available.  



<a name="NOTE3_4"></a>


### Project test (Go) on the device directly
<a name="project_test_the_device_directly_ELTPARAGRAPHE000204"></a>

To run this test, the specific drivers must be installed and the phone must be configured (for more details, see [Preparing the Android phone to run tests](../Editeurs/9000117.md)). 

Then, the Android executable is copied onto the phone connected to the PC and run. 

**Remark**: The debugger is not attached to the application. The breakpoints are ignored.
