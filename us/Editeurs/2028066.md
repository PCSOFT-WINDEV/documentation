## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000257"></a>
The setup editor WDInst is used to manage the files to install:

- [View the list of files](#NOTE2_1),

- [Add one or more files](#NOTE3_1),

- [Delete one or more files](#NOTE4_1).




The files to install are managed in the setup editor WDInst. To start WDInst, go to the "Tools" tab, "Utilities" group and click "WDInst".

Unlike the wizard for creating the setup program, WDInst proposes an advanced management of the files to install.

## Viewing the list of files to install
<a name="viewing_the_list_files_install_ELTTEXTE000281"></a>
The files to install can be viewed in the "List of setup files" window of WDInst.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Parametrer_caract_installation_fichier%20-%20HC%20N%B0001%201.gif&type=thumb)

<a name="NOTE2_2"></a>
Two types of files are displayed in this list:

- *** Individual files***. The file is defined by its full name (name and extension) on the development computer. This file will be included in the setup program (if it is found in the source directory during the generation).

- ***Generic files***. The name of the file contains wildcard characters (\*,?). All the files found in the source directory and corresponding to this filter will be included in the setup program during the generation.




For example:<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=TypeFichier.gif)
To view the files associated with a [group of files](../Editeurs/2028010.md), select the desired group in the "Displayed group" combo box.

### Sort the list of files to install
<a name="sort_the_list_files_install_ELTPARAGRAPHE000065"></a>

### Modifying the destination directory of a file found in the list of files to install
<a name="modifying_the_destination_directory_file_found_the_list_files_install_ELTPARAGRAPHE000072"></a>

The destination directory corresponds to the directory in which the file will be installed.

To define the destination directory, the following keywords can be used:

- **&lt;SetupDir&gt;**: setup directory chosen by the user during the setup.

- **&lt;SetupDrive&gt;**: drive of the setup directory chosen by the user during the setup.

- **&lt;SetupFile&gt;**: setup directory of data files. WDInst is used to configure this directory. For more details, see [Configuring the directory of data files](../Editeurs/2028017.md).

- **&lt;WinDir&gt;**: Windows directory of user computers

- **&lt;SysDir&gt;**: system directory.

- **&lt;RefDir&gt;**: reference directory for the setups with automatic update only.




For example: "&lt;SetupDir&gt;\\MyDirectory".

To modify the destination directory of a file found in the list of files to install:

1. Select the desired file.

2. Click the "Destination directory" column.

3. Enter the new destination directory.
