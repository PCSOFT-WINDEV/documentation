The guide is a powerful search engine included in WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile, allowing you to search for the referenced documents regarding a topic.

For example, a search performed on the "ATM card" words will return the different help pages, wizards, components, supercontrols or examples.

This help page explains how to:

- Display the guide.

- Perform a search in the guide.

- Use a guide element.




Furthermore, the guide can be entirely customized: you have the ability to add your own keywords and documents into this database. For more details, see [Customizing the guide](../Editeurs/2033002.md).
