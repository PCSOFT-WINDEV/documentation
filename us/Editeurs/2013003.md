### Automatically translating the WLanguage code into French

Automatically translating the WLanguage code into French:

1. From a code window: on the "Code" tab, in the "Languages" group, expand "Convert code" and select "Translate into French".

2. Specify the scope of the translation:

	- **Current code**: only the code being edited (where the cursor is located) is translated.

	- **Current element**: all the codes associated with the current file in the code editor are translated (for example, all the codes of the window, controls and menus associated with the window).

	- **The entire code displayed in the active code window**: all the codes displayed in the current code window will be translated.

	- **The entire project**: all the codes of all the project elements.




3. Validate. The translation is completed.




**Remarks**: 

- To translate the code from French into English, on the "Code" tab, in the "Languages" group, expand "Convert code" and select "Translate into English". The other steps are identical.

- If multiple lines of code are selected, only the selected lines will be translated.

To translate a WLanguage code during a copy/paste operation (between two WINDEV projects that use different languages for example):

1. Open the options of code editor: on the "Home" tab, in the "Environment" group, expand "Options" and select "Options of the code editor".

2. In the "Code" tab, check "Convert the code to" and select the translation language.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Coller-Code.gif)
