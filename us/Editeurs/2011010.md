## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000236"></a>
The analysis is used to define the structure of the data files used by the project.

You can describe in the analysis:  

- [a new data file.](#NOTE2_1)

- [a preset data file, provided with WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile.](#NOTE2_2)

- [a data file imported from an external database](../Editeurs/2011025.md) (also called "Third-party database").

- [a data file imported from an earlier WINDEV version](../Editeurs/2011025.md).

- [an ISAM HFSQL data file imported via the Windows File Explorer](../Editeurs/2011025.md).




**Remark**: To modify the description of a data file (or the description of its items): 

- Select the data file in the data model editor. 

- Select one of the following options from the popup menu: 

	- "Data file description".

	- "Description of items".







**Reminder**: In a WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile application, the "LDM" and "Analysis" terms are interchangeably used to define the structure of the database associated with a project.

For more details on how to handle a data file or item in the data model editor, see [Operations on a data file](../Editeurs/2011007.md) and [Operations on an item](../Editeurs/2011009.md).

## Adding a new data file

### Creating a new data file
<a name="creating_new_data_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000053"></a>

To create a new data file: 

1. On the "Analysis" tab, in the "Creation" group, click "New file". The data file creation wizard starts.

2. Select "Create a new data file description". Go to the next step.

3. Specify:

	- the ***logical file name***. This name will be used to handle the data file.

	- the ***caption*** that briefly describes the file subject.

	- the ***representation of a record*** in the data file. This representation makes the questions asked when describing the links easier to understand. This option must be preceded by an indefinite article (A or AN).

	- whether the data file includes an ***"Automatic identifier" item***. The value of this item is unique for each record and it is automatically calculated by the HFSQL engine.
			You can use: 

		- an 8-byte ID. This type of identifier is mandatory for the replication of HFSQL servers. 

		- a 4-byte ID. 




- an automatic UUID (128 bits). In this case, the identifier of each record corresponds to a 128-bit UUID (the UUID provides a unique non-sequential identifier). 

- an automatic UUID (256 bits). In this case, the identifier of each record corresponds to a 256-bit UUID (the UUID provides a unique non-sequential identifier).

4. In the next step, specify the ***type of database*** associated with the data file. Depending on the type selected, this data file will be handled by the HFSQL engine, an OLE DB driver or a Native Connector (SQL Server, Oracle, etc.).
	If the type of database used does not correspond to HFSQL Classic (Network or Single-user), the wizard asks for the characteristics of connection to the database.

5. The new data file becomes the current data file. The description window of the data file items opens automatically. It allows you to describe the file items.

### Importing a preset description of data file
<a name="importing_preset_description_data_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000099"></a>

To import a preset file description: 

1. On the "Analysis" tab, in the "Creation" group, click "New file". The data file creation wizard starts.

2. Select the option "Select a description among the preset data files".

3. Choose the preset data file(s) to create. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Analyse_Fichierpredef.gif)
The wizard also proposes associated data files that can be added as links.

4. For each data file, select the items to keep. These items can be modified later.

5. The preset data files are automatically inserted into the current analysis. The links between preset files are automatically established.

## Color for the descriptions of data files
<a name="color_for_the_descriptions_data_files_ELTTEXTE000296"></a>
The following colors are used to quickly identify the types of data files in the data model editor: 

- Blue for the data files coming from a Native Connector.

- Orange for HFSQL Client/Server data files.

- Brown for HFSQL Classic data files.

- Green for ODBC data files. 

- Gray for Hyper File 5.5 data files.

## Security of an HFSQL data file
<a name="security_hfsql_data_file_ELTTEXTE000320"></a>
To ensure the security of an HFSQL data file: 

1. Open the file description: 

	- Select the data file in the data model editor. 

	- In the context menu, select "Data file description".




2. In the "Details" tab: 

	- Enable the encryption option for the data file, indexes, memos. Several encryption modes are available. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Base_HFSQLCS_Securite%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)
The "Automatic (RC5 16 rounds if password)" option is selected by default when a data file is created. This option is used to automatically encrypt the data file if a password is defined by [HPass](../WDLang4/3044108.md) on the data file.

	- Enable the "Enable a high-security level " option.
			Remark: This option is selected by default when creating a data file. This option allows you to request the password at each automatic modification of the data file.




3. Generate the analysis. 

4. Specify a password for the data file with [HPass](../WDLang4/3044108.md). 

5. Encrypt the connection to the database in the connections described in the analysis, or programmatically with the [Encryption](../Proprietes/2512102.md) property.




Remark: Advanced Encryption Standard (128-bit, 192-bit and 256-bit AES algorithm with OFB): 

- If the data file is encrypted using the AES algorithm, you need to use the same method to encrypt memos and indexes. 

- If there is encryption that uses the AES algorithm, the option "Enable a high-security level " is automatically applied.
