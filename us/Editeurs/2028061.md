To make the setup of your application more user friendly, the setup editor allows you to customize the interface of the setup program. These options appear in the skin template steps. 

Two types of customization are available for the interface:

- [customizing the interface for a standard setup or for a network setup](#NOTE2_1).

- [customizing the interface for a compact setup](#NOTE3_1). 




**Remark**: The customization of the interface may differ according to the runtime language of the setup program.

### Overview
<a name="overview_ELTPARAGRAPHE000151"></a>

By default, the setup program is a window that shows the various setup options. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Installation_WD_defaut%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif&type=thumb)<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Installation_WD_defaut%20-%20HC%20N%B0004.gif&type=thumb)


To customize your setup program, you can:

- display a window background image. 

- use a background window behind the setup window . This window can contain: 

	- a text or a logo.

	- a gradient or a background image.

To customize the setup program window:

<a name="using_background_window_the_setup_program_ELTPARAGRAPHE000195"></a>

You can use a background window behind the setup window. 

To customize the background window of the setup program : 

1. In "Title and logo", select the language for which the interface should be customized.

2. Enter the title of the setup program. By default, this title corresponds to name of the application. This title will appear in the title bar of the setup program window. 

3. Click the "Logo" button.

4. Configure the interface of the setup program.




**By default, the setup wizard does not use a background window.**

To get all the options, select "Display setup background image".
