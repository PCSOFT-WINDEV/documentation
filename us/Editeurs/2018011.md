## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000113"></a>
An application that uses the user groupware can be used with a HyperFileSQL database in Client/Server mode.

In order for an application that uses the User Groupware to operate in Client/Server mode, you must:

- convert the existing application into Client/Server mode. For more details, see [Client/Server](../WDLang4/3044306.md).

- configure the User Groupware in order to use the data files found on the server. These operations are presented in this help page.

To convert the data files of user groupware into Client/Server mode: 

1. The User Groupware must not use the "Automatic start" mode in your application.
	Make sure that "Automatic run" is unchecked in the window for configuring the user groupware ("Workshop .. Configure the user groupware").

2. In the initialization code of the project, use [gpwOpenConnection](../WDLang6/3041007.md) to describe the connection to the HyperFileSQL Client/Server database.

3. If the data files specific to the user groupware exist (GPWUser, GPWUserConfiguration, GPWConfiguration, GPWElement Configuration, GPWElement), copy these data files onto the server.

4. Call [gpwOpen](../WDLang6/3041002.md) to specify the positioning of the data files used to manage the rights as well as the data files used to identify the users. The directories must be specified in relation to the server directory.
