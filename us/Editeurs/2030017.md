## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000119"></a>
For each project element (windows, reports, ...), the total time spent is calculated:

- for all the project contributors, 

- for each project contributor.




This time management enables you to run statistics on the duration of a project development, and to easily find out what are the most time consuming parts of your project.

### Calculating durations
<a name="calculating_durations_ELTPARAGRAPHE000066"></a>

If several elements are opened, only the current element is used when calculating the duration.

If the current editor is inactive (another application has focus for instance), the calculation of the duration stops automatically.

If an element remains opened for less than 60 seconds or if it remains inactive for less than 10 seconds, these durations are ignored.
