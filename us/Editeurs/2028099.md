## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000093"></a>
WEBDEV allows you to automatically install several copies of the same site on the same server, without having to rename the project.

A provider can for instance install the same site for different customers on the same server.

The data files can be common or separated by site.

The WEBDEV account can be common or different, with common or different settings.

## How to?
<a name="how_ELTTEXTE000117"></a>
To perform a multiple setup of the same dynamic WEBDEV site on the same server, simply start the site setup wizard: on the "Project" tab, in the "Generation" group, expand "Deploy site" and select "Generate and deploy site".

One of the steps of the wizard allows you to define the deployment name of the site. This allows you to install on the same server several sites with different deployment names. [ProjectInfo](../WDLang1/3064004.md) associated with the *piNameDeployedSite* constant is used to find out the real name of the site
