## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000137"></a>
The setup program creation wizard automatically analyzes and selects the files that will be installed with the site.

During a setup by FTP, click the "Edit the list of files" button to view the list of files taken into account. 

When creating a deployment pack or the setup by physical media, the list of files is automatically proposed. 

Remark: During a setup or update by FTP, you have the ability to compare the files installed on the server with the ones found on the development computer.

By default, the wizard selects all the elements required by the dynamic WEBDEV site to operate:

- libraries (".WDL" files)

- images and static HTML pages (_WEB directory of project)

- style sheets (CSS files)

- dynamic HTML pages (content of directories for project languages)

- ...




For each file (or group of files), yo have the ability to specify via the popup menu whether the file (or the group of files) must be: 

- updated. 

- never modified on the server ("No action" option). No action will be performed on the selected files. 

- deleted from the sever.

- never updated on the sever.


You also have the ability to click the corresponding buttons ("Update", "No action", "Exclude from updates" and "Delete").

The "Compare" button is used to compare the local file and the remote file: size of the file, date and time of modification.

**Remarks**: 

- For an update, only the new files (or the files more recent than the ones previously installed) are marked for deployment.

- You have the ability to filter the files displayed in this window: files to update only, files to delete, to exclude or with no action to perform.




**Case of data files**:

- During a first setup, the data files are automatically proposed by default.

- During an update, the data files are proposed by default only if they do not exist on the server (new data files for example).

- If the data files are manually added into the files to install ("Add additional files" button), these files will be automatically included in the update whenever an update is performed. They will be installed only if these files are more recent than the existing ones.

- To avoid installing the data files, select them and click the "Exclude the selected files definitively" button.




During a deployment on several servers simultaneously, you have the ability to select the files to deploy on each server. The destination directory of each file is common to all the servers.

By default, the wizard selects all the elements required by the dynamic WEBDEV site to operate:

- libraries (".WDL" files)

- images and static HTML pages (_WEB directory of project)

- style sheets (CSS files)

- dynamic HTML pages (content of directories for project languages)

- ...




This list corresponds to the list of files that will be installed. You can:

- delete files from this list ("Exclude the files" button). The excluded files will not be proposed anymore during the next site update. 

- add files into this list ("Add files" button). These files will be automatically proposed during a site update.

- modify the deployment directory. All you have to do is modify the destination directory in the table. 




The wizard can also be used to deploy the site in all languages (by default) or for some languages only. If this option is chosen, a popup allows you to select the desired languages.

**Case of data files**:

- By default, the wizard provides the data files.

- If the data files are manually added into the files to install ("Add files" button), these files will be automatically included in the update whenever an update is performed. They will be installed only if these files are more recent than the existing ones.

- If you don't want to install them, simply select them and click "Exclude files".
