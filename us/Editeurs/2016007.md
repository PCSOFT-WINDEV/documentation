## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000417"></a>
This window allows you to describe a CSS style that will be used for the controls of your WEBDEV project. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Sty.gif&type=thumb)


This window is used to:

- **Modify the characteristics of an existing style**. All you have to do is select the style, the status and the characteristics of the selected style, then validate.
	**Remarks**: 

	- If the style is not "Local" to the control, these modifications will be applied to all the controls that use the modified style.

	- If the style is "local to the control", only the style of the control will be modified. However, the style will be included in the HTML page (consequence: page slower to load).




- **Create a new style**: Click [Create], enter the name and characteristics of the style and validate.

- **Rename a style**: Click the [Rename] button and specify the new name of the style. 
	**Caution**: this option is not recommended. Indeed, this option cancels all the links between the controls that use the style and the renamed style. For the controls that were using the style before it is renamed, this style will be changed into a "Local" style.




This help page presents the different options available in the "Text" tab and in the "Background" tab. The preview is used to dynamically view the characteristics of the style.

## The management of states
<a name="the_management_states_ELTTEXTE000441"></a>
A variation of style can be defined for each status managed by the CSS style sheet. The &lt;Undefined&gt; properties use the properties of the "Normal" status. In the "Normal" status, if a property is &lt;Undefined&gt;, the corresponding options defined in the browser of the Web user will be taken into account.

**Remark**: Some states are not available for all types of controls. The table below presents the possible states according to the controls and to the browsers:
