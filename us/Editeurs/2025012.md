## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000109"></a>
Generating a library consists in selecting the elements handled by this application (windows, reports, classes, sets of procedures, queries, data files...) as well as their dependencies (e.g. images used in the windows). For more details, see the help about the [libraries](../Editeurs/2030022.md).

This screen is displayed when creating the executable if you have chosen to use the main library of the application.

**Remark**: To create the executable, use one of the following methods: 

- On the "Project" tab, in the "Generation" group, click "Generate". 

- Expand ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_generation_exe.gif)
 in the quick access buttons and select "Generate 32-bit Windows executable (exe)" or "Generate 64-bit Windows executable (exe)".




The executable creation wizard allows you to define the operating mode of the executable and the modes for using the library.

The "Operating mode of the executable" screen is used to indicate whether a library is used. If you have chosen to use a library (external or integrated library), the "Generating a library" screen enables you to select the elements that must be included in the library.

Reminder: 

- Library included in the executable: This is the most common option. The WDP file corresponding to the library is included in the executable. 

- Library used externally. In this case, the file of the library is a WDL file generated beside the executable.

## Generating a library: choosing the library elements
<a name="generating_library_choosing_the_library_elements_ELTTEXTE000133"></a>
The library and the current project will have the same name. You can:

- **Modify the name of the library**: simply modify the name directly. 

- **Add elements** ("Add" button): 
	Any type of file can be added to the list of elements inserted into the library: images, text files, etc.

- **Delete elements**:  ("Remove" button)
	The corresponding files and their dependencies will not be included in the library.

- **Create the library from an existing library description** ("WDU" button). 
	When creating a WINDEV or WINDEV Mobile library, a ".WDU" file of the same name is automatically created. This file contains all the references of the elements included in the library. All you have to do is select the WDU file containing the elements to take into account.
