## "User" tab
<a name="user_tab_ELTTEXTE000840"></a>


### User and password
<a name="user_and_password_ELTPARAGRAPHE000115"></a>

The "User" tab is used to manage the characteristics of the current user. 

You can: 

- Identify the current user and change their password if necessary ("Password" button). To change a password, simply write:

	- the current password, 

	- the new password and its confirmation.




- **Request password at startup**: This option is used to enable (or not) the login window when starting the product. This window is used to enter the username and password.

- **Display the username in the editor title**: This allows displaying the name of the current user in the title bar of all the editors. 

- **Synchronize the environnement in the Control Centers**: This option is used to save the environment in the Control Centers. In this case, the environment defined by the developer (position of panes, displayed panes, ...) will be linked to the login for connecting to WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile. The user will be able to access their custom environment from any computer linked to the Control Center database. 

- **Modify the parameters of Control Centers** ("Parameters of the Control Centers" button). This allows you to find out the current setting of the data files found in the Control Centers and to redefine these parameters if necessary. For more details, see [Database of the Control Centers](../CCSuivi/3540720.md).



<a name="NOTE2_2"></a>


### User dictionary
<a name="user_dictionary_ELTPARAGRAPHE000156"></a>

A specific dictionary can be defined for each user.

The elements found in this dictionary (controls, windows, ...) can be directly accessed from the ["Preset controls" pane](../Editeurs/2027035.md).

<a name="NOTE3"></a>
<a name="NOTE3_1"></a>


## "General" tab
<a name="general_tab_ELTTEXTE000870"></a>


### Startup
<a name="startup_ELTPARAGRAPHE000170"></a>

The following options appear in the "Startup" section: 

- **Language of the editor**: This option allows you to choose the display language of the editor: English, Spanish or French. 

- **Load the last project**: This option is used to automatically load the last project opened for the current product.

- **Last projects used** and **Last documents used**: These options allow you to configure the number of last projects and the number of last elements displayed in this list. Simply select the desired element or project to open it directly in the corresponding editor.
	The last documents and projects used are displayed at the end of the options used to open a project: 

	- ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_ouvrir.gif) in the quick access buttons. 

	- on the "Home" tab, in the "General" group, expand "Open". The last files used ("Recent files") and the last projects used ("Recent projects") are displayed: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Fichiers_Recent.gif)



 Remarks:

- The maximum number of projects that can be displayed in this list is set to 10.

- The maximum number of elements that can be displayed is set to 10.

- **DPI management**: Different DPI management modes for displaying the WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile editors: 

	- **Let Windows manage DPI**: This option is recommended when the default mode does not display the font used for the editor options properly, especially in small screens with a high DPI (e.g., Macbook Retina). When using multiple monitors with different DPI settings, images and fonts may be blurred.

	- **Use main screen DPI**: If this option is selected, the WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile editors are displayed according to the resolution of the main screen. This option is recommended when using multiple screens with the same DPI settings as the main screen. 

	- **Independent DPI per screen** (default option): This option allows you to use the WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile editors on multiple screens with different DPI settings. The environments are clearly displayed, regardless of the screen. When switching between different screens (with different DPIs), editors and displayed items resize correctly.





**Caution**: this DPI setting only affects editors for development only. It has no effect on the developed applications. For the developed applications, this setting can be modified in the window description ("UI" tab, "Display in large fonts : Enlarge the window and controls").
<a name="NOTE3_2"></a>


### Backup
<a name="backup_ELTPARAGRAPHE000231"></a>

The backup options are as follows: 

- **Propose to save the element as soon as it is created**: This option (checked by default) is used to open the save window of the element as soon as it is created. This backup is used to immediately enable the completion on the names of controls, ... To go back to the behavior in earlier versions, simply uncheck this option. This option is available from version 22.

- If the **"Manage the automatic backup of project elements (.bk? and .tk?)"** option is checked, two archive files will be generated for each element handled (window, report, class, etc.):

	- **".BK\*" files (".BKW", ".BKE", ".BKR", etc.)**
			The BK\* file is created during the first backup of the object after opening the project. It corresponds to the version of the object when the project was opened.
			The BK\* file allows you to retrieve a project, ... in the state it was before the project was opened in the editor.

	- **".TK\*" files (".TKW", ".TKE", ".TKR", etc.)**
			The TK\* file is created whenever the object is saved. It corresponds to the N-1 status of the object.
			The TK\* file is used to retrieve a project, a window, ... in the status it was before the last backup performed in the editor.


 The ".BK\*" and ".TK\*" files are saved in the "Backup" directory of your project.

- **Allow the projects coming from an earlier version to be opened without backup**: By default, a project backup is automatically performed when opening projects developed with an earlier version. This backup is made in the project directory. If this option is checked, a backup prompt will appear when opening the project in a later version. 

- **Backup for automatic recovery every XXX**: 
	To avoid problems when a system lock occurs (power outage for example), WINDEV, WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile propose a system to automatically recover the elements (queries, reports, windows, etc.) opened in the different editors. This mechanism is enabled by the option "Backup for automatic recovery every XX minutes".
	When this system is enabled:

	- An automatic backup of opened elements is performed at specific time intervals (every 10 minutes by default).

	- When an element is re-opened after a system lockup, an automatic recovery window appears. This window proposes to recover:

		- the element as it was during the last backup performed by the developer.

		- the element automatically saved by WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile.


 The selected version is automatically opened in the corresponding editor. The unselected version is available in the window for version management ("File .. Versions") and it can be opened at any time. For more details, see [Managing versions](../Editeurs/2021002.md).

- **Force the flush**: By default, all the write operations performed by WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile (saving the project elements, ...) are not immediately performed on the network disks.
	To force writing and avoid using "caches", check "Force the flush". This option may slow down some features of the product used (compilation of the project for example). We recommend that you use this option for the projects shared between several developers.
	**Remark**: This option has no effect on the execution of the WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile applications.

### Accelerating the environment
<a name="accelerating_the_environment_ELTPARAGRAPHE000300"></a>

To speed up the environment, you can:

- Choose the project compilation mode: The compilation modes are: 

	- **Single-core**: The compilation uses a single core. The different elements of the project are compiled when the project is opened. You can also request a project recompilation (go to the "Project" tab, "Project" group, expand "Recompile and synchronize" and select "Recompile project"). This recompilation can be performed before creating the executable for example.

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) **In the background**: The compilation in background allows for a non-locking recompilation of the project. You can still use your software during the recompilation.

	- **Multi-core**: All cores are used to compile the project: it is therefore faster than the standard compilation. Starting with version 26 U2, this recompilation mode is selected by default. This recompilation is triggered in the following cases: 

		- when the project is opened, if a complete project recompilation is necessary. 

		- if project recompilation is explicitly requested: on the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, expand "Recompile and synchronize" and select "Recompile project" or "Repair project".

		- when changing a project configuration, only if this project configuration has not yet been enabled on the current computer. 


Remark: By default, all the processor cores will be used if "Multi-core" compilation is chosen. For more specific settings, you can choose the number of threads to use. This allows you to handle special cases and allow other processes to continue to run at a reasonable speed.

- **Disable business rules**: Loading the business rules found in the database of Control Centers may slow down the display of elements in the editor or the loading of the description window. This option is recommended when using a slow network or during a development via the Cloud. 
	Caution: In this case, the business rules are disabled.

- **Disable spelling checker**. By default, the environment uses the Open Office spelling checker. This checker allows you to get real-time spell checking by using the Open Office dictionary. You have the ability to disable this checker. For more details on the spelling checker, see [Check spelling](../Editeurs/1013146.md).

- **Disable speech recognition**. The environment responds to the voice commands (from Windows Vista). Speech recognition can be disabled. For more details, see [Voice commands in the environment](../Editeurs/2020010.md).



<a name="NOTE3_6"></a>


### Source Code Manager (SCM)
<a name="source_code_manager_scm_ELTPARAGRAPHE000374"></a>

The options of WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile allow you to configure the check-out mode for the elements of a project found in the SCM.

Two check-out modes are available for the project elements:

- **The standard mode**: If you display an SCM element that is not checked out, a panel indicates that the element must be checked out before it can be modified.

- **The automatic mode**: If you try to modify an element that has not yet been checked out, the SCM automatically prompts you to check it out. Caution: This mode is not recommended when using the SCM with a slow Internet connection.




The option "Checking out elements during the first modification" is used to switch from standard mode (option not checked) to automatic mode (option checked).

For more details, see [Checking out an element](../Editeurs/2038006.md).
<a name="NOTE3_7"></a>


### Telemetry
<a name="telemetry_ELTPARAGRAPHE000395"></a>

To help improve WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile, you can enable usage metrics by checking "I want to take part in the improvement of XXX". 

By checking this option, you authorize PC SOFT to collect information about your use of WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile. This optional and anonymous collect allows PC SOFT to improve the features of the product used. You will need to restart the product in order to apply this change. 
<a name="NOTE3_8"></a>


### Updates
<a name="updates_ELTPARAGRAPHE000406"></a>

To receive update notifications directly in the IDE, check "Notify me when a XXX update is available".

You will be able to choose to install or not the update. 

<a name="NOTEEDIT"></a>
<a name="NOTEEDIT_1"></a>


## "Editor" tab
<a name="editor_tab_ELTTEXTE000924"></a>


### Themes
<a name="themes_ELTPARAGRAPHE000420"></a>

This option is used to choose the theme of the editor. The light theme is used by default. 

Other themes are available: 

- Light theme, Grey ribbon. In this mode, the menu bar (the ribbon) is not colored anymore: it is grayed out. 

- Gray theme. In this mode, the menu bar (ribbon) is gray and the different windows of the interface are displayed on a light grey background. 

- Dark theme. In this mode, the environment and the different interface windows are displayed on a black or dark gray background. 




Remark: The selected theme will be taken into account when the product used is restarted.

**Tip**: In some cases, it may be necessary to change the theme regularly depending on the current activity: for example, when on a video call, or when using a video projector, the light theme will be preferred, whereas in the development phase, the dark theme will be more appropriate. To start WINDEV in the desired theme without going through the options and restarting the product:

- create a shortcut to the "WINDEV64.exe" file

- in the command line, specify the "/THEME" parameter with the desired theme (DARK, LIGHT or GRAY).




For example: 

```txt
C:\|]\WINDEV 28\Programs\WINDEV64.exe /THEME=DARK
```



### Environment panes
<a name="environment_panes_ELTPARAGRAPHE000444"></a>

This option allows you to choose the panes to display. You also have the ability to choose the panes to display:

- via the ribbon: on the "Home" tab, in the "Environment" group, expand "Panes", select "Panes", and then select the panes you want to display.

- via the context menu of the ribbon.

### Miscellaneous
<a name="miscellaneous_ELTPARAGRAPHE000471"></a>

The following options appear in the "Miscellaneous" section:

- **Expand left pane vertically**: If this option is checked, the panes on the left will occupy all the vertical space in the environment. 

- **Expand right pane vertically**: If this option is checked, the panes on the right will occupy all the vertical space in the environment. 

- **FishEye effect on charts**: the "FishEye" effect is used to enlarge a section of the chart by hovering an area. Its action is equivalent to the one of a magnifier. For more details, see ["FishEye"](../Editeurs/9000067.md). 
	The activation modes of "FishEye" are as follows:

	- **Never**: the "FishEye" mode will never be enabled.

	- **When the zoom is included between 25% and 75%**: the "FishEye" mode will be enabled according to the zoom value.

	- **When the zoom is less than 100%**: the "FishEye" mode will be enabled according to the zoom value.

	- **When Ctrl and Shift are pressed**: the "FishEye" mode will be enabled when pressing a specific key combination.

If your project is multilingual, the characteristics of an element (title of the window, caption of a control, ...) must be entered in all the languages of your application.

You can:

- **Enable the automatic change of input regional settings**: This option allows you to automatically enable the language used by the keyboard when the cursor is positioned in an input area of a language that uses a specific character set.

- **Select a specific translation engine**: the specified translation software will be used to allow an automatic translation from the interface of the product of the different elements to translate. The translation software used can be: 

	- [WDDIXIO](../WDDixio/3514003.md), 

	- a specific software. 
			In this case, you have the ability to configure the mode for transferring the information to translate from WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile to the software used as well as the mode for retrieving the translated information from the translation software.

	- an Internet site.
			 In this case, during a click on the "Translate" button, the text to translate is copied to the clipboard and the Web site is automatically opened. There is no return or direct translation in this mode. 

	- Google Translate. In this case, you must specify the API key expected by Google Traduction. For more details, see [Performing a translation with Google Traduction](../Editeurs/2036003.md). 
			Note: you must comply with the rules for using the service via Google. 




- **Select the supported languages** (source and destination languages)




**Remarks**: 

- To configure the transfer mode properly, see the documentation supplied with your translation software.
