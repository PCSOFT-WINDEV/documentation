## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000178"></a>
Once the component has been created, tested and generated, it can be distributed to other developers. Multiple methods are available: 

- **Direct use of the external component**
	Example: the external component is directly used on the computer of the developer who created it.

- **Standard distribution**, providing the necessary files.
	Example: the external component is intended to be used within the same company, by several developers. In this case, the necessary files can be copied to a network drive.

- **Distribution via the SCM**: This distribution mode allows all projects in the SCM to directly use a component published in the SCM. For more details, see [SCM and components](../Editeurs/2038015.md).
	Example: A company shares several projects via the SCM. The projects used to create the external components and the projects that use the components share the same SCM.

- **Distribution via a setup program** (with a setup procedure of the component similar to the one used for the applications).
	Example: This distribution mode is recommended if the external component is intended to be sold or distributed on a large scale, with regular updates.

## Direct use of the external component
<a name="direct_use_the_external_component_ELTTEXTE000202"></a>


### Definition
<a name="definition_ELTPARAGRAPHE000036"></a>

The external component is created and used on the same computer.

When the external component is imported into a project, all you have to do is select the WDI file corresponding to the component. This file can be found in the EXE directory of the component project. 

The generation directory is the directory associated with the "External component" project configuration.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Composant_MemePoste.gif)

### Caution
<a name="caution_ELTPARAGRAPHE000050"></a>

The files in the &lt;Component name&gt;.WDO file will be automatically copied to the EXE directory of the project that uses the component. 

If the external component uses specific files (data files, text files, etc.), a &lt;Component name&gt;.WDO file must be created (or completed) once the component is generated. This file contains the list of external files (data files, text files, etc.) used by the component. For more details, see [WDO file](../Editeurs/2014005.md).

## Standard distribution of external components

### Definition
<a name="definition_ELTPARAGRAPHE000066"></a>

The standard distribution of an external component consists in copying the files required by the component to a given location. The files are copied to a specific directory. This directory can be located on a network server, for example.

When the external component is imported into a project, all you have to do is select the WDI file corresponding to the component in the distribution directory.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=composant-reseau.gif)

### Necessary elements
<a name="necessary_elements_ELTPARAGRAPHE000078"></a>

To distribute an external component, you must provide:

- The files automatically generated by WINDEV or WEBDEV (&lt;Component name&gt;.WDK and &lt;Component name&gt;.WDI files)

- If necessary, the specific files handled by the component (data files, initialization files, etc.) as well as the &lt;Component name&gt;.WDO file. The &lt;Component name&gt;.WDO file contains the list of files that must be provided with the component. For more details on this file, see [Distributing an advanced component: WDO file](../Editeurs/2014005.md).

## Distribution via a setup procedure

### Definition

The distribution of external components using a setup procedure requires providing a setup program to the users. This program installs all the files required for the external component in the directory specified by the user.

This installation mode allows you to automatically manage:

- the WDO file and the installation of specific files (data files, etc.) used by the external component.

- the installation of specific tools (MDAC, ODBC driver for HFSQL, etc.).

- the automatic update of data files used by the external component (if necessary).

- the uninstallation of the external component.

<a name="NOTE4_2"></a>
To create a setup procedure for an external component: 

1. Create the setup procedure of the external component directly from the quick access buttons: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_Composant_installation.gif)


2. In the different steps of the wizard, specify:

	- the name of the external component.

	- the languages of the setup procedure.

	- the title of the main window of the setup program. You can configure the interface of the installer via the "Advanced" button. 

	- the files installed. You can add specific files on top of the default component files. The WDO file will be automatically created from this list.

	- the default component setup directory. You can configure the changes to be made to the system via the "Advanced" button. 

	- the optional modules to install. 

	- the installation media, security options and advanced parameters. 

	- ...







By default, the files required to install an external component are created in the "&lt;Project name&gt;\\EXE\\INSTALL_COMPO&lt;Component name&gt;" subdirectory.

**Reminder**: When creating the installation of an application, the necessary files are created in the "&lt;Project name&gt;\\EXE\\INSTALL" subdirectory.
