## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000106"></a>
The description of an [internal component](../Editeurs/2014100.md) can be opened at any time. This window contains all the options specific to the internal component.

To open the description of the internal component: 

1. Select the internal component in the "Project explorer" pane.

2. Select "Internal component description" in the context menu.

## Details

The different tabs of the description window are as follows:

- ***"Description" tab***: This tab shows the name, caption and description of the internal component. You can change these details directly.

- ***"Elements" tab***: This tab lists the elements of the internal component. You can:

	- add elements to the internal component ("Add elements" button). Simply select the desired element in the list of project elements. 

	- remove elements from the internal component. Simply select the element(s) to be removed and click "Delete elements". The element can be removed from the internal component only or from the internal component and the project.

	- change public elements to private and vice versa. Simply check the elements you want to make public. 




- ***"Analysis" tab***: This tab is used to configure the management mode of the data and execution contexts. There are three modes to manage data and execution contexts:

	- **Use the project analysis or no analysis (full share)**: The internal component accesses the data files of the project. The internal component and the project use the same execution contexts. 
			This is the default mode if the internal component does not use an analysis.

	- **Use the project analysis with different execution contexts (advanced mode)**: The internal component accesses the data files of the project. The internal component and the project use different execution contexts. 
			This mode is reserved to specific cases.

	- **Use a specific analysis**: The internal component accesses its own data files: it is stand-alone. The internal component and the project use different execution contexts. 
			This is the default mode if the component uses an analysis. 
			In this case, the analysis used by the internal component and its password (if any) must be specified. You can also create a new analysis directly or import an analysis from the SCM. This analysis will be associated with the internal component.


![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Remark: If the internal component includes an analysis, it will be ignored at runtime.

- ***"Live Data" tab***: This tab is available if the internal component has a specific analysis. It is used to configure the "Live Data" for the internal component, which means the ability to view the content of data files in the editor directly.

- ***"UML" tab***: This tab allows you to link an UML model to the internal component.

- ***"Dependencies" tab***: This tab shows the list of dependencies associated with the internal component. 

- ***"Compilation" tab***: This tab contains the options to define the programming standard of the internal component. For more details, see [Programming standard errors](../Editeurs/9000187.md).
