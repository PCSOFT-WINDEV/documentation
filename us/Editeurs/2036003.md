## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000144"></a>
WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile allow you to support up to 64 languages in the same project: window, report, WLangage, etc.

The translation of the different languages can be performed afterwards by using WDMSG or in the editors directly.

To facilitate this translation, the publishers suggest calling up "Google Translate" to perform these translations.

Caution: Of course you must comply with the Google service usage rules, which are subject to change over time.

To get the API key required to use Google Translation: 

1. You must own a Google account. 

2. Log in to the Google API console to enable the "Translate API" service ([https://code.google.com/apis/console](https://code.google.com/apis/console), link valid at the time of writing this document). 

3. A new option ("API Access") appears. Click this option. 

4. Your "API Key" is generated and displayed in the page. This key must be entered in the window of WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile options. 




Remarks: 

- The invoicing information must be properly filled for the Google account. Indeed, Google Translation is not a free service. If this information is not specified, an error will occur when attempting to perform a translation. 

- For more details on how to obtain the API key and how to use Google Translate, see [https://developers.google.com/translate/v2/faq](https://developers.google.com/translate/v2/faq)

- The version of the translation API used is v2.
