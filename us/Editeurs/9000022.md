## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000115"></a>
The Automatic Application Features (AAF) allow you to add features to your application without having to write a single line of code. All you have to do is check the relevant options in order to benefit from these features.

Some examples of AAF:

- [Add an automatic menu in tables for the user](../Editeurs/9500102.md).

- [Generate a help for your application](../Editeurs/2010030.md).

- [Use the timer buttons](../Editeurs/9500100.md).

- [Perform multi-control searches](../Editeurs/9500101.md).

- [Propose to use a spelling checker (OpenOffice) in the edit controls and in the table columns](../Editeurs/1013146.md).

- [Create custom keyboard shortcuts](../Editeurs/9500108.md).

- [Sort the list boxes and combo boxes](../Editeurs/9500115.md).

- [Go to a line number in an edit control](../Editeurs/9500120.md).

- [Copy and paste the content of the window controls](../Editeurs/9500116.md).


**Help the users**
Use the [AAFOpenHelp](../WDLang1/1410089447.md) function to allow users to access the documentation about the automatic features in your application (sort and search in tables, chart options, etc.). The [https://aaf.windev.com/](https://aaf.windev.com/) site presents the automatic features available in your applications: resize windows, table options, chart options, etc.). .
