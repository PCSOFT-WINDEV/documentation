### Handles of controls
<a name="handles_controls_ELTPARAGRAPHE000084"></a>

Handles appear around new or selected controls. Handles allow you to:

- view the control size,

- change the control size.

![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=PoigneeGriseBlanche.gif)
The colors of the handles identify the actions that can be performed:

- The **black handles** are used to view and resize a control.

- The **white handles** can only be used to see a control. For example, when selecting several controls, the white handles indicate that the selected controls cannot be resized.
	This type of handles is also displayed when a window is in read-only mode for the developer: the controls cannot be modified.

- The **gray handles** indicate the first selected control during a multiple selection. This control will be the reference control.
