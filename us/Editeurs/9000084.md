## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000420"></a>
WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile allow you to manage the business rules. A business rule is used to define a specific operating mode or to specify a particular process. For example: calculating a VAT rate, the rules for changing the status of a customer, the formula used to to calculate shipping and handling charges, ...

A business rule can be simple or complex.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=RegleMetier.GIF)
Business rules are set by the project requirements, the project architect, the project manager, the developers, etc.

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Business rules can also be implemented from suggestions made by application users via the ["?" menu](../Editeurs/9000070.md). In this case, the [Feedback component](../Editeurs/2014013.md) is used. 

A business rule is specific to a project and it can be linked to one or more project elements.

- "Pending": the business rule is not yet applied to this element.

- "In progress": the business rule is currently applied to this element.

- "Done": the business rule is applied to the element.

- "Not affected": the element is not affected by the business rule.




The validation rate of a business rule is calculated as follows: Number of links for which the rule is respected / Total number of links x 100.
