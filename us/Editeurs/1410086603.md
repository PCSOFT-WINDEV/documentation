To display an existing image, you can: 

- use the "Images" pane in the WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile editor. This pane lists the images located in the current project directory (or in the _WEB directory for a WEBDEV project). You can also open an image located on the disk. For more details, see [The "Images" pane](../Editeurs/2027036.md). 

- use the context menu of the control displaying the image: 

	- Open the context menu of the control (e.g., Image or Button control). 

	- Select the option "Edit image".




- use the control description window: In the "General" tab, expand ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Menu_Image_Editeur%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif) on the right of the image path and select "Edit image".




The selected image appears in the image editor and can be edited.

### Saving an edited image
<a name="saving_edited_image_ELTPARAGRAPHE000082"></a>

An image edited in the image editor can be saved via the ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_Enregistrer.gif) icon of the ribbon. 

Several cases may occur: 

- If the image does not have any layers (simple image directly edited or flattened image), it is automatically saved in its original format with the same name. Therefore, the existing image is directly updated in the windows, reports, etc. that use the image. 

- If the image has at least one layer, it can be saved in different formats: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Editeur_img_sauver%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)


	- **Image in PNG format only**. The layers will be lost.

- **Image in PNG and WDPIC format**. The name of the WDPIC image file is in the following format: "initialimagename.initialextension.wdpic". The WDPIC image contains the description of all layers and changes made the original image. The original image does not change. If you try to load an image that has an equivalent .wdpic file, the .wdpic file is automatically loaded in the image editor.

- **Image in WDPIC format** only. 
			In this case, the original image does not change. 
			The WDPIC image can be associated with the different elements of your projects, like any other image format.




Remark: Once the format is selected, the future changes are saved in the same format. 


### Saving a new image or icon
<a name="saving_new_image_icon_ELTPARAGRAPHE000105"></a>

If you created an image or icon in the image editor, you can save it by clicking ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_Enregistrer.gif) in the ribbon. The save window appears and prompts you to save: 

- the image in "wdpic" format by default. 

- the icon in "ico" format by default. 




To change the format in which the image will be saved, click "..." and select the desired format. The following formats are available: WDPIC, TIF, ICO, PNG, JPEG, BMP and GIF. 

Remark: Once the format is selected, the future changes are saved in the same format.
