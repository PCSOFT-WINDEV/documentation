	From version <B>18</B>, the User Groupware evolves. This help page corresponds to the User Groupware kept for backward compatibility. For help on the new version of the User Groupware, see [User Groupware](../Editeurs/1000021152.md).

## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000235"></a>
An application is often intended to be used by several users connected via a network. Similarly, a site is always intended to be used by several Web users. In most cases, different access levels must be defined according to the user or to the Web user.

To manage these access levels in your WINDEV applications or WEBDEV sites, simply include the User Groupware. In just a few clicks, a standard application can be transformed into an application that manages several access levels. This feature can be easily implemented.

For more details on the User Groupware, see [User Groupware overview](../Editeurs/2018001.md).

### User Groupware in the Linux sites
<a name="user_groupware_the_linux_sites_ELTPARAGRAPHE000044"></a>

To use the user groupware, the specific pages of user groupware must be included in the site ("Custom integration").

## Options of the "General" tab
<a name="options_the_general_tab_ELTTEXTE000289"></a>


### Integration mode of groupware
<a name="integration_mode_groupware_ELTPARAGRAPHE000053"></a>

Two modes are available for including the User Groupware in your application:

- **Default integration**: 
	The programming of the User Groupware is automatically included in your application. 
	***A new window or page is included in your project: The login window/page***. It is displayed when the application is started and it allows the user to connect to the application. You can customize this window/page by applying the skin template of your application for example.

- **Custom integration**: 
	The programming of the User Groupware is automatically included in your application.
	***All the windows or pages required to manage the User Groupware (login and management of users) are automatically included in your project***. You can customize all the windows or pages used by the user groupware.




The different windows or pages used by the User Groupware are presented in [The windows and pages of the User Groupware](../Editeurs/2018010.md).
<a name="NOTE3_2"></a>


### Starting the User Groupware
<a name="starting_the_user_groupware_ELTPARAGRAPHE000076"></a>

Two modes can be used to start the User Groupware:

- ***Automatic start***: The login window or page of the User Groupware is displayed before any other window/page of the application. The initialization code of project is run when the login window/page is opened and validated.

- ***Manual start***: The login window or page will only be opened if [gpwOpen](../WDLang6/3041002.md) is used. This option is used to run the initialization code of project before opening the login window/page. This option is useful for a multilingual application for example: A window or a page can be displayed to request the runtime language of the application.



<a name="NOTE3_3"></a>


### Automatic login in test mode
<a name="automatic_login_test_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000089"></a>

Specify the login and password that will be used in [automated test](../Editeurs/2019025.md) mode. This information will be used if an automated test is run on the application.
<a name="NOTE3_4"></a>


### Using a LDAP directory to authenticate the users
<a name="using_ldap_directory_authenticate_the_users_ELTPARAGRAPHE000099"></a>

If the company of your customer uses an LDAP directory, you can enable the User Groupware on this directory. Therefore, the account and the password found in the LDAP directory will be automatically asked to the user.

Two modes are available:

- **Without management of rights**: In this case, no groupware file will be created. If the application is started in automatic mode, the user will need to log in. If the user is saved in the LDAP directory, the application will start; otherwise, it will be closed. A supervisor cannot configure the rights on the windows or pages.

- **With management of rights**: Only the users found in the LDAP directory can connect. The rights can be configured on the windows or pages.




For more details, see [User Groupware and LDAP directory](../Editeurs/2018013.md).

Remark: The User Groupware works with Active Directory. It does not operate with openLDAP.

## "Files" tab
<a name="files_tab_ELTTEXTE000331"></a>


### Password of data files
<a name="password_data_files_ELTPARAGRAPHE000120"></a>

By default, the data files found in the User Groupware have a specific password. This password is: ***"PCSGPW2001***".

To change this password, enter the new password. The characters typed are hidden.

**Remark**: This password is used when the files are re-indexed or when the files are opened by WDMAP.

For more details, see [User Groupware files](../Editeurs/2018002.md).

### Enabling the history of connections
<a name="enabling_the_history_connections_ELTPARAGRAPHE000136"></a>

If the history of connections is enabled:

- An additional data file is created: GPW_CONNECTIONLOG. This file contains the history of connections.

- When configuring the application, the supervisor can access the history of connections via the "History of connections" button. 
	This history is displayed in a specific window/page. This page is used to identify all the users who have been connected to a given application during a specific period. A chart indicates the number of connections per hour during the day. A button is available to clear the history if necessary.



<a name="NOTE4_3"></a>


### Type of database
<a name="type_database_ELTPARAGRAPHE000148"></a>

The User Groupware handles several categories of files:

- **the data files used to identify the users**. These users can use several applications. Therefore, these files can be shared among several applications.

- **the data files used to manage the user rights** on the windows/pages of the application.




These files can be:

- in HyperFileSQL Classic format (by default). You can specify the directory in which each category of user files (specific to the user groupware) will be created and used for the test of your application.

- in HyperFileSQL Client/Server format. The characteristics of the connection to the HyperFileSQL server must be specified as well as the directory of the different categories of files.




For more details, see [The data files of user groupware](../Editeurs/2018002.md).

## "LDAP" tab
<a name="ldap_tab_ELTTEXTE000367"></a>


### Characteristics of LDAP server
<a name="characteristics_ldap_server_ELTPARAGRAPHE000170"></a>

If the User Groupware was configured to use an LDAP directory, the LDAP tab is used to configure the characteristics of LDAP server used for test (and at runtime).

The requested information is:

- Server address

- Port number of server.

- Version of contacted LDAP server.




In the code, simply use [gpwOpenLDAPSession](../WDLang6/1000017055.md).

For more details, see [User Groupware and LDAP](../Editeurs/2018013.md).
