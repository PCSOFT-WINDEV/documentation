| Automatic ID | the identifier of each file record. <br>Its value is automatically updated by the engine of the HFSQL database.<br><br>- **Automatic identifier (4 bytes)**: the identifier of each record (value included between 0 and 2.147.483.647)<br>	This type corresponds to the "Identifier" type of WINDEV 5.5<br><br>- **Automatic identifier (8 bytes)**: the identifier of each record (value included between 0 and 9.223.372.036.854.775.807)<br><br>- **Automatic UUID (128 bits)**: the identifier of each record corresponds to a 128-bit UUID. In this case, the UUID is used to obtain a non-sequential unique identifier.<br><br>- **Automatic UUID (256 bits)**: the identifier of each record corresponds to a 256-bit UUID. In this case, the UUID is used to obtain a non-sequential unique identifier.<br><br><br><br><br>Remark: The same record can have an automatic UUID and an automatic Identifier (for example, to simplify migration). <br><br> |
| XML | an XML character string (4 GB maximum). This string is stored as a text memo. |
| Full-text index | the different elements of the full-text index. The full-text index can include text items or text memo items.<br><br>For more details on how to create a full-text index in the analysis, see [Search and full-text index](../WDLang4/3044375.md). |
| Enumeration, Combination | <br><br>- Enumeration: an integer value among the possible values defined in the enumeration associated with the item.<br><br>- Combination: an integer value representing a combination of possible values defined in the combination associated with the item.<br><br><br><br><br>For details on how to create an Enumeration or Combination item, see [Enumeration and Combination items](../Editeurs/9500222.md). |
| Formula | a character string in SQL language representing a calculation formula. The formula can use SQL functions and/or WLanguage functions (WL.). Only the formula is stored, the value is calculated when accessing the record in read-only.<br><br>For example, calculating the age from the DateOfBirth item of the file. The value will be calculated in the data file directly. <br><br><pre><code>CAST(TO_CHAR(SYSDATE,'YYYY') AS int)<br>	- CAST(TO_CHAR(datenaissance, 'YYYY') AS int)</code></pre><br><br><br>However, the calculated value can be stored in the file to avoid having to perform the calculation again.<br><br>You have the ability to store the formula in Unicode: the calculation will be faster but a bigger space will be occupied by the formula.<br><br>If the record is modified, the calculation formula is re-run in order to update the buffer of the data file with the new value.<br><br>Caution: The NULL management complies with the SQL standard. For example, if an expression adds the NULL value to a value, the result corresponds to the NULL value. |
| Timestamp | a DateTime or a Date or a Time representing the creation date of the record or the date of the last modification performed on the record.<br><br>You can select: <br><br>- whether the creation date or the last modification date must be saved.<br><br>- whether the local time or the UTC time must be used.<br><br><br><br><br>This type of item is also called "Automatic DateTime item". |
| UUID | a UUID. A UUID (Universal Unique IDentifier) is a random number deemed unique. A UUID is useful to easily and reliably identify any element.<br><br>You can select: <br><br>- a 128-bit UUID. This type of UUID item complies with the 128-bit RFC 4122 standard. Only the 128-bit UUID is standardized.<br><br>- a 256-bit UUID. <br><br><br><br><br>To manage an automatic identifier of type UUID (automatically initialized by HFSQL), it is necessary to use an item of type "Identifier", with the "Automatic UUID" subtype. <br><br>Remark: The major interest of UUID is to allow anonymization and pseudonymization, useful for compliance with the GDPR standard. The UUID also allows you to manage cryptocurrency identifiers. |
| JSON | a JSON string. This type of item can contain NULL, an empty string or a valid JSON. JSON is automatically verified when the record is written. <br><br>This type of item is used with JSON SQL functions in particular. |
| Password | a string used as a password. <br><br>The string contained in this item is salted and hashed. The result of these operations is stored in the item, as well as the salt and the type of algorithm used. It is not possible to reconstruct the original password using this data..  <br><br>This password cannot be displayed to the user.<br><br>You can select: <br><br>- the key derivation function,<br><br>- the hash algorithm,<br><br>- the number of iterations,<br><br>- the output length. <br><br><br><br><br> For more details, see [Type of item: Secure password](../Editeurs/9500235.md). |


**Remark**: Unicode items are managed by the wdxxxuni.dll library. This library is not available in WINDEV Mobile.


### Array items
<a name="array_items_ELTPARAGRAPHE000235"></a>

Some types of items can correspond to an array: the item content will be indexed.

To define an Array item: 

1. Create an item. The following types of items can correspond to an array: Text, Numeric, Currency, Date, Time, Boolean, Check Box. 

2. In the item description: 

	- Check "Array" and specify the array dimension. 
			Caution: The array dimension is fixed. The corresponding space is reserved even if the item is not filled.

	- The actual item size is displayed.




3. Specify (if necessary) the default values of each array element. 

4. Validate. 




**Remarks**: 

- The first index starts at 1. 

- The following syntax is used to handle array items: &lt;File name&gt;.&lt;Item name&gt;[&lt;Index&gt;]

- Caution: This type of item is kept for backward compatibility. Most of SQL databases do not support this type of items.
