## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000102"></a>
<a name="Query_description"></a>
Once a query is created, all the characteristics of this query can be modified at any time:

- files and/or items used,

- items displayed in the query result,

- selection conditions,

- sort of records,

- ...




Only the query type cannot be modified. Indeed, too many specific parameters are taken into account. To change the query type, all you have to do is create a new query.

<a name="NOTE2_1"></a>


## Description window
<a name="description_window_ELTTEXTE000126"></a>
The main characteristics of a query can be accessed in the description window of the query. The query editor proposes three description windows:

- [description window of a select query](../Editeurs/2032049.md).

- [description window of an insert query, update query, delete query](../Editeurs/2032036.md) or in SQL code.

- [description window of a combining query](../Editeurs/2032031.md).


To display the description window of a query:

- double-click the graphic representation of the query.

- select "Query description" in the context menu of the query editor.

- on the "Query" tab, in the "Edit" group, click "Description".
