## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000210"></a>
WEBDEV offers several methods to test and debug a site on the development computer (see [The different types of WEBDEV tests](../Editeurs/2019003.md)). However, in some cases, you may have to debug the site directly on the user computers.

From your office in London, you have the ability to debug a site running on a Web server in Taiwan. The debug operation is done without having to go anywhere, on the final configuration directly.

Two features are available:

- Starting and debugging the site on a remote application server.

- Debugging a site currently used on a remote application server.




For these two features, a specific configuration of the remote computer is required.

**Caution**: This feature is not available for sites deployed on a Linux application server.

## Configuring the remote WEBDEV application server
<a name="configuring_the_remote_webdev_application_server_ELTTEXTE000234"></a>
To debug a dynamic WEBDEV site on a remote application server, you must:

- **open the main port and the ports of sessions** if a firewall is used. The main port is port 27271 by default and the ports of sessions are ports 27280 to 27289 by default. 
	These ports must be open because the communication with the remote WEBDEV Application Server is established using sockets.
	The ports used can be modified in the WEBDEV application server ("Configuration" tab of the administrator).

- **allow the remote debugging** on the WEBDEV application server. To do so, check "Allow the remote debugging" in the "Configuration" tab of the administrator.

## Starting and debugging a site on a remote application server
<a name="starting_and_debugging_site_remote_application_server_ELTTEXTE000258"></a>
To run and debug a site on a remote application server:

1. Open the relevant project in WEBDEV.

2. Check the configuration of the remote server.

3. On the "Project" tab, in the "Test mode" group, expand "Test mode" and select "Connect to a site and debug connection".

4. In the window that is displayed, enter:

	- the name or IP address of the remote WEBDEV application server.

	- the main debugging port.




5. Click the "Refresh" button. The names of the sites that can be debugged are displayed.

6. Select the desired site and validate.

7. The site is started in debug mode on the development computer. You can handle the site and monitor the code run via the debugger (by inserting breakpoints in the code sections that cause problems for example).




Remarks:

- If the debug operation is performed on a development server, the elements being edited are run and [InTestMode](../WDLang1/3013011.md) returns <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>.

- If the debug operation is performed on a WEBDEV application server for deployment, the code run is the code found in the library (WDL file). Therefore, the code of the current project in the editor and the code of the site can become out-of-sync: the out-of-sync code is highlighted in pink during the debug operation. [InTestMode](../WDLang1/3013011.md) returns <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>.

## Debugging a site currently used on a remote application server
<a name="debugging_site_currently_used_remote_application_server_ELTTEXTE000282"></a>
To debug a site already started on a remote application server:

1. Open the relevant project in WEBDEV.

2. Check the configuration of the remote server.

3. On the "Project" tab, in the "Test mode" group, expand "Test mode" and select "Debug an existing connection".

4. In the window that is displayed, enter:

	- the name or IP address of the remote WEBDEV application server.

	- the main debugging port.




5. Click the "Refresh" button. The names of the sites that can be debugged are displayed, with the identifier of the connected client.

6. Select the desired site and connection and validate.

7. The project is in debugging mode.




Remarks:

- If the debug operation is performed on a development server, the elements being edited are run and [InTestMode](../WDLang1/3013011.md) returns <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>.

- If the debug operation is performed on a WEBDEV application server for deployment, the code run is the code found in the library (WDL file). Therefore, the code of the current project in the editor and the code of the site can become out-of-sync: the out-of-sync code is highlighted in pink during the debug operation. [InTestMode](../WDLang1/3013011.md) returns <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>.

## Starting the debugger and stopping the test

### Starting the debugger
<a name="starting_the_debugger_ELTPARAGRAPHE000144"></a>

To start the debugger while running the test of the site, use the editor:

- In the "Debugger" tab, click "Pause" (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=main_debog.gif)).

- A breakpoint can also be included in the code editor in front of the desired line of code. The debugger will be automatically displayed when the corresponding line is run.

### Stopping the test
<a name="stopping_the_test_ELTPARAGRAPHE000156"></a>

There are multiple methods to stop the test:

- 1st method: Close the browser. WEBDEV displays the editor open when the test was started.

- 2nd method: In the editor, stop the debugger (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=EtatIconeArretTest.gif) or Shift + F5).
