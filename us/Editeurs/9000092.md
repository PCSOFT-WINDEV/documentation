<a name="associating_document_the_project_creation_wizard_ELTPARAGRAPHE000043"></a>

To associate a document in the project creation wizard:

1. Go to "Description - Attached documents".

2. To add an existing document, click the "Add an existing document" button and select the file to add. This file can be copied (or not) into the "Documents" subdirectory of the current project.

3. To add a scanned document:

	- position the document to scan in a scanner accessible from the current computer.

	- click "Scan a document...".

	- if several scanners are accessible from the current computer, select the scanner that will be used.

	- specify the name of the scanned document. By default, this document is saved in the "Documents" subdirectory of the current directory.




4. The documents associated with the project are listed.

5. To delete a document from this list, select the document to delete and click "Remove from the list".




**Remark**: In this step of the wizard, you can create a skeleton of the folder for project specifications ("Generate outline for specifications"). A "&lt;Project name&gt;.RTF" file is automatically created in the "Documents" subdirectory of the current project. This file contains the skeleton of the project specifications (objective, overview, task summary, ...) and it can be modified in the next step.
