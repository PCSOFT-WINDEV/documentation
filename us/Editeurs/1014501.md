## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000397"></a>
The static audit is a feature of the environment that analyzes a project to detect potential issues and suggests improvements.

The static audit includes:

- [The static audit of the project](#StaticAudit).

- [The audit of the content of the application library](#AuditInstall).

- [The audit of the setup content](#LibAudit).

### Start static audit
<a name="start_static_audit_ELTPARAGRAPHE000026"></a>

To start the static audit of the project:

- In the [Project dashboard](../Editeurs/9500221.md) click the gray arrow of the "Static audit" widget. The static audit of the project starts.


or

- On the "Project" tab, in the "Audit and performance" group, expand "Static audit" and select "Start static audit". The audit wizard opens. Select the type of audit to perform: 

	- Audit of the entire project. The current project will be analyzed. 

	- Audit of some project elements. In the following plane, select the elements to audit. At the end of the wizard, the audit will be started on the selected elements. 







The audit window opens:

![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=audit_statique_fen.gif&type=thumb)
1: In the main area, the audit presents the different problems detected.

2: For each problem, the editor suggests an automatic fix via the "..." button. Depending on the type of problem, you might be prompted to change a value in a configuration window, or the problem may be fixed automatically.

3: Each information notified by the static audit of project can be ignored. To do so, select "Ignore this information" in the context menu of information table. This button allows you to see the information that was disabled and to re-enable it.

4: The "Refresh" button restarts the project analysis and refreshes the table.

5: The "Print" button is used to print a detailed report about the detected problems.

**Remarks**: 

- The window for static audit is a non-modal window and it can remain opened while correcting the errors. It does not interfere with the use of development environment.

- The static audit also lists the problems detected by the UI audit. These problems are related to the use of obsolete features that can slow down your project, the generation of the application or the application itself, ... For more details, see [UI audit](../Editeurs/9000207.md). 





### List of errors detected by the static audit
<a name="list_errors_detected_the_static_audit_ELTPARAGRAPHE000075"></a>

The static audit of project can detect the following errors:

** **Compilation problems detected by the static audit** **

|   |
| --- |
| A native access is used by the project but it is not installed on the computer. |
| Unused code was detected. |
| Unused variables have been detected. |
| Project elements are orphan elements (they are never used in the project code). |
| Compilation errors (UI or code) have been detected. |
| The project uses more than 1000 elements. We recommend that you use the 64-bit version of WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile. |
| The compilation directory (&lt;ProjectName&gt;.CPL directory) is found on a network disk. The editor performance may be slowed down. We recommend that you use a local directory. This directory can be configured in the project options. |





** **Problems in the analysis detected by the static audit** **

|   |
| --- |
| A native access is used by the project but it is not installed on the computer. |
| Tip: The analysis has no link. <br>We advise you to create links in order to ensure data consistency.<br><br>The lack of link definition does not allow for automatic management of referential integrity, which is a risk to the application quality. |





** **Problems of SCM (Source Code Manager) detected by the static audit** **

|   |
| --- |
| Project elements have been checked out from the SCM since a long time without being checked back in. |
| Elements are currently checked out in test mode. |
|   |
| Tip: we advise you to disable the archiving of the analysis in SCM. |
| Tip: we advise you to convert the analysis to the new format. For more details, see [New analysis format](../Editeurs/2011011.md). |





** **Problems common to the window editor, page editor and report editor detected by the static audit** **

|   |
| --- |
| Spelling mistakes have been detected. |
| Unused groups of controls have been detected. |
| Some elements do not contain all project languages. |
| Some elements are not updated from their templates. |
| Dissociated styles have been detected. |





** **Problems of window editor detected by the static audit** **

|   |
| --- |
| Unused styles have been detected. |
| An internal window is not updated from its template. |
| A "File path" type input mask is selected, but path entry assistance is not offered. |
| Identifying the windows managing (or not) the large fonts<br>One or more windows include a display mode in large font that differs from the mode used by most application windows.<br>The management mode of large fonts must be identical for all application windows. <br>The "..." button allows you to get the list of project windows with their management mode of large fonts. All you have to do is choose the requested option and apply the modifications.  |
| Charts may show jagged graphics if the anti-aliasing option is not enabled. |





** **Problems of page editor detected by the static audit** **

|   |
| --- |
| The referencing optimizations have not been applied. |





** **Problems of report editor detected by the static audit** **

|   |
| --- |
| A report is based on a Table control that does not exist. |
| An internal report uses a non-existent report. |
| A report uses the "Integrated code" option while this is not required. |





** **Problems of the query editor detected by the static audit** **

|   |
| --- |
| One or more optimizations on the project queries have been detected. |
| One or more queries affect data files that do no longer exist in the analysis. |





** **Problems of the automated test detected by the static audit** **

|   |
| --- |
| One or more automated tests have encountered errors.        |





** **Problems of code editor detected by the static audit** **

|   |
| --- |
| Unused multilingual messages have been detected. |
| Too many errors have been disabled. |
| The percentage of comments in the project is too low. |
| The average number of lines per process is too high. |





** **Problems of project editor detected by the static audit** **

|   |
| --- |
| One or more configurations generate several targets. |
| The automatic check-out from SCM is not enabled. |
| The skin template of the project is not installed on the computer. |
| The former mechanism of developer groupware is used. |
| The performance profiler has not been used since a long time. In this case, the static audit proposes to start [the performance profiler](../Editeurs/2030035.md). |
| The description file of the code style was not found. |
| The project has not been cleaned since a long time. In this case, the static audit proposes to start the [project cleaner](../Editeurs/9000068.md). |
| The UI errors are disabled. |
| The spelling checker of OpenOffice is not installed on the computer. |
| The project is huge and it does not use the SCM. |
| Elements are found in different versions. For more details, see [Managing the element versions](../Editeurs/2021002.md). |
| Unused elements are found in the project directory. In this case, the static audit is used to start the [search for orphan elements](../Editeurs/9000075.md).  |
| The project uses the developer groupware and not the Source Code Manager. |


**Remark**: The above list is not exhaustive, new errors may be added as updates are made.

## The audit of the content of the application library
<a name="the_audit_the_content_the_application_library_ELTTEXTE000451"></a>


### Overview
<a name="overview_ELTPARAGRAPHE000267"></a>

The audit of the application library content shows the size of the different project elements included in the library. This information is displayed in a table and in a TreeMap: this allows you to view the importance of the size of elements in relation to the other ones. 

To start the audit regarding the content of application library:

- In the [Project dashboard](../Editeurs/9500221.md) click the gray arrow of the "Static audit" widget. The static audit starts. Select the "Library analysis" tab.


or

- On the "Project" tab, in the "Audit and performance" group, expand "Static audit" and select "Analysis of the library (EXE, WDK, WDL)".




**Remark**: the application library (WDL, WDK, EXE...) must have been generated at least once in order to use this audit.


### Interpreting the results of the audit regarding the library content
<a name="interpreting_the_results_the_audit_regarding_the_library_content_ELTPARAGRAPHE000297"></a>

The audit of the library content is used to detect the following problems:

- Presence of an unwanted file in the application library

- Graphic visualization of size occupied by each file.




From the audit window, ability to directly display an element selected in its editor. To do so, select the element and click the "View" button.

The audit of the application setup content shows the size of the different elements included in the setup. This information is displayed in a table and in a TreeMap: this allows you to view the importance of the size of elements in relation to the other ones. 

To start the audit of the application setup:

- In the [Project dashboard](../Editeurs/9500221.md) click the gray arrow of the "Static audit" widget. The static audit starts. Select the "Analysis of the setup package" tab.


or

- On the "Project" tab, in the "Audit and performance" group, expand "Static audit" and select "Analysis of the setup package".




**Remark**: The setup must have been generated at least once in order to use this audit.

### Interpreting the results of the audit regarding the setup content
<a name="interpreting_the_results_the_audit_regarding_the_setup_content_ELTPARAGRAPHE000344"></a>

The audit of the setup content is used to detect the following problems:

- Presence of an unwanted file in the application setup: test files for example.

- Presence of the same file several times in the setup.

- Graphic visualization of size occupied by each file.
