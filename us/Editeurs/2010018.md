## Allow reverse compilation
<a name="allow_reverse_compilation_ELTTEXTE000133"></a>
If this option is checked, the CHM help file can be reverse-compiled (with the appropriate tool). This means you can get all the HTML pages and files used by the help pages (images, for example).

Reverse-compiling help files allows you to get the different pages directly from the compiled file, even if you don't have the source elements of the help system.

## Compiling the information for the full-text search
<a name="compiling_the_information_for_the_fulltext_search_ELTTEXTE000157"></a>
This option allows you to propose an advanced search mode ("Search" tab of the help).

To propose this mode, a list of words used in all the page of the help system is automatically created during the compilation.

In order for this option to be available in help systems created with WINDEV, you must own the full help compiler.

**Remark: Advanced search:** In this mode, the text entered by the user will be searched in all the help pages of the file. When the search is validated, the list of pages containing the text is displayed. Only the titles of the pages are displayed in this list. Simply select a page to open it.

## Creating a binary index
<a name="creating_binary_index_ELTTEXTE000181"></a>
If this option is checked, a binary index is created. This index will be compiled in the CHM help file directly. Therefore, the size occupied by the index will be reduced.

This option is required if you want your index to be sorted in alphabetical order.

## Creating a binary table of contents
<a name="creating_binary_table_contents_ELTTEXTE000205"></a>
This option is recommended for the large help systems so that the summary loads faster when the help file is opened. It also reduces the time required to open a help page from the summary.

## Remark
<a name="remark_ELTTEXTE000229"></a>
For security reasons, Windows only allows opening CHM files locally. You cannot open CHM files located on a network.
