## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000134"></a>
WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile allow the use of event-driven and object-oriented programming. 

The proposed event-driven programming associates one or more events with each element used. These events are displayed in the code editor. 

For many elements: 

- Some events are proposed by default: the most common and used events. 

- Some events can be added. These events allow you to manage specific cases (the drag and drop feature, for example). For more details, see [Optional events](../WDChamp/1014004.md).

### How to display events associated with an element?
<a name="how_display_events_associated_with_element_ELTPARAGRAPHE000026"></a>

There are several methods to display the events associated with an element (control, window, page, etc.): 

- **Use the F2 shortcut**. To do so, you must: 

	- Select the desired element. 

	- Press F2: the code editor is automatically displayed with the list of default associated events. 




- **Use the "Code" option in the context menu**. To do so, you must: 

	- Select the desired element. 

	- Right-click to open the context menu and select "Code". The code editor is automatically displayed with the list of default associated events. 







Remarks: 

- You can also display the events associated with an element from the element description window: simply click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Detail_Description_FEN_btnCode%20-%20HC%20N%B0001%201.gif), at the bottom of the description window. 

- To display the events associated with the project, a window, a page or a report, you can also use the open document tabs. Simply: 

	- Open the context menu of the desired element. 

	- Select "Element code" in the menu that appears. The code editor is automatically displayed with the list of default associated events.

### Special case: open the events associated with an element from the code editor
<a name="special_case_open_the_events_associated_with_element_from_the_code_editor_ELTPARAGRAPHE000058"></a>

The WLanguage code in the different processes or events can handle specific elements (controls, windows, pages, etc.). 

You can directly open the events of an element handled in a line of code by clicking the element and pressing F2. 

For example: For the following code: 

```wl
Open(WIN_Menu)
```
If F2 is pressed while on "WIN_Menu", the code editor will open the events associated with that window.

### Special case: F2 on the name of a plane
<a name="special_case_the_name_plane_ELTPARAGRAPHE000074"></a>

If the WLanguage code handles a named plane, you can press F2 while on the name of the plane to open the corresponding window and go to the specified plane.

### Tip: Return to last code modified
<a name="tip_return_last_code_modified_ELTPARAGRAPHE000083"></a>

Often, after writing a line of code, you navigate through the code to check certain elements. And then, you have to go back to that line of code to continue your task.

To return to the initial code, press Ctrl + Alt + Left arrow.
