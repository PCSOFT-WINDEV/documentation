<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000093"></a>
WEBDEV allows you to deploy site sections or individual pages. There is no need to update the entire site whenever a modification is performed.

The Web users is not disconnected when updating the page (and its dependencies).

2. Select "Deploy" from the popup menu.

3. The deployment of the page (and dependencies if necessary) is performed. The server used for deploying the page is the last server used during the last setup of the site (see [Deploying a site on a remote application server](../Editeurs/2028019.md)).

### Limitations

- Only the existing pages that have been modified can be deployed page by page. If new pages are added, the entire site must be redeployed.  

- If elements are added to the site (queries, reports, ...), the entire site must be redeployed.

- If a global code is modified, the entire site must be redeployed.
