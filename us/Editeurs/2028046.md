## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000199"></a>
The setup program creation wizard allows you to select the deployment profile to use. This profile contains the parameters of the application server as well as the parameters for site deployment.

You can:

- choose a profile that was created beforehand (when updating a site for example). In this case, the information regarding the profile is automatically taken into account. Simply validate this information.  

- create a new profile (during a first setup for example).

- choose no profile. In this case, the parameters of the deployment profile will be specified when installing the site (setup via package or via physical media).




For an update, you have the ability to create new profiles (in most cases, one profile per server) and to select them for the update. The site will be deployed on all the selected servers: 

- If the site is already installed on the server, the wizard will perform an update.

- If the site is not installed on the server, the server will perform a new setup.




**Remark**: If the setup fails on one of the servers, the setup continues normally on the other servers.

## Parameters of the application server

### Entering information on the application server
<a name="entering_information_the_application_server_ELTPARAGRAPHE000033"></a>

The following information must be specified: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Info_serveur.gif&type=thumb)


- Server address: name of computer accessible via the network, an IP address or an Internet address.
	In the case of an installation on a WEBDEV cluster, you must indicate the address of the proxy associated with the cluster. 

- Characteristics of the deployment account: Username and password (defined by the hosting manager in the Hosting Control Center).


Remark: Caution: the username can be preceded by the domain name to avoid confusions. For example: "mycomputer\\test" or "mydomain\\test".

Via "Advanced parameters", you can:

- Define the server parameters. 

- Define site parameters. 

- Specify how to transfer setup files: 

	- FTP. You can define the characteristics of the FTP server (port, IP address, transfer method).

	- HTTP (default mode, starting with version 25). 




- Specify the setup commands: 

	- use authenticated requests.

	- use the HTTPS protocol.

	- define (if necessary) the characteristics of the proxy.







For more details, see [Advanced parameters](#NOTE4_1).

"Test parameters" establishes a connection with the Web server and allows you to check that all the information entered is correct.

"Export server parameters" allows you to create an XML file with the server parameters. By default, this file is created in the "\\Personal\\WEBDEV servers" subdirectory of the WEBDEV setup directory. Therefore, the information regarding a server can be transmitted from a project to another one. The parameters can be imported via the "Import the parameters of a server" button.

## Parameters for deploying the site
<a name="parameters_for_deploying_the_site_ELTTEXTE000247"></a>
Then, the wizard allows you to enter the deployment parameters of the site. The following information must be specified: 

- ***The name of the site***. By default, this name corresponds to the name of the project. You can use a different name. This enables you to deploy several instances of the same project on the same server by giving them different site names. For example, the "REWALI" project can be deployed on a Web server:

	- as REWALI: this site is intended for the travel agency X1.

	- as RESA: this site is intended for the travel agency X2.




- ***The domain name of SiteMap file***. This parameter must be filled in the case where the name of the server used for deployment is different from the domain name used to access it. The SiteMap file is a file used by Google for referencing.

- ***The subdirectory containing the data files*** in HFSQL Classic format. The name of this subdirectory is linked to the site name. It corresponds to the name of the directory where the data files of the site are installed. This directory is a subdirectory of the data directory assigned by the host. This directory name should be modified only if several sites share the same data files.

- ***The name of the deployment profile***. This name will be given to the deployment profile in order to easily find it (when updating the site for example).




**Remark**: If you have specified some information in the advanced settings, this information is automatically retrieved.

## Advanced parameters
<a name="advanced_parameters_ELTTEXTE000271"></a>
The parameters for site deployment are as follows:

- ***The name of the deployment profile***. This name will be given to the deployment profile in order to easily find it (when updating the site for example).

- ***Server parameters*** ("General" tab): Application server address, Deployment account, System user account. These parameters are the ones specified in the previous screen: "Application server settings".

- ***the site parameters*** ("General" tab): 

	- ***Site deployment name***. By default, this name corresponds to the name of the project. You can use a different name. This enables you to deploy several instances of the same project on the same server by giving them different site names. For example, the "REWALI" project can be deployed on a Web server:

		- as REWALI: this site is intended for the travel agency X1.

		- as RESA: this site is intended for the travel agency X2.




- ***Domain name of SiteMap file***. This parameter must be filled in the case where the name of the server used for deployment is different from the domain name used to access it. The SiteMap file is a file used by Google for referencing.

- ***Directory containing the data files*** in HFSQL Classic format. The name of this subdirectory is linked to the site name. It corresponds to the name of the directory where the data files of the site are installed. This directory is a subdirectory of the data directory assigned by the host. This directory name should be modified only if several sites share the same data files.

- If the site must be deployed in all languages or only for certain languages (to be selected). 

- Transfer of setup files ("Advanced" tab):

	- Selecting the transfer method: 

		- HTTP

		- FTP




- When transferring by FTP, you can specify: 

	- The address of the FTP server, 

	- The FTP mode: Active or passive FTP

<a name="NOTE5_1"></a>


## Validation
<a name="validation_ELTTEXTE000295"></a>
If you have chosen to deploy the WEBDEV site on a remote WEBDEV Application Server, WEBDEV attempts to connect to the specified Web server (and to the specified FTP server if the deployment is done by FTP) when the site deployment parameters are validated.

An error message is displayed if a problem occurs. For more details, see: [Error when performing a setup by FTP](../Editeurs/2028057.md).
