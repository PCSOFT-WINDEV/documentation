## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000121"></a>
Android or iOS projects can use custom fonts. These fonts are not on the end user's device by default. 

It is therefore necessary to include these fonts before generating the application..

## Using custom fonts

### Default case
<a name="default_case_ELTPARAGRAPHE000018"></a>

By default, Android projects use Droid (Droid Sans, Droid Sans Mono and Droid Serif) and Roboto fonts in the editor. These fonts are automatically installed along with WINDEV Mobile on the development computer.

**Using native Android/iOS fonts at runtime**
The following fonts can be used:

- Droid Sans -> all Android versions

- Droid Sans Mono-> all Android versions

- Droid Serif -> all Android versions

- Roboto -> from Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich, api level 14)

- Roboto Condensed -> from Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean, api level 16)

- Roboto Light -> from Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean, api level 16)

- Roboto Thin -> from Android 4.2 (Jelly Bean MR1, api level 17)




You can choose other fonts installed on the development computer when defining the style of a control. 

If the device does not support the specified font at runtime, a substitution font will be used (Droid Sans or Roboto from Android 4.0). This can lead to display problems. 

Remark: If a custom font is used in the project, but has not yet been integrated, a UI error is displayed. 




### How to use specific fonts

To use specific fonts (in the editor and at runtime): 

1. Open the project description window: on the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, click "Description".

2. In the "Advanced" tab, click the "Project fonts" button. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Police_perso_WM%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)


3. In the window that is displayed, add the requested fonts ("Add" button used to add files in 'TTF" or "OTF" format). The files corresponding to the font will be copied to the "Fonts" subdirectory of the project. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Police_perso_WM%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif&type=thumb)

	**CAUTION**: You must have the necessary rights to distribute the selected fonts. 

4. Validate the different windows. The selected fonts will be available in the window editor, integrated into the Android and iOS applications and deployed. These fonts are also available in the report editor. Make sure that the added fonts support the charset used in your application and that they are redistributable. 




When selecting a font in the control style, the embedded fonts will appear both as a font available for the platform and as a custom font.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Police_perso_WM%20-%20HC%20N%B0004.gif&type=thumb)
