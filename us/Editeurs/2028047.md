## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000313"></a>
The setup creation wizard allows you to specify the setup directory. 

In the "Setup directory" step of wizard, you have the ability to specify: 

- [the basic setting](#NOTE2_1), 

- [the advanced setting](#NOTE3_1), 

- [the implementation of UAC for the installer](#NOTE4_1).

## Basic setting
<a name="basic_setting_ELTTEXTE000337"></a>


### Default path of setup on the end-user computer
<a name="default_path_setup_the_enduser_computer_ELTPARAGRAPHE000031"></a>

The setup configuration is used to select the setup directory proposed by default. The user will be able to modify this directory when installing the application.

This directory is "C:\\Program Files\\&lt;ApplicationName&gt;" by default.


### Default path of reference setup (network setup only)
<a name="default_path_reference_setup_network_setup_only_ELTPARAGRAPHE000040"></a>

The setup configuration is used to select the setup directory of reference setup proposed by default. The user will be able to modify this directory when installing the application.

This path is optional. 

<a name="NOTE3"></a>
<a name="NOTE3_1"></a>


## Advanced setting of setup directory
<a name="advanced_setting_setup_directory_ELTTEXTE000367"></a>
To access the advanced setting regarding the setup of your application, click the "Advanced" button.

These advanced parameters are used to:

- [Allow the user to save the replaced files](#NOTE3_2).

- [Run a program at the end of setup](#NOTE3_3).

- [Configure a silent setup](#NOTE3_Silent).

- [Modify the identifier used to uninstall the application](#NOTE3_4).

- [Modify or create the "AutoExec.BAT" file](#NOTE3_5).

- [Modify or create the ".INI" files](#NOTE3_6).

- [Modify or create values in the registry](#NOTE3_7).



<a name="NOTE3_2"></a>


### Allow the user to save the replaced files
<a name="allow_the_user_save_the_replaced_files_ELTPARAGRAPHE000082"></a>

When updating an application, an additional plane can be included in the setup program. This additional plane allows the user to save the replaced files in a backup directory. This backup directory will be named "Backup_&lt;BackupDate&gt;_&lt;BackupTime&gt;" by default.

![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Info_affiches_install%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.gif)


This backup can be used if the setup fails for example. To use this backup, the user will have to copy the files found in the backup directory into the setup directory of application.

The backup of replaced files is proposed by default to the users.
<a name="NOTE3_3"></a>


### Run a program at the end of setup
<a name="run_program_the_end_setup_ELTPARAGRAPHE000095"></a>

By default, the setup program proposes to the user to run the application executable at the end of setup. The option "Start the program" is checked. The executable is automatically run when clicking the "Done" button.

The setup program creation wizard allows you to specify the executable that must be run and to associate parameters with this executable. Only an executable (".EXE" file) can be run.

The executable to run corresponds to:

- the name and full path of the executable file. The following keywords can be used:

	- **&lt;SetupDir&gt;**: setup directory chosen by the user during the setup.

	- **&lt;SetupDrive&gt;**: drive of the setup directory chosen by the user during the setup.

	- **&lt;SetupFile&gt;**: setup directory of data files. The setup program creation wizard allows you to configure this directory. For more details, see [Configuring the directory of data files](../Editeurs/2028045.md).

	- **&lt;WinDir&gt;**: Windows directory of user computers

	- **&lt;SysDir&gt;**: system directory.

	- **&lt;RefDir&gt;**: reference directory for the setups with automatic update only.




- the runtime parameters of the program installed (if necessary).




For example: "&lt;SetupDir&gt;\\MyApp.EXE /Param".

Remark: If modifications are performed in the "AutoExec.Bat" file, no program should be run at the end of the setup. Indeed, the modifications performed in this file will be taken into account when the computer is restarted.
<a name="NOTE3_Silent"></a>


### Configure a silent setup
<a name="configure_silent_setup_ELTPARAGRAPHE000125"></a>

The setups of reference version and client version can be performed in silent mode. In this case, the setup will be done without any user intervention. The options defined by default will be automatically used. 

The available options are: 

- **Silent client setup**: the application setup for the end user does not require any user action. 

- **Silent deployment of reference version** (available during a setup with automatic update): the reference version of network setup will be installed without any user intervention.  



<a name="NOTE3_4"></a>


### Modify the identifier used to uninstall the application
<a name="modify_the_identifier_used_uninstall_the_application_ELTPARAGRAPHE000137"></a>

If you have chosen to allow your application to be uninstalled, a specific identifier is automatically created in the registry. This identifier can be modified via the setup program creation wizard.

By default, this identifier is "&lt;ApplicationNameWithoutSpace&gt;". For example, "WDCustomer" for the "WD Customer" application. This identifier may (or may not) contain space characters.

This identifier will be created in the key:

- "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall" in Windows 2000 and NT.

- "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall" in Windows 98 and Me.



<a name="NOTE3_5"></a>


### Modify or create the "AutoExec.BAT" file
<a name="modify_create_the_autoexecbat_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000151"></a>

You have the ability to modify or create the "AutoExec.BAT" file on the setup computers. This file will be modified or created (if necessary) when the computer is restarted. In this case, a reboot is automatically proposed at the end of the application setup.

The "AutoExec.BAT" file is used to:

- add the directory of the application executable into the PATH.

- start the application when starting the setup computer.

- ...




Reminders:

- The "AutoExec.BAT" file is automatically run when the computer is started.

- The PATH lists the directories in which the executables (".EXE" files) and the libraries ("DLL" files) are sought in priority.



<a name="NOTE3_6"></a>


### Modify or create the ".INI" files
<a name="modify_create_the_ini_files_ELTPARAGRAPHE000169"></a>

When installing a WINDEV application, you have the ability to modify or create the ".INI" files on the setup computers. These files will be associated with the application installed.

The ".INI" files are used to:

- customize the application according to the connected user.

- define the default parameters of the application.

- ...




Then, the ".INI" files can be read and modify from the application directly ([INIRead](../WDLang1/3013043.md) and [INIWrite](../WDLang1/3013039.md)).

**Example of modification**
For example, to save the setup program runtime language to the "MyAppli.INI" file (in the application setup directory):

- ".INI" file: &lt;SetupDir&gt;\\MyApp.INI

- Section: LANGUAGE

- Parameter: LANGUAGE_INSTALL

- Value: &lt;Language&gt;




The **&lt;Language&gt;** keyword will be automatically replaced during the setup by the number of the runtime language of the setup program (this number can be used by [Nation](../WDLang1/3054014.md)).

In this example, if the number of the runtime language is 3, the following parameter will be added into the "MyApp.INI" file: 


```txt
[LANGUAGE]
LANGUAGE_INSTALL=3
```

<a name="NOTE3_7"></a>


### Modify or create values in the registry
<a name="modify_create_values_the_registry_ELTPARAGRAPHE000208"></a>

When installing a WINDEV application, you have the ability to modify or create entries in the registry.

The registry alloows you to:

- customize the application according to the connected user.

- define the default parameters of the application.

- ...




Then the registry can be read and modified from the application directly ([RegistrySetValue](../WDLang1/3065006.md), [RegistryQueryValue](../WDLang1/3065012.md), ...).

Example of modification
For example, to save the runtime language of the setup program in the registry, type:

- Key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\MyCompany\\MyApp\\1.0\\

- Name: Language

- Value: &lt;Language&gt;


The **&lt;Language&gt;** keyword will be automatically replaced during the setup by the number of the runtime language of the setup program (this number can be used by [Nation](../WDLang1/3054014.md)).

## Implementing the UAC for the installer
<a name="implementing_the_uac_for_the_installer_ELTTEXTE000433"></a>
By default, installing a WINDEV application triggers the UAC.

To access the setting regarding the implementation of UAC, click the "Implementing the UAC" button.

The window that is displayed allows you to modify this operating mode via "The installer DOES NOT require the administrator rights": 

- for the individual setups: the UAC is disabled for the setup on the end-user computer. 

- for the network setups with automatic update. In this case, the UAC can be disabled: 

	- for the installer of the end user, 

	- for the installer of the reference version, 

	- for both. 







Caution: The option "Does not require the administrator rights" involves some limitations: no files can be installed in the system directories (Program Files, Windows...), no system files and parameters can be modified (win.ini, path, etc.). 

The setup will fail if the rights are not sufficient. Whenever possible, the setup wizard will guide the user in his choices so that he can install the application. 

Remark: The implementation of the UAC for the installer can also be configured in the [advanced options of the installer](../Editeurs/2028108.md). These options are accessible in the "Medium" step of the setup creation wizard.
