## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000086"></a>
To simplify the positioning of controls, you have the ability to force their move according to the four main axes (0°, 45°, 90°, 135°).

Therefore, a control can be moved while staying on a given line (to be aligned with a background image for example).

This feature comes in addition to the mechanism of [automatic magnetism](../Editeurs/2022002.md) found in the page editor and in the window editor.

## How to?
<a name="how_ELTTEXTE000110"></a>
To move a control or a group of controls found in a window, in a page or in a report:

1. Select the controls to move.

2. Start the move with the mouse.

3. Press the Alt key while moving. The controls will be automatically positioned on the nearest axis (horizontal, vertical or oblique) and they will stay on this axis as long as the Alt key remains pressed down.

## Remark

The anchored move has priority over the [snap-on grid](../Editeurs/2022002.md) when the two mechanisms are used to help positioning a control.
