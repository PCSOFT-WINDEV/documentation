## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000107"></a>
The compilation options allow you to define the help system generation settings. There are various settings:

- Name of the help file to generate.

- Compiler to use.

- Compilation settings for the selected compiler.

## Name of the generated help file
<a name="name_the_generated_help_file_ELTTEXTE000131"></a>
The name of the help file generated by WINDEV can be different from the name of the help system. For example, in a multilingual application, different help files will be created and generated from the same WINDEV help system (WDH file).

In this case, the name of a help file can contain several elements:

- **the base name of the help file**. The name specified in the help system properties is suggested by default: on the "Modification" tab, in the "Help system" group, click "Description". It can be modified in the generation settings. 

- **the suffix of the generated files**. This suffix can correspond to: 

	- No suffix: the name of the generated file is the base name of the help file. 

	- Number of the language used in the files. This number is used by the [Nation](../WDLang1/3054014.md) function.

	- The language identifier (US for English).

## Compilation settings

The compilation settings depend on the selected compiler.
