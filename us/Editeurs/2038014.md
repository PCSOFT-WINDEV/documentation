## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000081"></a>
When working on a laptop computer or on an offline computer, you may want to continue to work:

- on the data found in the Control Centers (schedule management, quality management, ...).

- on the shared projects in the SCM database.




WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile allow you to manage an "Offline" mode for the Control Centers and for the projects in the SCM. This mode is used to:

- **for the Control Centers**: disconnect from the database of Control Centers and copy this database locally onto the computer. Your data remains accessible even in offline mode. 
	During the reconnection, the data modified locally is automatically updated on the network database. If a conflict occurs (task modified by several users for example), the network database has priority over the other computers. 
	For more details, see [Working in offline mode with the Control Centers](../Editeurs/3540709.md).

- **for the SCM**: disconnect from the SCM database and use the project locally. Your data remains accessible even in offline mode. 
	During the reconnection, the data modified and not checked out from the SCM before the disconnection will be automatically checked out and updated. Your modifications can be checked back into the SCM.
	For more details, see [Working in offline mode with SCM](../Editeurs/2038013.md).
