<a name="editing_the_css_style_sheet_project_ELTTEXTE000165"></a>
To edit the CSS style sheet of a project:

1. On the "Page" tab, in the "Skin and styles" group, expand "Styles" and select "Edit CSS styles".

2. The list of CSS styles found in the project is displayed. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Edition-StyleCSS.gif&type=thumb)





This window is used to:

- Modify the selected style. If the style is not a local style, this modification will be applied to all the controls that use this style.

- Create a new style.

- Duplicate selected style.

- Delete the selected style: in this case, the style associated with the control will be the same but it will be local to the control.




**Remark**: The "Local" check box returns the list of styles associated with the style sheet associated with the page ("Style" tab of the page description).

## Defining the default CSS styles
<a name="defining_the_default_css_styles_ELTTEXTE000189"></a>
The default CSS styles are the CSS styles that will be used by default when creating a new control.

For a given type of control, if no WEBDEV style is found in the project, you have the ability to define one or more default CSS styles (depending on the type of control).

**To define the default CSS styles of a project**:

1. On the "Page" tab, in the "Skin and styles" group, expand "Styles" and select "Define default CSS styles". The list of CSS styles found in the project is displayed as well as the list of controls.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Styles_CSS_Defaut.gif&type=thumb)


2. Select a CSS style. Depending on the selected style:

	- In the list of controls, the types of controls with a red background are the ones for which another CSS style was defined by default.

	- In the list of controls, the types of controls with a blue background are the ones for which the selected CSS style was defined by default.

	- In the list of controls, the lines associated with the current style are displayed in green.




3. Select the controls to which this style must be associated by default (the list of controls is multi-selection).
	**Caution**:

	- Select the other types that use this style. Otherwise, the other associations of this style will be lost.

	- The "Validate" button validates the selection.




4. Click the [Validate] button.




**Remark**: You can also modify, create, delete or duplicate a style from the list.
