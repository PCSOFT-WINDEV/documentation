## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000086"></a>
During a network setup, a reference setup is found on one or more reference servers. The users install their application from the reference server.

**This step of the wizard allows you to manage automatic application updates from the reference server**.

These parameters can be modified when the application is installed on the reference server (to do so, check "These parameters can be modified during the deployment on the server").

## Frequency for checking the availability of updates
<a name="frequency_for_checking_the_availability_updates_ELTTEXTE000110"></a>
By default, the availability of an update on the server is checked whenever the application is started. This check frequency can be configured. It can be performed: 

- Whenever the application is started. 

- Every X days.

## Interactions with the user when checking the availability of updates
<a name="interactions_with_the_user_when_checking_the_availability_updates_ELTTEXTE000134"></a>
Whenever it is started, an application installed via a network setup checks whether an update is available on the reference server. 

- If a more recent version is available on the server, the application update is proposed to the end user. 

- If there is no network connection when opening the application, a warning message is displayed by default. 
	This message can be useless for an application used on a mobile device, connected intermittently. In this case, simply select "Silent check: Don't inform the user". <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Install_silencieuse.gif)
