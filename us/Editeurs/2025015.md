## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000081"></a>
Windows Vista (and later) proposes several improvements. These improvements bring some modifications regarding the programming, the creation of the executable or the applications installed.

Among the improvements that must be taken into account:

- The User Account Control (UAC)

- The manager of Windows Mobile device, required to synchronize the Mobile devices.

## UAC and executable creation
<a name="uac_and_executable_creation_ELTTEXTE000105"></a>
To increase security against worms and viruses, Windows Vista/7 implemented the UAC (User Account Control) mechanism.

By default, this mechanism considers that all the users (including the administrators) are standard users with reduced rights.

To run an application that requires additional rights, the UAC mechanism asks for confirmation.

For more details on this system, and the consequences for your executables, see [The UAC mechanism](../Editeurs/2025014.md).
