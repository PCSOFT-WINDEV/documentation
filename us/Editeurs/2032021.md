## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000123"></a>
The query editor allows you to optimize the execution speed of one or more queries.

The optimization of a query is based on the following principle: a wizard defines the composite keys to modify and/or to add into the analysis associated with the project.|   |   |   |

| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ER.png)<br> | Important | [Reports & Queries](../Presentation/3088004.md) cannot be used to optimize the execution speed of query. |

## How to?

### Optimizing the execution speed of current query
<a name="optimizing_the_execution_speed_current_query_ELTPARAGRAPHE000033"></a>

To optimize the execution speed of current query: 

1. On the "Query" tab, in the "Analyze" group, click "Optimize the query".

2. The window for query optimization is displayed and it proposes the different modifications that can be performed in the analysis.

### Optimizing the execution speed of one or more queries

To optimize the execution speed of one or more queries: 

1. On the "Query" tab, in the "Analyze" group, click "Optimize the query".

2. The window for query optimization is displayed and it proposes the different modifications that can be performed in the analysis.




**Caution**: Adding a large number of composite keys to the analysis increases the index file size and may slow down the access to data files.

**Remark**: This option is available only if the following conditions are fulfilled:

- the Live Data is enabled: on the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, click "Description". Select the "Live Data" tab and check "Enable the Live Data". For more details, see [Live Data](../Editeurs/2021005.md).

- the data files are found in the test directory of project: on the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, click "Description". Select the "Files" tab. For more details, see [Testing a project](../Editeurs/2019017.md).

### Optimization and composite keys
<a name="optimization_and_composite_keys_ELTPARAGRAPHE000070"></a>

To optimize your queries, the editor proposes the creation of composite keys. The order of components in the composite key is not important.

There is no need to create a new key that just reverses the order of components found in an existing key.
