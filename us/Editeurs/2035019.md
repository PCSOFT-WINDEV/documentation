## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000081"></a>
A deployment diagram shows the physical layout of the hardware components (nodes) used in a system as well as the association between the executable programs and these components.

For example, the diagram below shows the different hardware components used in a company:

## Elements of a deployment diagram
<a name="elements_deployment_diagram_ELTTEXTE000105"></a>
A deployment diagram includes the following elements:

- **node class**: represents a class of a physical resource. For example: server, PC, printer, etc.

- **node instance**: represents a physical resource. For example: server 3, printer 70, etc.

- **connexion**: represents communication between two nodes. For example: ISDN or TCP/IP link.

- **package**: divides and organizes the diagram representation (in the same way that directories organize files).
