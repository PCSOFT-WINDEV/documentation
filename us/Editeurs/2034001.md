To discover all the SQL commands (functions, clauses, operators, etc.) that can be used in an SQL query managed by HFSQL, see [Commands that can be used in an SQL query managed by HFSQL](../Editeurs/2034006.md).



**Remarks**: 

- These statements can be used:

	- in the SQL code of queries created in the query editor. Then, these queries will be run by [HExecuteQuery](../WDLang4/3044080.md).

	- in the SQL code of queries run by [HExecuteSQLQuery](../WDLang4/3044084.md).




- The " character can be used as an identifier delimiter in SQL queries as specified by the SQL92 standard.

## SELECT
<a name="select_ELTTEXTE001079"></a>


### SELECT
<a name="select_ELTPARAGRAPHE000110"></a>

The **SELECT** statement is used to find records in one or more files. 

**Format**:


```txt
SELECT [ALL/DISTINCT] NamesOfItems AS NameOfItemsUsed
FROM FileName AS UsedFileName
[WHERE FileJoins [AND] SelectionConditions]
[GROUP BY NameOfItems [HAVING Condition]]
[ORDER BY NameOfItems]
```


**Example**: The following SQL code is used to display the total sum of orders per customer living in Paris. The result will be grouped by customer name, by zip code and by city. Only the customers with a total amount of orders exceeding 3000 Dollars will be considered. The result will be sorted by total order amount in ascending order:


```sql
SELECT CUSTOMER.CustomerLastName AS CustomerLastName,
CUSTOMER.ZipCode AS ZipCode,
CUSTOMER.City AS City,
SUM(ORDERS.TotalIOT) AS TotalIOT
FROM CUSTOMER AS CUST, ORDERS AS ORD
WHERE CUST.CustomerNum = ORD.CustomerNum
AND ZipCode LIKE '75%'
GROUP BY CustomerLastName, ZipCode, City
HAVING TotalIOT > 3000
ORDER BY TotalIOT ASC
```


**Remarks**:

- The  **DISTINCT** keyword deletes the duplicate records from the query result.

- For more details on selection conditions, see [Selection conditions in an SQL query](../Editeurs/2034008.md).

- A Select query can be created in the query editor. For more details, see [Creating a select query](../Editeurs/2032062.md).

- In the syntax of the SELECT statement, the NameOfItems parameter can contain one or more selection conditions. For example: 
	
	```sql
	SELECT CustomerLastName, Age>18 AS Adult FROM Customer
	```







- The **SELECT** statement can be used as a scalar expression, which means that the **SELECT** statement can be used instead a value or a column in the statements such as **INSERT**, **UPDATE**, **SELECT**, etc. 
	For example: 
	
	```sql
	INSERT INTO table (name, value) VALUES ( 'Rome a Rick', 
	       (SELECT MAX(number) FROM table2) )
	```

	
	```sql
	UPDATE customer SET gdttl = (SELECT sum(invoice.grand_total) 
	       FROM invoice WHERE invoice.reference=customer.reference)
	```

	
	```sql
	SELECT NamesOfItems AS NameOfItemsUsed,
	       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Table2 WHERE Item=NameOfItemsUsed)
	       FROM Table1
	```





Remark: The SELECT query used as scalar expression must return a result on a single column and a single row.


### Special case: Multi-file SELECT
<a name="special_case_multifile_select_ELTPARAGRAPHE000156"></a>

The SELECT statement can also be used to select in a multi-file query all the columns of a data file via the following syntax: 


```sql
SELECT Order_Line.*,Orders.OrderNum, ...
FROM Orders, Order_Line
```


This syntax is very useful for joins and avoids entering the name of each item, which is a long and tedious operation. 


### Special cases: SELECT without FROM or SELECT using a virtual table
<a name="special_cases_select_without_from_select_using_virtual_table_ELTPARAGRAPHE000167"></a>

The SELECT statement can also be used to run queries that do not apply to tables: 

- by using the syntax without "FROM" clause. 
	Example: 
	
	```sql
	SELECT TO_CHAR(12,'RN')
	```


- by using the virtual DUAL table. This virtual table contains a single item (named "dummy") and a single record. 
	Example: 
	
	```sql
	SELECT CURRENT_DATE FROM DUAL
	```






### Running a stored procedure
<a name="running_stored_procedure_ELTPARAGRAPHE000183"></a>

The SELECT statement can also be used to run stored procedures directly. 

The following syntax is used to run the stored procedure: 


```txt
SELECT NameOfStoredProcedure(NumericParameter,'StringParameter',....) [FROM DUAL]
```


Remarks: 

- The stored procedure must be a stored function: it must always return a value. Otherwise, a runtime error will occur. 

- If the name of the stored procedure is identical to the name of a function or procedure found in the project, its name must be prefixed by the name of the set of stored procedures. 

- The result of a stored procedure can also be one of the parameters of a SELECT query. 




For more details, see [Stored procedures and queries (HFSQL Client/Server)](../WDLang4/3044360.md).

## INSERT
<a name="insert_ELTTEXTE001121"></a>


### INSERT
<a name="insert_ELTPARAGRAPHE000207"></a>

The **INSERT** statement is used to add : 

- one record to a data file. 

- multiple records to a data file.




It uses the following format:


```txt
INSERT INTO FileName (NameOfItems)
VALUES (ValueItems add 1), (ValueItems add 2), ... , (ValueItems add N)
```


**Examples**: The following SQL code lets you insert:

- a new customer in the CUSTOMER file (the complete customer information is provided). 
	
	```sql
	INSERT INTO CUSTOMER
	VALUES (77, 'Moore', 'Julia', '1 rue Giono',...
	'69000', 'Lyon')
	```


- a new customer in the CUSTOMER file: only the customer's number, last name and first name are provided:
	
	```sql
	INSERT INTO CUSTOMER (CustomerNum, CustomerLastName, CustomerFirstName)
	VALUES (77, 'Moore', 'Julia')
	```


- 3 products in a PRODUCT file: 
	
	```sql
	INSERT INTO PRODUCT
	VALUES ('Ref01', 'Mineral water'), ('Ref02', 'Butter'), ('Ref03', 'Sponge')
	```





**Remarks**:

- An Insert query can be created in the query editor. For more details, see [Creating an insert query](../Editeurs/2032058.md).

- To get the value of the automatic identifier in an INSERT query on HFSQL files (query run by [HExecuteSQLQuery](../WDLang4/3044084.md), [HExecuteQuery](../WDLang4/3044080.md) or [SQLExec](../WDLang4/3072007.md)), use the SQL.IDAuto variable.

- The INSERT command cannot be used to copy data from one HFSQL file to another.

- The [H.NbRecModificationQuery](../WDLang4/3087002.md) variable is used to find out the number of inserted records.



<a name="NOTE3_2"></a>


### INSERT with selection
<a name="insert_with_selection_ELTPARAGRAPHE000259"></a>The **INSERT** statement can also be used to insert a selection of records made by a SELECT query. Its use format becomes:


```txt
INSERT INTO FileName [(NameOfItems)] SELECT...
```
**Remarks**:

- The number of items to insert must be identical to the number of values returned by the SELECT query.

- All the files items are taken into account if no item is specified in the INSERT statement.

- This type of query cannot be created in the query editor.




<a name="NOTE4"></a>
<a name="NOTE4_1"></a>


## UPDATE
<a name="update_ELTTEXTE001151"></a>
The ** UPDATE** statement is used to update the records in a file. It uses the following format:


```txt
UPDATE FileName
SET NameOfItem = Expression
[WHERE Conditions]
```

**Examples**: 

- The following SQL code is used to modify the title and the name of the customer named Montgomery:
	
	```sql
	UPDATE CUSTOMER
	SET Title = 'Mrs',
	CustomerLastName = 'Darwin'
	WHERE CustomerLastName = 'Montgomery'
	```


- The following SQL code modifies the client name in the Customer file. For records with the same ID, the name of the client in the Customer file is replaced with the name in the Customer_Svg file:
	
	```sql
	UPDATE CUSTOMER, CUSTOMER_SVG
	SET CUSTOMER.Name = CUSTOMER_SVG.Name
	WHERE CUSTOMER.ID = CUSTOMER_SVG.ID
	```





**Notes** about the use of the **UPDATE** statement in WINDEV:

- The WHERE clause accepts the sub-selections (by SELECT), if the sub-selection is relative to another file.

- The **SET** expression accepts no sub-selection (no SELECT command just after **SET**). Similarly, no join can be performed in the UPDATE section of the query.
	The following query is accepted:
	
	```sql
	UPDATE PRODUCT SET SalesPrice = 1000
	WHERE ProductRef IN (SELECT ORDERS.ProductRef FROM ORDERS) 
	-- Sub-query in WHERE: OK
	```

	The following query **is not accepted**:
	
	```sql
	UPDATE Product 
	SET SalesPrice = (SELECT AVG(ORDERS.UnitPrice) FROM ORDERS 
	-- Sub-query in SET: NOT VALID
	WHERE ORDERS.ProductRef = PRODUCT.ProductRef
	GROUP BY ORDERS.ProductRef)
	WHERE ProductRef IN (SELECT ORDERS.ProductRef FROM ORDERS)
	```

	Similarly, the following query **is not accepted**:
	
	```sql
	UPDATE Article INNER JOIN PRODUCT ON (Article.ArticleID = Product.ProductID)
	 -- Join in UPDATE: NOT VALID
	SET Article.SalesPrice = Product.SalesPrice
	WHERE ProductRef IN (SELECT ORDERS.ProductRef FROM ORDERS)
	```


- An Update query can be directly created in the query editor. For more details, see [Creating an update query](../Editeurs/2032057.md).

- The quote is used as delimiter for the strings in the SQL queries. If the value to write must contain a quote, this value must be preceded by the **backslash** character ('\\'). For example:
	
	```sql
	UPDATE CUSTOMER
	SET Address = 'Rue de l\'écluse'
	WHERE CustomerLastName = 'Montgomery'
	```


- The [H.NbRecModificationQuery](../WDLang4/3087002.md) variable is used to find out the number of updated records.




<a name="NOTE5"></a>
<a name="NOTE5_1"></a>


## DELETE
<a name="delete_ELTTEXTE001175"></a>
The **DELETE** statement is used to delete records from a file. It uses the following format:


```txt
DELETE FROM FileName
WHERE Conditions
```


**Example**: The following SQL code is used to delete the customers born between 01/01/1971 and 01/01/1975:


```sql
DELETE FROM CUSTOMER
WHERE CUSTOMER.DateOfBirth BETWEEN '19710101' AND '19750101'
```


**Remark**: A Delete query can be created in the query editor. For more details, see [Creating a delete query](../Editeurs/2032047.md).

<a name="NOTE6"></a>
<a name="NOTE6_1"></a>


## CREATE TABLE
<a name="create_table_ELTTEXTE001199"></a>
The CREATE TABLE statement is used to describe and create a table. It uses the following format:


```txt
CREATE TABLE TableName
(
	Description of item1,
	Description of item2,
	 ...
	Description Index1,
	Description Index2,
	 ...
)
```


In this syntax:

- the "Description of item" parameters correspond to:
	
	```txt
	ItemName type  [DEFAULT 'value' | DEFAULT NULL] [NOT NULL] 
	   [UNIQUE] [PRIMARY KEY]  [AUTO_INCREMENT] [COMMENT 'caption'] [COLLATE 'language']
	```
 where:

	- **ItemName**: name that will be given to the item. 

	- **Type**: Type of item (chosen among the available types presented below). 

	- **DEFAULT**: defines the default value of the item. 

	- **NOT NULL**: prevents from assigning the NULL value to the item. 

	- **UNIQUE**: defines an item with or without duplicates. 

	- **PRIMARY KEY**: defines a primary key. 

	- **AUTO_INCREMENT**: defines an automatic identifier for items of type Integer.

	- **COMMENT**: defines the caption of the item.

	- **COLLATE**: defines the language for sorting the item (for example: 'EN_US').




- the "Description of index" parameters correspond to:
	
	```txt
	INDEX IndexName ( itm1 [ASC | DESC] [CI] [AI] [PI], itm2 ... ) [UNIQUE]
	```
 where:

	- **ASC and DESC**: are used to define the sort direction. 

	- **CI**: specifies that the case is ignored.

	- **AI**: specifies that accented characters are ignored.

	- **PI**: specifies that the punctuation is ignored.







**Remark**: This type of query cannot be created with the wizard found in the query editor.

<a name="CREATEAS"></a>
<a name="CREATEAS_1"></a>


## CREATE TABLE AS
<a name="create_table_ELTTEXTE001229"></a>
The CREATE TABLE AS statement describes a table and creates it from the result of a select query. The table columns have the names and types of data associated with the columns after the SELECT query has been run.

It uses the following format:


```txt
CREATE TABLE TableName AS SelectQuery [WITH NO DATA]
```
In this syntax: 

- SelectQuery is a SELECT query. The query is run and the table is created from the result of this Select query. 

- The "WITH NO DATA" option is used to create the table structure only (without the data found in the result of the Select query). 




Caution: The index of the created table may differ from the one of the source table. 

**Remark**: This type of query cannot be created with the wizard found in the query editor.

<a name="NOTE7"></a>
<a name="NOTE7_1"></a>


## DROP TABLE
<a name="drop_table_ELTTEXTE001253"></a>
The DROP TABLE statement is used to physically delete a table. It uses the following format:


```txt
DROP TABLE [ IF EXISTS ] name [, ...]
```


**Remarks**:

- IF EXISTS is used to avoid returning an error if the table does not exist.

- This type of query cannot be created with the wizard found in the query editor.




<a name="NOTE8"></a>
<a name="NOTE8_1"></a>


## ALTER TABLE
<a name="alter_table_ELTTEXTE001277"></a>
The ALTER TABLE statement is used to change the structure of an existing table. You can add or delete columns and indexes, change the type of the existing columns and rename the columns or the table. It uses the following format:


```txt
ALTER TABLE TableName Action [, Action]....
```


In this syntax: 

- the "Action" parameters correspond to one of the following actions:
	
	```txt
	ADD [COLUMN] Description of item
	ADD [COLUMN] (Description of item1 [,Description of item2]....)		
	DROP [COLUMN] [IF EXISTS] ItemName	
	DROP [COLUMN] [IF EXISTS] (NameItem1 [, NameItem2]...)	
	ALTER [COLUMN] ItemName [SET DATA] TYPE alter_type_desc	
	ALTER [COLUMN] ItemName SET DEFAULT <value>	
	ALTER [COLUMN] ItemName DROP DEFAULT
	ADD [UNIQUE / PRIMARY KEY] INDEX [<IndexName>] (Description of index
				 [, Description of index2], ...)
	DROP INDEX [IF EXISTS] IndexName			
	DROP INDEX [IF EXISTS] (NameIndex1 [, NameIndex2]...)	
	RENAME COLUMN ItemName TO New_ItemName
	```





- The "Description of item" parameters correspond to:
	
	```txt
	ItemName type  [DEFAULT 'value' | DEFAULT NULL] [NOT NULL] [UNIQUE] [PRIMARY KEY]
	  [AUTO_INCREMENT] [COMMENT 'caption'] [COLLATE 'language']
	```
 where:

	- **ItemName**: name that will be given to the item. 

	- **Type**: Type of item (chosen among the types presented above). 

	- **DEFAULT**: defines the default value of the item. 

	- **NOT NULL**: prevents from assigning the NULL value to the item. 

	- **UNIQUE**: defines an item with or without duplicates. 

	- **PRIMARY KEY**: defines a primary key. 

	- **AUTO_INCREMENT**: defines an automatic identifier for items of type Integer.

	- **COMMENT**: defines the caption of the item.

	- **COLLATE**: defines the language for sorting the item (for example: 'EN_US').

	- **SECUREPASSWORD**: is used to determine that the item is of type "Password". 




- the "Description of index" parameters correspond to:
	
	```txt
	ItemName [ASC | DESC] [CI] [AI] [PI]
	```
 where:

	- **ASC and DESC**: are used to define the sort direction. 

	- **CI**: specifies that the case is ignored.

	- **AI**: specifies that accented characters are ignored.

	- **PI**: specifies that the punctuation is ignored.







**Remarks**: 

- This type of query cannot be created with the wizard found in the query editor.

- To use the modified table with ALTER (without an analysis related to the project), use [HDeclareExternal](../WDLang4/3044204.md) after the ALTER TABLE query is executed.




<a name="NOTE9"></a>
<a name="NOTE9_1"></a>


## CREATE INDEX
<a name="create_index_ELTTEXTE001301"></a>
The CREATE INDEX statement (equivalent to the ALTER TABLE statement) is used to create indexes. This statement is used to add indexes to an existing table. It uses the following format:


```txt
CREATE [UNIQUE] INDEX [IndexName] ON TableName (Description of index [, Description of index]... )
```


In this code, the "Description of index" parameters correspond to:


```txt
ItemName [ASC | DESC] [CI] [AI] [PI]
```
where:

- **ASC and DESC**: are used to define the sort direction. 

- **CI**: specifies that the case is ignored.

- **AI**: specifies that accented characters are ignored.

- **PI**: specifies that the punctuation is ignored.




**Remark**: This type of query cannot be created with the wizard found in the query editor.

You have the ability to use the CREATE INDEX statement on a materialized view. In this case, the TableName parameter corresponds to the name of a materialized view. If the view is refreshed, the indexes are automatically updated: there is no need to re-create the indexes.

**Example:** Creating a materialized view and a composite key on this view. 


```sql
-- Creating a materialized view
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW MyMaterializedView AS 
	SELECT    
    	 Customer.State, Customr.Disp, Customer.MemberType, COUNT(*) AS Qty 
 	FROM Customer  
 	WHERE Customer.Balance>0 AND Customer.Type=2  
 	AND Customer.Family IN ('A', 'D', 'O')  
 	GROUP BY Customer.State, Customer.Disp, Customer.MemberType; 
	--';' to be able to use another SQL statement after
	--With a composite key
CREATE INDEX compkey ON MyMaterializedView (State ASC CI AI PI,
			Disp ASC CI AI PI,MemberType ASC)
```


<a name="NOTE17"></a>
<a name="NOTE17_1"></a>


## DROP INDEX
<a name="drop_index_ELTTEXTE001325"></a>
The DROP INDEX statement is used to physically delete an index from a table. It uses the following format:


```txt
DROP INDEX  [ IF EXISTS ] NameIndex ON NameTable
```


where **IF EXISTS**: prevents returning an error if the index does not exist.

**Remark**: This type of query cannot be created with the wizard found in the query editor.





<a name="NOTE10"></a>
<a name="NOTE10_1"></a>


## GRANT
<a name="grant_ELTTEXTE001349"></a>
GRANT queries are used to grant rights on an HFSQL server. This statement is equivalent to setting the element as *hAllowed*. It uses the following format:

- Grant the requested rights on the specified tables to the specified users: 
	
	```txt
	GRANT right[, right[, ... ]] ON [TABLE] table [, table [, ...]]  
				TO user [, user [, ...]]
	```


- Grant the requested rights on the specified databases to the specified users:.
	
	```txt
	GRANT right[, right[, ... ]] ON DATABASE database [, database [, ...]] 
				TO user [, user [, ...]]
	```


- Grant the requested rights on the server.
	
	```txt
	GRANT right[, right[, ... ]] 
				TO user [, user [, ...]]
	```





**Remark**: 

- This type of query cannot be created with the wizard found in the query editor.

- These queries cannot be used on an HFSQL Classic database, nor on a database accessed via Native Connectors.

## REVOKE
<a name="revoke_ELTTEXTE001373"></a>
The REVOKE queries are used to remove rights (switch the rights to hInherit) on an HFSQL server. It uses the following format:

- Set the requested rights as inherited on the specified tables for the specified users.
	
	```txt
	REVOKE right[, right [, ... ]] ON [TABLE] table [, table [, ...]]  
				FROM user [, user [, ...]]
	```


- Set the requested rights as inherited on the specified databases for the specified users.
	
	```txt
	REVOKE right[, right [, ... ]] ON DATABASE database [, database [, ...]] 
				FROM user [, user [, ...]]
	```


- Set the requested rights as inherited on the server.
	
	```txt
	REVOKE right[, right [, ... ]] FROM user [, user [, ...]]
	```





**Remark** 

- This type of query cannot be created with the wizard found in the query editor.

- These queries do not work with HFSQL Classic or Native Connectors. 




**Available rights**: The available rights are identical to the SQL GRANT command. The table of rights is available with the GRANT command.

## CREATE VIEW
<a name="create_view_ELTTEXTE001397"></a>
**CREATE VIEW** is used to create an SQL view. SQL views are equivalent to temporary files in memory. In most cases, an SQL view is extracted from a file or from several files. A view can be handled by a SELECT command.

For more details on SQL views, see [SQL view](../WDLang4/9000157.md). 

It uses the following format:


```txt
CREATE VIEW View [ ( Alias 1, Alias 2, ..., Alias N) ] AS SELECTQuery
```


In this syntax: 

- View is the name of the view. 

- Alias 1, Alias 2, Alias N represent the alias names of the items from the SELECT query.

- SELECTQuery is the SELECT query used to select the records found in the view. 




**SQL example**: Creating an SQL view containing the company, the name and the phone of customers: 


```sql
CREATE VIEW V_Customers
AS SELECT Company, Name, Phone FROM Customers
```


<a name="NOTE13"></a>
<a name="NOTE13_1"></a>


## DROP VIEW
<a name="drop_view_ELTTEXTE001421"></a>
**DROP VIEW** is used to delete a view.


```txt
DROP VIEW [IF EXISTS] View 1 [, View 2, ...View N] [RESTRICT | CASCADE]
```


- If the **IF EXISTS** keyword is specified and the views do not exist, an error message is generated.

- View 1, View 2, ... View N represent the list of views to delete.

- If the **RESTRICT** keyword is specified, the view is not deleted if it is in use.

- If the **CASCADE** keyword is specified, the view is deleted as well as the dependent views.

## CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW
<a name="create_materialized_view_ELTTEXTE001445"></a>
A materialized view is a persistent view: a file is created on disk from the content of the view. This view can be handled later by an application other than the one that created it.

**CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW** is used to create a materialized view.


```txt
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW View [ ( Alias 1, Alias 2, ...Alias N) ] 
	AS SELECT statement [WITH [ NO ] DATA]
```


- The **WITH DATA** keyword creates a view with data.

- The **WITH NO DATA** keyword creates an empty view without data.




**Remark** 

- This type of query cannot be created with the wizard found in the query editor.

- These queries cannot operate in HFSQL Classic or with Native Connectors.

<a name="NOTE15_1"></a>


## DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW
<a name="drop_materialized_view_ELTTEXTE001469"></a>
**DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW** is used to physically delete a materialized view from the disk.


```txt
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW [IF EXISTS] View 1 [, View 2, ...View N] [RESTRICT | CASCADE]
```


- If the **IF EXISTS** keyword is specified and the views do not exist, an error message is generated.

- View 1, View 2, ... View N represent the list of views to delete.

- If the **RESTRICT** keyword is specified, the view is not deleted if it is in use.

- If the **CASCADE** keyword is specified, the view is deleted as well as the dependent views.

<a name="NOTE16_1"></a>


## REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW
<a name="refresh_materialized_view_ELTTEXTE001493"></a>
**REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW** refreshes the content of a materialized view on the disk. The view is entirely recalculated.


```txt
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW View [WITH [ NO ] DATA]
```


- The **WITH DATA** keyword refreshes the view with the new data.

- The **WITH NO DATA** keyword refreshes the empty view without data.

<a name="NOTE18_1"></a>


## OPTIMIZE TABLE
<a name="optimize_table_ELTTEXTE001517"></a>
The **OPTIMIZE TABLE** command reorganizes and reindexes a data file, and rebuilds the indices of this file. This operation improves performance.

This function is equivalent to using the WLanguage [HIndex](../WDLang4/3044133.md) function to reorganize and reindex a data file.


```txt
OPTIMIZE TABLE FileName
```


FileName represents the name of the file to be reorganized.

Remark: 

- This function is locking: the data file cannot be accessed during the execution of the function. Make sure the file is not in use when the function is called.

- This function cannot be used with Native Connectors. 

- By default, the reindexing operation is performed according to one of the following parameters: standard reindexing, full-text reindexing, reindexing in the background, 80% density. To use other parameters, use [HIndex](../WDLang4/3044133.md).
