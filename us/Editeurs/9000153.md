## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000427"></a>
Layouts are used to define several views of a window in the same project without duplicating the window. 

Thus, **in a WINDEV or WINDEV Mobile application**, you can define, for example: 

- a specific view for portrait mode, 

- a specific view for landscape mode, 

- a phone-specific view, 

- a view specific to the tablet, 

- ...




At runtime, you can: 

- select the layout to display with [WinChangeLayout](../WDLang1/1000021056.md). 

- find out the current layout with [WinCurrentLayout](../WDLang1/1000021133.md).

### Creating a new layout for a WINDEV Mobile window
<a name="creating_new_layout_for_windev_mobile_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000070"></a>

To create a new layout for a window: 

1. Open the relevant window in the editor. 

2. On the "Window" tab, in the "Layouts" group, expand "Layouts" and select "Add layouts". <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_MP%20-%20Agencement%201%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.jpg)


3. The wizard for adding a layout starts. Pass the presentation step if necessary. 

4. The wizard prompts you to select an option to manage the differences between phones and tablets. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_MP%20-%20Agencement%201%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.jpg)
You can: 

	- Choose the current platform only (phone only or tablet only). 

	- Create layouts (because the controls are organized differently on the tablet and on the phone). 

	- Use the anchors only (because the anchors are sufficient to reposition the controls in the window according to its size). 




5. Go to the next step of the wizard. 

6. The wizard prompts you to select an option to manage the Portrait/Landscape orientation of the application. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_MP%20-%20Agencement%201%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.jpg)
You can: 

	- Create layouts (because the controls are organized differently on the tablet and on the phone). 

	- Use the anchors only (because the anchors are sufficient to reposition the controls in the window according to its orientation).




7. Go to the next step of the wizard. 

8. The wizard proposes to use a different presentation for each platform used (for example, a presentation for iOS and a presentation for Android). <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_MP%20-%20Agencement%201%20-%20HC%20N%B0004.jpg)


9. Select the desired option and go to the next step of the wizard. 

10. Validate the wizard. 

11. The different layouts are created if necessary. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_MP%20-%20Agencement%201%20-%20HC%20N%B0005.jpg&type=thumb)


12. The editor displays (on the right) the different layouts that can be used for the window. Double-clicking the badge of the desired layout allows you to open it in the editor and modify it. 




Tip: 

- The creation of a layout is based on the current edit platform. It is faster to position on the layout that is the closest one graphically in order to limit the modifications. 

- To customize the controls found in the different layouts, we advise you to start with the largest and most complete layout then create the other layouts by reducing or hiding elements.

### Creating a new layout for an internal window
<a name="creating_new_layout_for_internal_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000175"></a>

In mobile, the internal windows are used by several features: detailed window in a table, appointment in a Scheduler control, ...

Using layouts on the internal windows allows you to propose an interface for the portrait mode and for the landscape mode. 

To create a new layout for an internal window: 

1. Open the relevant internal window in the editor. 

2. On the "Window" tab, in the "Layouts" group, expand "Layouts" and select "Add layouts". <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_MP%20-%20Agencement%201%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.jpg)


3. The window for adding layouts is displayed. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Agencement_FI%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif&type=thumb)
Click "Create" to add a new layout. 

4. Validate the window. 

5. The editor displays (on the right) the different layouts that can be used for the internal window. 

	- Double-clicking the badge of the desired layout allows you to open it in the editor and modify it. 

	- The "Description" option in the context menu of the layout title bar allows you to define the layout parameters.

## Handling layouts
<a name="handling_layouts_ELTTEXTE000487"></a>


### Managing controls in the layouts
<a name="managing_controls_the_layouts_ELTPARAGRAPHE000213"></a>

Layouts are dissociated by default (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Agencement_Page_manip%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)): 

- A control created in one layout is created in all layouts, with the same characteristics (size, position, etc.). 

- A control moved or resized in a layout is moved or resized only in that layout. 

- The automatic dissociation is enabled by default for all the controls. With this mode, when a control is moved or resized in one of the windows in the layout, the changes will not be applied in the other windows. 




If you want size or position changes to be applied in all the other layouts, you can disable the automatic disassociation (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Agencement_Page_manip%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif)): the next size or position changes will be applied in all the layouts. A red triangle may appear when a control is selected. It indicates that the control has been dissociated, and that any changes made to it will be applied only in the current layout. 

**Tip**: Toast messages appear regularly to remind you if the changes made to a control are applied in other layouts, depending on the control disassociation options. 
<a name="NOTE3_2"></a>


### Context menu of controls specific to layouts
<a name="context_menu_controls_specific_layouts_ELTPARAGRAPHE000232"></a>

The "Layouts" context menu also allows you to dissociate specific characteristics of controls. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Agencement_Dissocier.gif)
These options are as follows:  

- **Dissociate position**: If this option is selected, the control will be moved only in the current layout. If this option is not selected, the control will be moved in all the layouts. 

- **Dissociate size**: If this option is selected, the control will be resized only in the current layout. If this option is not selected, the control will be resized in all the layouts.  

- **Dissociate anchors**: If this option is selected, the anchors of the control will be changed only in the current layout. If this option is not selected, the anchors of the control will be changed in all the layouts. 

- **Dissociate the font**: used to dissociate the font in one or more layouts. You can for example use a specific font for Android and another font for iOS. It is also possible to specify a font size for each layout.




Remark: When the automatic dissociation mode is disabled, and a specific dissociation is disabled via the context menu, the changes made in the current layout will be automatically applied in all the layouts.  

The "Layouts" context menu includes other options: 

- **Hide in this layout**: Hides the selected control in the current layout. 

- **Show in all layouts**: Shows the current control in all layouts. 




Remark: This context menu is available for a selection of controls. 

Limitation: For Chart controls, the properties of the title and legend cannot be dissociated between layouts.

### Context menu of layouts
<a name="context_menu_layouts_ELTPARAGRAPHE000270"></a>

You can manage layouts via the context menu of the thumbnails: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Agencement_MenuCtx.gif)


You can: 

- View the layout description and modify it. For more details, see [Layout settings](#NOTE4_1).

- Activate the layout, which means display it in order to modify it. 

- Activate the layout in double-view mode: the two layouts can be displayed and edited simultaneously. 

- Create a new layout from the current layout.

- Delete the selected layout. 

- Display proportional thumbnails.

- Refresh automatically: Used to refresh the layout as soon as a modification is performed in the window.  

- Refresh this layout: Used to immediately refresh the layout. 

- Refresh all: Used to immediately refresh all the layouts.

### Comparing windows with layouts
<a name="comparing_windows_with_layouts_ELTPARAGRAPHE000301"></a>

WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile allow you to compare two projects, two elements of a project, etc. For more details, see [Project comparator](../Editeurs/2030024.md). 

When comparing windows containing layouts, the differences found for each layout are listed. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Agencement_Diff.gif&type=thumb)






<a name="NOTE4"></a>
<a name="NOTE4_1"></a>


## Managing layouts at runtime
<a name="managing_layouts_runtime_ELTTEXTE000535"></a>


### Default operating mode
<a name="default_operating_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000317"></a>

The initial layout is automatically selected according to: 

- the system,

- the orientation, 

- the platform size,

- the size of the window or page (in the editor).






The layout settings can be defined for each platform ("Description" in the context menu of the layout title bar): <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Agencements_propri%E9t%E9s%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)





<a name="NOTE4_2"></a>


### Programming
<a name="programming_ELTPARAGRAPHE000366"></a>

You can: 

- force the layout to be used ([WinChangeLayout](../WDLang1/1000021056.md)). Simply indicate the number of the layout to use as parameter. This number is specified in the layout title bar. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Agencement_Numero.gif&type=thumb)


- get the current layout ([WinCurrentLayout](../WDLang1/1000021133.md)).
