## Overview

To create modern interfaces, you need to increase spacing between the controls in your windows. With WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile, simply indicate the desired spacing and the controls will move automatically.

To increase the space between controls: 

1. Select the desired controls. 

2. On the "Alignment" tab, in the "Other alignments" group, expand "Enlarge
Space out" and select "Space out selection". 

3. In the window that appears, adjust the settings to increase the space between the selected controls: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Aerer_la_selection%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.gif)
 You can: 

	- Specify the horizontal and/or vertical spacing value. Click <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Aerer_la_selection%20-%20HC%20N%B0003%201.gif)
 to change both values simultaneously.  

	- Specify the desired tolerance, if necessary. Tolerance allows you to accurately detect controls to be spaced out, even if they overlap or are not aligned properly.

 option allows you to see changes in real time in the window. 

4. Validate. The settings are applied to the selected controls. 




**Remarks**: 

- Spacing is added to the right and to the bottom. 

- Caution: The window is not resized.
