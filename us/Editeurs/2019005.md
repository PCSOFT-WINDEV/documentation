## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000289"></a>
During a project test in the editor, breakpoints are used to automatically start the debugger from a given line.

## How to?

### Inserting a breakpoint
<a name="inserting_breakpoint_ELTPARAGRAPHE000018"></a>

Several methods can be used to insert a breakpoint:

- Click on the left of the line where the breakpoint must be inserted. The mouse cursor turns into a hand and the ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_PointArret.gif)
 sign is displayed.

- On the "Code" tab, in the "Breakpoints" group, expand "Breakpoint" and select "Add a breakpoint".

- Press Ctrl + B.

- Open the context menu of bar for breakpoint management and select "Add a breakpoint".![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Ajout_pointarr%EAt%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)





**Remark**: The breakpoints are taken into account during the application tests in the editor of WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile. The breakpoints are ignored when using the executable.

### Disabling/Enabling a breakpoint
<a name="disablingenabling_breakpoint_ELTPARAGRAPHE000049"></a>A disabled breakpoint is still present in the code editor but it is ignored when debugging the application (it becomes grayed). 
Several methods can be used to disable the breakpoint for the current line:

- On the "Code" tab, in the "Breakpoints" group, expand "Breakpoint" and select "Disable breakpoint".

- Press Ctrl + Shift + B.

- Open the context menu of the breakpoint management bar and select "Disable breakpoint":

Remark: The breakpoint can be re-enabled at any time with "Enable breakpoint".

### Deleting one or more breakpoints
<a name="deleting_one_more_breakpoints_ELTPARAGRAPHE000076"></a>

Several methods can be used to delete a breakpoint:

- In the code editor, click the breakpoint. The mouse cursor turns into a hand and the ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_PointArret.gif)
 sign is displayed.

- On the "Code" tab, in the "Breakpoints" group, expand "Breakpoint" and select: 

	- "Delete breakpoint" to delete the breakpoint from the current line.

	- "Remove all breakpoints" to remove all breakpoints.




- In the debugger, click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_paspointarret.gif)
.

- Open the context menu of bar for breakpoint management: 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Code_Menu_PointArret.gif)


	- select "Delete breakpoint" to delete the breakpoint found on the current line.

- select "Remove all breakpoints" to delete all breakpoints.

### Listing the breakpoints
<a name="listing_the_breakpoints_ELTPARAGRAPHE000115"></a>

Several methods can be used to list the breakpoints found in the current project:

- From the code editor: on the "Code" tab, in the "Breakpoints" group, expand "Breakpoint" and select "List breakpoints".

- In the debugger, click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_Liste_pointarret.gif)
.

- Open the context menu of bar for breakpoint management and select "List the breakpoints".

### Conditional breakpoint
<a name="conditional_breakpoint_ELTPARAGRAPHE000145"></a>When debugging a loop, it may be useful to trigger the debugger after a number of passages (after the 35th iteration for example). 
To implement a conditional breakpoint: 

1. Create a breakpoint ([Inserting a breakpoint](#NOTE2_1) paragraph). 

2. Display the breakpoint properties: 

	- via the code editor: On the "Code" tab, in the "Breakpoints" group, expand "Breakpoint" and select "Breakpoint properties".

	- via the context menu of breakpoint: Open the context menu of bar for breakpoint management and select "Breakpoint properties".




3. In the window that is displayed, in the "Conditions" area, specify the conditions for taking the breakpoint into account: 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Gestion_des_points_d'arr%EAt_2%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif&type=thumb)


	- **Always** (default value): The breakpoint will not be conditional and it will always be taken into account. 

- **When the number of times a breakpoint has occurred is**: Used to make the breakpoint conditional. To do so, select a condition and the desired number of passages.

- **When the expression below is true**: Used to make the breakpoint conditional. Simply enter the condition directly in the "If" field. 

4. Validate. The conditional breakpoint is displayed in the editor (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Gestion_des_points_d'arr%EAt_2%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.gif)
).

### Breakpoint without stop but  saved in the debug trace
<a name="breakpoint_without_stop_but_saved_the_debug_trace_ELTPARAGRAPHE000197"></a>

In some cases, when debugging an application, it is useful to know the line of code on which the process passed but without stopping in the debugger. In this case, a single information must be displayed in the trace window. 

To implement this feature: 

1. Create a breakpoint ([Inserting a breakpoint](#NOTE2_1) paragraph). 

2. Display the breakpoint properties: 

	- via the code editor: On the "Code" tab, in the "Breakpoints" group, expand "Breakpoint" and select "Breakpoint properties".

	- via the context menu of breakpoint: Open the context menu of bar for breakpoint management and select "Breakpoint properties".




3. In the window that is displayed, in the "Actions" area, specify the action to perform during the passage by the breakpoint (these actions can be combined): 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Gestion_des_points_d'arr%EAt_2%20-%20HC%20N%B0004.gif&type=thumb)


	- Interrupt execution (default value): the breakpoint interrupts the execution ans starts the debugger on the current line of code. 

- Add a message to the debugger trace: the passage by the breakpoint adds the message specified in the "[Debugger trace](../Editeurs/2027028.md)" pane. 
			Remark: If no message is specified, the name of the current process is displayed in the "Debugger trace" pane. 

4. Validate. The ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Gestion_des_points_d'arr%EAt_2%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.gif)
 icon found before the breakpoint indicates that it includes specific properties.
