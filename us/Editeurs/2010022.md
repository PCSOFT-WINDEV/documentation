When creating a link, you can simply specify the destination. By default, the link opens the page specified in the current help page.

However, you can define the type of link and the destination in the link properties.

**To open the link properties**:

1. Position the mouse cursor on the desired link.

2. Select "Link properties" in the context menu.
