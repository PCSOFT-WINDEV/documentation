## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000169"></a>
To create a new flexible modeling, you can: 

- Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_nouveau.gif) in the quick access buttons. 

	- The creation window appears: click "Architecture" then "Flexible Modeling".

	- The wizard for creating a flexible modeling starts.




- Select "New flexible modeling" in the context menu of "Project explorer" pane. [The wizard for creating a new modeling](../Editeurs/2010101.md) starts.

## Flexible modeling creation wizard
<a name="flexible_modeling_creation_wizard_ELTTEXTE000193"></a>
The wizard for creating a flexible modeling allows you to:

- specify the title of the flexible modeling.

- choose the initial content of the modeling.

	- ***Empty***: Blank modeling

	- ***Simple***: Modeling that is using a database

	- ***With components***: Modeling that is using a database and components.


 This content can be customized thereafter.

- choose the advanced properties of the modeling. These properties affect:

	- the automatic insertion of title blocks: used to configure the automatic presence of a title block in the main modeling and in the submodels. This option can be modified at any time in the editor.

	- the automatic use of the contributors found in the Project Monitoring Center in the list of model actors. This option can be modified at any time in the editor.





The description of the model is completed. The model is displayed in the editor.

## The different elements that can be inserted into a model
<a name="the_different_elements_that_can_inserted_into_model_ELTTEXTE000217"></a>
The modeling editor allows you to insert several types of elements into your modeling. These elements are available in the "Creation" pane of modeling editor.

- Beginning (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Modelisation_Commencement_i.gif)): Used to view the beginning of the flexible modeling.

- Ending (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Modelisation_Termine_ico.gif)): Used to view the ending of the flexible modeling.

- Decision/Choice (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Modelisation_Choix_ico.gif)): Used to view a choice in the flexible modeling.

- Process (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Modelisation_Trait_Ico.gif)): Used to view a process.

- Application (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Modelisation_Appli_ico.gif)): Used to view an application.

- Data file (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Modelisation_HF_ico.gif)): Used to view a data file.

- Image (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Modelisation_Image_ico.gif)): Used to include an image (custom image or image found in the image catalog) in the flexible modeling. This image has the same characteristics as a process.

- Title block (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Modelisation_Cart_ico.gif)): Used to include a title block in the flexible modeling. Used to give a title to a flexible modeling or to a sub-model for example.


You also have the ability to insert simple shapes (circle, ellipse, rectangle, rounded rectangle) and to link all these elements.

### Describing the elements
<a name="describing_the_elements_ELTPARAGRAPHE000082"></a>

Each element of a flexible modeling can be configured via its description window ("Description" from the popup menu of the element).

For more details, see [Describing an element](../Editeurs/2010102.md).
<a name="NOTE3_3"></a>


### Adding a project element to a flexible modeling
<a name="adding_project_element_flexible_modeling_ELTPARAGRAPHE000094"></a>

If you perform a flexible modeling of a WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile project, the elements found in your project can be directly inserted into the modeling. To do so, Drag and Drop an element from the project (found in the "Project explorer" pane or in the "Analysis" pane for example) toward the model.

When the element is inserted into the flexible modeling, ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=modelisation_liaison.gif) indicates that the element is linked to an object of the project. To open this object directly, you can:

- double-click the arrow.

- select "Open the linked element" from the popup menu.

### Sub-modeling
<a name="submodeling_ELTPARAGRAPHE000108"></a>

The "Application", "Process" and "Choice" elements can be used to enter into a "sub-modeling". For example, the description of the ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) of a company may include the following sub-models: Management of customers, management of estimates, marketing, production, accounting, ...

For more details, see [Managing the sub-models](../Editeurs/2010104.md).

### Managing the altitude of objects
<a name="managing_the_altitude_objects_ELTPARAGRAPHE000120"></a>

All the elements found in the modeling editor can be stacked. An element can be found  in the foreground or in the background, an element can be moved one level up or down. This allows you to position an image in the background of the modeling for example.
