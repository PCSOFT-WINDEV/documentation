## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000215"></a>
A widespread need today is to transform Windows applications (or parts of applications) into dynamic websites.

As you already know, WEBDEV allows you to retrieve the code, the queries, the reports, the classes, the windows, ... of a WINDEV application. 

WEBDEV goes much further thanks to the webification wizard.

## How to webify a WINDEV project?
<a name="how_webify_windev_project_ELTTEXTE000239"></a>


### Tips and prerequisites
<a name="tips_and_prerequisites_ELTPARAGRAPHE000022"></a>

A WINDEV application can only be webified: 

- From version 24 onwards,

- using WINDEV 64 bits with WEBDEV 64 bits included. 
	Caution: You must have both WINDEV and WEBDEV licenses to perform this type of setup. To use the WINDEV-integrated version of WEBDEV, both WEBDEV and WINDEV dongles must be connected to the development computer.

- using WEBDEV 64 bits. 




Before webifying a WINDEV application, it is recommended to: 

- Know what the aim of the webified application is. Are all the features of the application necessary in the Web version? 
	For example: 

	- If the WINDEV application deals with system management, is it necessary to webify it?

	- If the WINDEV application uses functionalities that are not available on Web (scanner, Bluetooth communication, Word processing, etc.), these cannot be migrated and will require specific development if necessary. 




- Check the Business/GUI code splitting of the application. This can be verified using WINDEV. 
	The "Business logic / GUI code" splitting functionality simplifies migration and avoids doubling code in the windows and in the pages. 
	If this action is not performed before the webification, it is possible to do it afterwards. 

- Make sure the components used by the application are multi-product. 





### Start the webification wizard from WINDEV (with WEBDEV included)
<a name="start_the_webification_wizard_from_windev_with_webdev_included_ELTPARAGRAPHE000048"></a>

To start the WINDEV project webification: 

1. Open the project in WINDEV. 

2. On the "Project" tab, in the "Webification" group, expand "Webify" and select "Webify". The webification wizard starts. This wizard will create a specific project configuration for the elements of the site. 

3. Select the items to convert, especially the windows of your application. 
	Remarks: 

	- If some items have already been converted, the wizard lists the converted and non-converted items. 

	- Start by converting one or two windows of your application. You can convert the other windows as you go along. 




4. Go to the next step. 

5. Deselect, if necessary, the project elements that should not be included in the site's project configuration: reports, queries, classes, ... The checked elements are automatically integrated into the site. 

6. Go to the next step of the wizard: the Site configuration will be created and the selected windows will be "webified". 

7. Validate the wizard. 
	 Remark: This operation may take relatively long, depending on the number of elements selected (5 to 10 seconds per element). 

8. The project webification audit is automatically run. 




Remark: At any time: 

- The webification wizard can be run via the WINDEV menu: on the "Project" tab, in the "Webification" group, expand "Webify" and select "Webify".

- It is possible to webify a window via the "Webify" option of the window's context menu in the project explorer. 

- It is possible to copy/paste code or elements between a window and a page.

7. Validate the wizard. 
	 Remark: This operation may take relatively long, depending on the number of elements selected (5 to 10 seconds per element)

8. The project webification audit is automatically run. 




Remark: The webification wizard can be run at any time via the WEBDEV menu: on the "Project" tab, in the "Webification" group, expand "Webify" and select "Webify".


### Follow the tips of the webification audit
<a name="follow_the_tips_the_webification_audit_ELTPARAGRAPHE000134"></a>

The webification audit starts automatically after the webification wizard ends, and can be run at any time via the WINDEV menu: on the "Project" tab, in the "Webification" group, expand "Webify" and select "Webification audit".

This audit makes it possible to deal with certain compilation errors by suggesting solutions. 

All compilation errors encountered are also displayed in the error pane. 

It is necessary to correct all these errors for the application to be fully webified. Some errors may be related to processes or features that are not available on Web, unavailable WLanguage functions, etc.

Caution: In some cases, you may need to develop new features to adapt the application's behavior to websites. For example: 

- If the application used an Image Editor control, it may be necessary to use an Upload control, which will allow downloading the modified image. 

- If the application used a Word Processing control, it may be necessary to use an HTML control and adapt the analysis to manage HTML. 





### Finish the webification
<a name="finish_the_webification_ELTPARAGRAPHE000164"></a>

When all compilation and webification audit errors are corrected, and the management adaptations are made, the webification is completed. 

Other functionalities can be added later, such as Responsive Web Design. It may be a good idea to use Dynamic Serving temporarily to replace the different pages as you go along.
