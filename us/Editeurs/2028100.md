## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000174"></a>
The two-level setup (or multisite setup) combines:

- a reference [network setup](../Editeurs/2028085.md) deployed on a local network.

- an [HTTP setup](../Editeurs/9000026.md) used to update the reference setup on the local network.




The setup is performed in 3 steps:

- **Download (via an HTTP server) a reference setup on a local server**. During a first setup, the end user starts the setup by Internet, via a specific page.

- **Install this reference setup on a local server**. The reference application corresponds to the setup program of application on the user computers. 
	At the end of this setup, a scheduled task is created on the local server. This scheduled task is used to check and update (every 15 minutes) the version of the reference setup according to the version of the HTTP setup. 

- **The final application is installed on each user computer by running the setup program found on the server**. The updates will be automatically performed when the reference application changes on the server




When starting the application, an automatic update will be performed (according to the version of the application installed on the user computer)

### Creating a multisite setup
<a name="creating_multisite_setup_ELTPARAGRAPHE000039"></a>

To create a multisite setup: 

1. Create the application executable (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_Generation_Exe.gif) in the quick access icons). 

2. Start creating the setup procedure: 

	- ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_Generation_Exe.gif) among the quick access icons. 

	- Select "Create the setup procedure of the executable".




3. In the wizard, select "Setup".

4. Choose "Setup with automatic update (Live Update)". 

5. Choose "Multisite setup".

6. Choose whether to create a deployment package or deploy immediately to a PCS Cloud platform. 

7. Follow the different steps of the wizard.

### To install the reference version
<a name="install_the_reference_version_ELTPARAGRAPHE000060"></a>

Once the setup procedure is created, you have the ability to run the setup program. This program can also be run directly via the INSTALL.EXE file.

1. Start the setup program that was created beforehand. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Installation_a_2_niveaux%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif&type=thumb)


2. Choose the destination server on which the reference setup will be installed: 

	- Current computer ("Deploy the setup on this computer" option). This setup mode is not available during the setup on a Linux server.

		- If an HTTP server is installed on the current computer, this server is configured and the files of the reference application are copied into the specified directory. 

		- If no HTTP server is installed on the current computer, a default server is installed (WDADMINEXE) and automatically configured. The files of reference application are installed in the specified directory. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Installation_a_2_niveaux%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif&type=thumb)







Remarks: 

- In some cases, you may have to configure the HTTP server. You can for example create a virtual directory (alias) on the Web site that points to the directory where the FTP deployment was performed. 

- In any case, an HTML page allowing the end user to download the application setup is available. This page can be included in your site.




**3.** Validate the setup of the reference version.

At the end of this setup, a scheduled task is created on the computer. This scheduled task is used to check and update (every 15 minutes) the version of the reference setup according to the version of the HTTP setup. 

The name of the created scheduled task is specified on the last setup plane. This name has the following format: UPD_&lt;ApplicationName&gt;_&lt;identifier&gt;. Example: UPD_WDGoldLite_2169562193.

### Protocols used
<a name="protocols_used_ELTPARAGRAPHE000107"></a>

The setup and the updates of the reference application on the server are performed by the FTP protocol.

The setup and the updates of the application on the end-user computers from the reference application are performed by the HTTP protocol. 

The HTTP requests download the files (".tmp", ".net" and ".zip" extensions) from the server. Therefore, these extensions must be accepted by the Web server that is hosting the reference application. For more details, see [FAQ #3102](https://faq.pcsoft.fr/faqread.awp?idfaq=3102&lang=us).

### Download page
<a name="download_page_ELTPARAGRAPHE000121"></a>

When deploying the application, a htm page is automatically created with a link to the setup file of the client application (link to Install.exe).

This page can be modified and customized according to your own needs.

This page can be moved. To do so, update the download link of the page.
