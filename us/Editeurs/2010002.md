<a name="creating_the_help_system_application_website_ELTPARAGRAPHE000042"></a>

To create the help system of an application or website: 

1. Open your project in WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile.

2. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_nouveau.gif) in the quick access buttons. 

	- In the window that appears, click "Architecture", and then "Help".

	- The help system creation wizard starts automatically.




3. Go to the next step of the wizard and choose the type of help system you want to generate: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Cr%E9er_l_aide%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif&type=thumb)


	- HTML: the help system will be a static site with a summary and full-text search. 

- CHM: the help system will use the Microsoft HTML Help 1.3 format. 

- PDF: the help system will be a PDF document with a summary and bookmarks. 

4. Go to the next step. 

5. Specify the name of the help system. Go to the next step of the wizard. 

6. Select the application windows for which a help page must be generated.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Cr%E9er_l_aide%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif&type=thumb)

	If you choose to generate a CHM help file, you can select "Automatically generate the help button in each window" to automatically create a help button in each selected window. This button will automatically open the corresponding help page. 

7. Go to the next step. 

8. Select the application reports for which a help page must be generated. Go to the next step of the wizard. 

9. Validate. The wizard creates the set of help pages and prompts you to generate the help system in the desired format. 

10. Save the help: a WDH file is created in your project.




The help system is created and appears in the help editor. Each page can now be modified, deleted, ... in the help editor.
