## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000137"></a>
The project image gallery allows viewing all the images of a project in a single click. 

This gallery offers various features: 

- You are notified if an image in one of the project directories is not used. If necessary, it can be deleted.

- Duplicate images are marked: 

	- strictly identical images,

	- images that are binary identical but with a different name, or stored in different subdirectories. 


 Deleting images makes it possible to reduce the size of projects.

- Images that are not integrated into the SCM are also marked.
