## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000106"></a>
This deployment package is used to create a ZIP file containing the setup of the site. This file can then be given to the provider who will install the site with WDDeploy.

**Remark**: WDDeploy is a WEBDEV tool that allows:

- the hosting company to deploy a dynamic site from a package.

- to deploy static WEBDEV sites.

- to deploy PHP sites.

To create a deployment package: 

1. Start the wizard for creating the setup of a WEBDEV site: on the "Project" tab, in the "Generation" group, expand "Deploy site" and select "Generate and deploy site".

2. Generate the site library. 

3. Select "Create a remote deployment package". 

4. [Enter the information about the server](../Editeurs/2028046.md).

5. [Select the files to install](../Editeurs/2028058.md).

6. [Configure the automatic modification](../Editeurs/2028048.md)

7. [Configure the site](../Editeurs/2028051.md).

8. Specify the characteristics of the package:

	- The generation directory of the package. You can choose to clear (or not) the content of the directory during the generation.

	- The name of the deployment package.




9. Validate the package creation. Once the package creation is completed, WEBDEV proposes:

	- to start the deployment of the site (via WDDeploy).

	- to open the explorer.
