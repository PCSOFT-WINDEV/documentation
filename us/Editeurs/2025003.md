## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000258"></a>
Each WINDEV function is associated with a **WINDEV DLL**. In order for the executable to operate properly, all the necessary DLLs must be installed with the executable. All these DLLs correspond to the WINDEV Framework.

The wizard for [Creating an executable](../Editeurs/2025002.md) includes different modes to load the Framework.

## Framework
<a name="framework_ELTTEXTE000282"></a>
<a name="NOTE3_0"></a>


### The different options
<a name="the_different_options_ELTPARAGRAPHE000025"></a>

WINDEV proposes to:

- [Use the framework DLLs beside the executable](#NOTE3_1). 

- [Use the framework included in the executable](#NOTE3_2). 

- [Using the common framework](#NOTE3_3). 

- [Options kept for backward compatibility](#NOTE3_4).

### Use the framework DLLs beside the executable
<a name="use_the_framework_dlls_beside_the_executable_ELTPARAGRAPHE000049"></a>

The necessary WINDEV DLLs are automatically copied to the EXE subdirectory of the project when creating the executable. 

If you select this option: 

- The "Next" button lists the different framework DLLs required to run your application (see [Framework description](#NOTE3_5)). 

- If your executable uses specific external libraries, the list of libraries is also proposed with the list of framework DLLs.



<a name="NOTE3_2"></a>


### Use the framework included in the executable
<a name="use_the_framework_included_the_executable_ELTPARAGRAPHE000066"></a>

The executable is stand-alone. The DLLs will not be extracted during the start. 

If this option is selected, the project is recompiled to check the possible incompatibilities. 

**Caution**: All the framework DLLs are systematically included in the executable. The executable size can be quite important. 

**Remark**: The following features are not allowed: 

- Native Connectors

- .NET

- HTML control in the reports

- Burn functions (feature allowed from version 200051)

- Video Conference control

- CM15 (domotics via USB)

- Xaml control

- DirectX 3D charts

- Management of CAB archives



<a name="NOTE3_3"></a>


### Using the common framework
<a name="using_the_common_framework_ELTPARAGRAPHE000109"></a>

This option is used to:

- limit the size of program to install on the end-user computer. Indeed, the WINDEV framework is not copied into the EXE directory of project and it is not installed on the end-user computer.

- use the same WINDEV framework for all WINDEV applications used by the end user. The framework files are only found once on the computer (and not copied with each executable).




You can: 

- use the **common WINDEV Framework**: If this option is selected, you have the ability to configure the different messages displayed to the end user: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Exe_Framework_telech.gif)
**Notes**: 

	- In previous versions, the framework could only be downloaded by FTP. From version 26, this download primarily uses HTTPS (solves problems of ports to be opened in the firewalls). 

	- In the end user's computer, the PC SOFT Framework can be found in "Program Files\\Common files\\PC SOFT\\28.0\\Framework".




- use a **renamed framework**: This option is not available if you are using the XAML or .NET libraries in your application.
	If this option is selected, the "Next" button lists the different framework DLLs required to run your application. You can select the DLLs, their load mode and the prefix of the new name.
	**Remark**: When creating the setup (step "Setup files 3/3"), you can: 

	- choose to provide the framework or allow the end user to download it. 

	- define the framework setup path. On the end user's computer, the location of the framework will be stored in the registry key "\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\PC SOFT\\Framework\\28.0\\&lt;WD280WM.DLL&gt;" with a "PATH" (REG_SZ) value containing the full path of the **Common renamed framework**. For example "C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Framework\\".

### Options kept for backward compatibility
<a name="options_kept_for_backward_compatibility_ELTPARAGRAPHE000144"></a>

The following options are kept for backward compatibility: 

- **Include the necessary framework DLLs in the executable** (the DLLs are extracted during the start)
	The necessary DLLs will be included in the executable. In this case, the executable size will be increased. When the executable is run for the first time, the different framework DLLs will be extracted from the executable. 
	If you select this option, the "Next" button lists the different framework DLLs required to run your application (see [Framework description](#NOTE3_5)). If your executable uses specific external libraries, the list of libraries is also proposed with the list of framework DLLs.

- **Include part of the framework in the executable** (the DLLs are extracted at startup)
	This option is used to select the different DLLs that will be included in the executable. The other DLLs used by the application will be available beside the .EXE file of the application. When the executable is run for the first time, the different framework DLLs included in the executable will be extracted from the executable. 
	Click the ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Framework_select.gif) button and select the WINDEV DLLs to include.

### Framework description
<a name="framework_description_ELTPARAGRAPHE000167"></a>

For each WINDEV DLL or external library, you can:

- ***rename this file*** ("New name" column). If several WINDEV applications are installed on the same computer, each executable uses its own DLLs.
	The "Prefix" button allows you to replace "wd28 0" with the prefix of your choice. 
	Remark: Don't rename the WINDEV DLLs of programs created with an external language.

- ***specify the load mode of this file***:

	- *when starting the application*. In this case, the WINDEV DLL will be available as long as the application is used. However, the time required to start the application may increase according to the number and size of WINDEV DLLs to load. The amount of memory used may also increase.

	- *when it is first used* (recommended mode). The WINDEV DLL will be loaded in memory only during the first call to a function that uses this library. This load mode is recommended for the DLLs that are rarely used. This load mode optimizes the time required to start the application and the amount of memory used.

## External library

### External libraries (".WDL" files) used by the executable program
<a name="external_libraries_wdl_files_used_the_executable_program_ELTPARAGRAPHE000188"></a>

To share resources among several applications, WINDEV allows you to use libraries created by other WINDEV applications. These libraries are called "External libraries". To associate these libraries with the application:

- select "Workshop .. Library .. External libraries". By default, these libraries will be automatically proposed by the executable creation wizard.

- use [LoadWDL](../WDLang1/3013020.md) in your WLanguage code. The external libraries must be supplied along with your application.




**Remark**: For more details, see [Using several libraries in an application](../Editeurs/2030027.md).

For each available external library (".WDL" file), you can:

- ***rename this library*** ("New name"column).

- ***include this library in the executable***. If the WINDEV libraries required by the application and the external libraries are included in the executable, the executable will be stand alone. There is no need to install the libraries and the external libraries on the end-user computers. For more details, see [Self-contained executable](../Editeurs/2025009.md).
	**Remark**: If the libraries (".WDL" files) are not included in the executable, the libraries will be automatically copied to the "EXE" subdirectory of the project when creating the executable.
