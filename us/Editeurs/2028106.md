## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000255"></a>
The setup editor WDInst proposes a standard setup program.

This installer can be customized to propose a custom setup. 

This customization is available: 

- for the stand-alone setups: standard setup, compact setup or setup via MSI package. 

- for the setups with automatic update (Live Update). 




To customize the installer used in WDInst, select "Setup parameters .. Options of the installer".

### Standard installer
<a name="standard_installer_ELTPARAGRAPHE000044"></a>

The standard installer is the installer supplied with WINDEV in order to install the WINDEV applications. 

The **"WINDEV framework" tab** is used to specify the mode for managing the installer framework. You can: 

- copy the WINDEV framework with the setup. In this case, the size of the setup program can be quite important. You have the ability to customize the installer ("Customize the installer" tab). 

- download the WINDEV framework from an FTP server. In this case, the user must have an access to Internet. If this option is selected, the "FPT parameters" tab is used to configure the download of the framework. 

- use the WINDEV framework found on the user computer. In this case, the framework will be downloaded only if the WINDEV framework is not found on the setup computer. 




This tab can also be used to clean the former frameworks. The option "Delete the former frameworks found in the destination directory" is used to delete all the earlier versions of the WINDEV framework found in the setup directories.

The **"UAC" tab** is used to specify whether the installer requires the UAC or not. 

The **"Plug-in" tab** is used to specify the path of the plug-in that will be included in the standard setup program. For more details, see [Customizing the setup program (Plug-in)](../Editeurs/2028109.md). 

The **"Fonts" tab** is used to specify the character fonts that will be deployed and installed on the client computer. You have the ability to add the TTF or OTF files corresponding to the fonts to install.
Remark: Please check that you have the right to distribute these fonts.


### Custom installer: case of individual setup
<a name="custom_installer_case_individual_setup_ELTPARAGRAPHE000076"></a>

The standard setup program (called "WDSetup") is supplied with the WINDEV examples. To customize the setup program, all you have to do is modify the "WDSetup" project.

**Remark**: If you are using a custom setup program (custom "WDSetup" project), you must keep the ".WXF" file in order to run the test of this custom setup program. For more details, see [".WXF" file](../Editeurs/2028055.md).

To customize the setup program (in WINDEV): 

1. Open the "WDSetup" project. 
	By default, this project is located in the "Examples" subdirectory of the WINDEV setup directory.
	Remark: This example is also available in the "Full examples" displayed in the WINDEV home page (Ctrl + <).

2. Customize this project (modify the layout of windows, manage additional languages, ...).

3. Create a new executable: click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_generation_exe.gif) in the quick access buttons.


**Remark**: The name of this executable does not matter.

To use a custom setup program (in WDInst): 

1. Select "Setup parameters .. Options of the installer".

2. Select "Standard installer" (via the "Change" link if necessary).

3. In the "WINDEV framework" tab, select "Copy the WINDEV framework with the setup".

4. In the "Customizing the installer" tab, select "Use a custom installer" and select the executable of custom setup program.

5. In the "Installer DLL" tab, select the libraries (".DLL" files) associated with the custom setup program.




**Remark**: These libraries (".DLL" files) are located in the "EXE" subdirectory of the custom setup project.


### Custom setup: case of a setup with network update
<a name="custom_setup_case_setup_with_network_update_ELTPARAGRAPHE000112"></a>

The standard setup program is used to create the reference setup and the setup of client application. 

You now have the ability to use a different installer for the reference setup and for the setup of client application. 

Reminder: 

- The installer application (called "WDSetup") is supplied with the WINDEV examples. To customize the setup program, all you have to do is modify the "WDSetup" project.

- If you are using a custom setup program (custom "WDSetup" project), you must keep the ".WXF" file in order to run the test of this custom setup program. For more details, see [".WXF" file](../Editeurs/2028055.md).




To customize the setup program (in WINDEV): 

1. Open the "WDSetup" project. 
	By default, this project is located in the "Examples" subdirectory of the WINDEV setup directory.
	Remark: This example is also available in the "Full examples" displayed in the home page.

2. Customize this project (modify the layout of windows, manage additional languages, ...).

3. Create a new executable: click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_generation_exe.gif) in the quick access buttons.


**Remark**: The name of this executable does not matter.

To use a custom setup program for an application with network update (in WDInst): 

1. Select "Setup parameters .. Options of the installer".

2. Select "Standard installer" (via the "Change" link if necessary). 

3. in the "WINDEV framework" tab, select "Copy WINDEV framework with the setup".

4. In the "Customizing 
the installer" tab, you can: 

	- customize (or not) the installer of the client application. To customize the installer, select "Use a custom installer" and select the executable of the custom setup program.

	- customize (or not) the reference installer. To customize the installer, select "Use a custom installer" and select the executable of the custom setup program. 
			 Caution: a standard installer must be used to deploy a reference setup in the Cloud of PC SOFT applications. 




5. In the "Installer DLL" tab, select the libraries (".DLL" files) associated with the custom setup program.


**Remark**: These libraries (".DLL" files) are located in the "EXE" subdirectory of the custom setup project.


### Managing the UAC
<a name="managing_the_uac_ELTPARAGRAPHE000166"></a>

By default, installing a WINDEV application triggers the UAC. 

The " UAC" tab allows to modify this operating mode: 

- for the individual setups: the UAC is disabled for the setup on the end-user computer. 

- for the network setups with automatic update. In this case, the UAC can be disabled: 

	- for the installer of the end user, 

	- for the installer of the reference version, 

	- for both. 







Caution: The option "The installer DOES NOT require the administrator rights" has some restrictions: no files can be installed in the system directories (Program Files, Windows...), no system files and parameters can be modified (win.ini, path, etc.). 

The setup will fail if the rights are not sufficient. Whenever possible, the setup wizard will guide the user in his choices so that he can install the application.
