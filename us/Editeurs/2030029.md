## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000155"></a>
WEBDEV allows you "suck up" the existing HTML pages. The page is imported in the WEBDEV project and each element of the page is automatically converted into a WEBDEV element (Static control, HTML control, Link, etc.).

The principle of this feature is mainly based on retrieving the style of an HTML page.

For example: The following HTML page...
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ImportPageHTML.gif)
... becomes the following page in WEBDEV:
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ImportPageWW.gif)
Remark: To import a DremWeaver page or DremWeaver elements, see [Importing DreamWeaver elements into a WEBDEV site](../Editeurs/2030059.md).

### Importing an HTML page into a WEBDEV site
<a name="importing_html_page_into_webdev_site_ELTPARAGRAPHE000031"></a>

To import an HTML page into a WEBDEV site:

1. Open the WEBDEV project into which the page must be imported.

2. On the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, expand "Import" and select "An HTML page".

3. Specify the path or the URL of the HTML page to import. The preview of the HTML page to import is displayed.
	**Remark**: You also have the ability to start the page import via a Drag and Drop of the HTM file into the page editor of WEBDEV.

4. Select the import mode. The styles and the images associated with the imported page can be managed according to two methods:

	- If "I import an independent page into the project" is selected:

		- a WEBDEV style sheet (".WWS" file) is created and automatically associated with the imported page. This style sheet contains all the CSS styles of the initial page.

		- the different images associated with the imported page will be copied to a specific directory ("&lt;PageName&gt;" subdirectory of the default project directory).




- If "I import several pages of the same site into the project" is selected:

	- the styles of the imported page are automatically added to the style sheet associated with the project.

	- the different images associated with the imported page will be copied into the "&lt;ProjectName&gt;_WEB" directory of the project.

5. Validate. The HTML page is automatically included in the current WEBDEV project.

	- If identical styles are identified in the HTML page to import, only one type is created in the imported page. 

	- If a style used in an already imported HTML page is detected, this same style will be re-used. 





**Remark**: When importing an HTML page, we recommend that you do not perform any "copy-paste" operations.

The table below presents the main transformations performed between the initial HTML page and the created WEBDEV page:

| Source HTML page | Created WEBDEV page |
| --- | --- |
| Link | Link control associated with the action of the source link |
| Java applet | Java Applet control associated with the source Java Applet |
| &lt;OBJECT&gt; and &lt;BLINK&gt; tags | HTML control with the content of source tags |
| Image | Image control associated with the source image |
| Static | Static control or HTML Static control with the content of initial static. |


**Remark**: The map areas are not imported.
