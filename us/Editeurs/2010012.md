## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000175"></a>
There are multiple solutions to provide help to the users:

- [tooltips](#NOTE2_1),

- [information displayed in the status bar](#NOTE3_1),

- [standard help windows](#NOTE4_1),

- [HLP or CHM help file](#NOTE5_1).




The first three types of help systems are directly created in the window editor, in the description of each control ("Help" tab). These help systems have a simple presentation and cannot be linked together.

The fourth type of help system is created in the help editor. It is a more structured help system, allowing you to guide the users step by step.

## The tooltips
<a name="the_tooltips_ELTTEXTE000199"></a>
The tooltips are light yellow rectangles that are displayed when a control is hovered by the mouse cursor. A tooltip contains a help message about the hovered control. A tooltip can inform the user about the expected currency unit when typing a price, for example.

By default, the tooltips are automatically enabled in a WINDEV application. 

To type the message to be displayed in the tooltip of a control: 

1. Open the control description window (select "Description" in the context menu). 

2. In the "Help" tab, in the "Tooltip" area, type the text of the tooltip. 

3. Validate. 




**Remarks**: 

- In a multilingual application, you can enter the text of the tooltip in several languages, in the description window of the control. 

- If the "RTF" option is checked, the text can be formatted via the options of the RTF toolbar. The formatting will be maintained at runtime. 

- The text of the tooltip can be modified programmatically with the [ToolTip](../Proprietes/2510005.md) property. 

- The tooltip automatically applies a margin around the text: therefore, the text of the tooltip is more readable.

- End users can modify the tooltips in their applications. For more details, see [Control tooltips (AAF)](../Editeurs/1000021821.md). 




For more details on how to customize tooltips, see [Custom tooltips](../Editeurs/9500233.md).

## The status bar
<a name="the_status_bar_ELTTEXTE000223"></a>
You can display information in the status bar of a window. There are two cases:

- The message is linked to a control. The message can be entered in the "Help" tab of the description window of the controls. The message will be displayed when the control is selected by the user.

- The message is linked to a process defined programmatically. Simply use [Message](../WDLang1/3021006.md) to specify the message to display.

## The standard help windows
<a name="the_standard_help_windows_ELTTEXTE000247"></a>
The standard help windows are standard "Windows" windows used to display an explanatory text associated with a control.

The title and text of this type of window can be entered in the "Help" tab of the control description window. No image can be used in these windows.
<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Fenetre_Aide.gif)


If this window was defined for a control, the window will be automatically displayed when pressing the F1 key.

## CHM help file
<a name="chm_help_file_ELTTEXTE000271"></a>
A help system includes a summary, keywords (index) and pages. When users open the help, they are taken to a help page. Help pages can contain images, links to other pages, etc

In WINDEV, you can create CHM help files: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Aide_CHM.gif)


There are several ways to launch this help:

- full help: the help file is displayed directly.

- full context-sensitive help: the help file is opened on a specific page corresponding to the current window or control.




For more details on how to create a help file, see [Creating a help file](../Editeurs/2010004.md).

For more details on the different ways to open a CHM file, see [Starting the help](../Editeurs/2010017.md).

In most cases, this BalloonTip is displayed above an icon in the taskbar.<br>A BalloonTip is used to display an information to the user without interrupting his work (when the application is in background or when it is minimized in the Windows "Systray" for example).<br>Unlike the dialog boxes displayed by the WLanguage functions such as Info, Warning or Error, a BalloonTip is not locking. It is used to display messages whose importance and type can be configured.<br>A BalloonTip contains:<br>- an icon used to identify the type of message<br>- a title <br>- a "Close" button<br>- a specific message.
