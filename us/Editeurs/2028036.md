## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000118"></a>
If your applications must be installed in several countries, the setup wizard proposes to generate a multilingual setup.

## How to give the user the ability to start the setup in several languages?
<a name="how_give_the_user_the_ability_start_the_setup_several_languages_ELTTEXTE000142"></a>
All you have to do is select the different languages that will be proposed to the user when starting the setup program.

The setup program will be run in the language selected by the user.

Only French and English are automatically managed by WINDEV. In order for the setup program to support additional languages, you must customize the "WDSetup" project before creating the setup program. This project (supplied with the WINDEV examples) corresponds to the standard setup program of the WINDEV applications.

For more details, see [WDSetup: managing additional languages](../Editeurs/2028037.md).

**For all the selected languages, you will have the ability to specify**:

- a license, if a license is displayed at the beginning of the application setup.

- a "Readme" file, if a "Readme" file is displayed at the end of the application setup.

- an interface of the setup program specific to each language.




**Application installed on the network**
When updating an application installed on the network, a window is displayed when the application is started from an end-user computer. This window informs the user that an upgraded version of the application is available. This window allows the user to install (or not) the update. This window is also found in the WDSetup project.

## Starting the multilingual application
<a name="starting_the_multilingual_application_ELTTEXTE000190"></a>
By default, a multilingual application is run in the main language of the project ("Main language" in the "Languages" tab of the project description).

To start the application in the runtime language of the setup program:

1. Retrieve the runtime language of the setup program and save this language in a ".INI" file or in the registry of the setup computer. This operation can be automatically performed during the setup. For more details, see [Managing the registry and the ".INI" files during setup](../Editeurs/2028047.md).

2. Use [Nation](../WDLang1/3054014.md) to change the language the application uses at runtime.




For more details, see [Developing multilingual applications](../WDLang1/3054008.md).
