## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000079"></a>
WINDEV, WINDEV Mobile and WEBDEV allow you to create the class diagram of an application by reverse engineering the classes (".WDC" files) in the application. The classes of the project are analyzed and the class diagram is built based on the analysis information.

**Remark**: To create a class diagram using reverse engineering, the WINDEV application must contain WINDEV classes.
