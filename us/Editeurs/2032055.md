<a name="Sequence_sel_condition"></a>
When at least two selection conditions are found in a query, the sequence of selection conditions must be specified by the conditional operators AND and OR:

- ***Conditional AND operator***: the selected records will match both conditions. For example, select the customers whose name starts with the letter "A" AND who live in London.

- ***Conditional OR operator***: the selected records will match one of the two conditions or both conditions. For example, select the customers who live in London OR in New York.

The sequence of selection conditions is defined when creating the query. However, this sequence can be modified.
