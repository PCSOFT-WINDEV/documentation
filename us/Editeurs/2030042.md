## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000235"></a>
A project is a logical set of elements and processes whose purpose is to accomplish a given objective. The project manages:

- the relationships between elements (pages, reports, etc.)

- the relationships between elements and data files (described in the analysis linked to the project).




A project can be linked to a single analysis.

The same analysis can be associated with several projects.

### Creating a WEBDEV project
<a name="creating_webdev_project_ELTPARAGRAPHE000025"></a>

To create a WEBDEV project:

1. Start the project creation wizard via one of the following options: 

	- Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_nouveau.gif)
 in the quick access buttons. In the window that is displayed, click "Project". The project creation wizard starts.

	- In the WEBDEV home page, click "Create a project" and choose the type of project you want to create. 


 Remarks: 

- The steps needed to create the project may vary depending on the type of project chosen.

- The new project will contain a configuration specific to that type of project. The characteristics of your project configurations can be modified at any time. The same project can be associated with several project configurations. For more details, see [Project configuration](../Editeurs/9000030.md). 

2. Select "Site" and go to the next step. 

3. Specify the creation mode of the site:

	- [Blank project](#NOTE2_2). 

	- [Project based on an Application RAD. In this case, choose the desired template](#NOTE2_3).

### Internet site based on a blank project
<a name="internet_site_based_blank_project_ELTPARAGRAPHE000055"></a>

**If you have chosen to create a blank project**: 

1. Specify the type of site to create:

	- WEBDEV site. In this case, indicate if the site is: 

		- In Session mode (Classic): This type of site manages an automatic context. The pages are not referenced by search engines.
						This type of site is recommended for Intranet sites. 

		- In AWP mode: This type of site offers a context managed through programming. The pages are referenced by search engines. 
						This type of site is recommended for Internet sites. 




- PHP site (requires a PHP engine).

- Static site (limited features, no server code...).  

2. Go to the next step.

3. Specify the different options of the project:

	- ***The name and location***. These options cannot be modified. The project corresponds to a ".WWP" file for WEBDEV. This file can be opened by WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile. For more details, see [Common project](../Editeurs/2030049.md). All the objects associated with the project will be created in the specified directory ("C:\\My Projects\\&lt;Project name&gt;" by default).

	- ***The description*** that summarizes the purpose of the project. This description is used in the project documentation.




4. Go to the next step.

5. Specify the documents attached to the project. These documents can correspond to text files, images, scanned documents, ... For more details, see [Associating documents with the project](../Editeurs/9000092.md). 
	Go to the next step.

6. Specify whether this project must be included in the [Source Code Manager (SCM)](../Editeurs/2038001.md). The Source Code Manager simplifies teamwork and it can also be useful if you are working on your own. Go to the next step.

7. Indicate if you want to use the code style. The code style corresponds to a programming standard that can be applied to the entire application. This standard is used to prefix the different project elements, variables, etc, ... For more details, see [Code style](../Editeurs/9000074.md). Go to the next step.

8. Choose the skin and the color palette used to define the style book (you can try the different options in a preview). This style book will be proposed by default when creating a page or a report and it will be applied to all the new controls. This option can be modified in the project description window ("Style" tab). 
	Go to the next step. 
	

9. Select the ***supported languages***. These languages will be proposed by default as soon as an option in an element (control, page, report, etc.) can be translated. Select the **default language at runtime** ("Default language" in the context menu of the list of languages). This language will be used to view the project at runtime. 
	Go to the next step.

10. For WEBDEV or PHP sites, specify whether or not the project will use **a database**.
	If so, your project can use an existing or a new database. If you use a new database, a database creation wizard starts automatically once the project has been created.

11. Validate. The created project becomes the current project.




**Remark**: If you have requested:

- to use the SCM, [the wizard for adding projects into a repository](../Editeurs/2038002.md) is automatically started.

- to create a database, [the corresponding wizard](../Editeurs/2011011.md) is automatically started.

### Internet site based on an example (Application RAD)
<a name="internet_site_based_example_application_rad_ELTPARAGRAPHE000128"></a>

If you have chosen an Internet site based on an example: 

1. Select the example that will be used to create the project. 

2. Specify the different options of the project:

	- ***The name and location***. These options cannot be modified. The project corresponds to a ".WWP" file for WEBDEV. This file can be opened by WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile. For more details, see [Common project](../Editeurs/2030049.md). All the objects associated with the project will be created in the specified directory ("C:\\My Projects\\&lt;Project name&gt;" by default).

	- ***The description*** that summarizes the purpose of the project. This description is used in the project documentation.




3. Go to the next step.

4. Specify the documents attached to the project. These documents can correspond to text files, images, scanned documents, ... For more details, see [Associating documents with the project](../Editeurs/9000092.md). 
	Go to the next step.

5. Specify whether this project must be included in the [Source Code Manager (SCM)](../Editeurs/2038001.md). The Source Code Manager simplifies teamwork and it can also be useful if you are working on your own. Go to the next step.

6. Validate. The created project becomes the current project.




**Remarks**: 

- If you have requested to use the SCM, [the wizard for adding projects into a repository](../Editeurs/2038002.md) is automatically started.

- Creating a project from an example allows you to create a new project while keeping all the pages, reports and codes from the example. Just customize the example to your needs. 
	This creation method has several advantages: 

	- You choose the name of the project. 

	- You work separately from the example: no risk of overwriting your changes. If you want to follow the evolutions of the example, simply compare your project with the one in the example. For more details, see [Project comparator](../Editeurs/2030024.md). 

	- You can create or delete items without risk of changing the example.

## Notes
<a name="notes_ELTTEXTE000295"></a>


### The project file
<a name="the_project_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000175"></a>

The project corresponds to a ".WWP" file in WEBDEV. This file contains:

- The initialization code of the project, run when starting the project.

- The list of linked objects (pages, reports, etc.). The sequence between these objects is viewed in the project editor.

- The name of the home page and the name of the first dynamic page of the project. These pages are opened when running the project or when running a project test.

- The name of the analysis associated with the project (if if exists) and its password. The data files described in this analysis can be handled by the project elements (windows, pages, reports, etc.).

- The name of the UML model associated with the project (if it exists).

- The style sheet associated with the project (if it exists). This style sheet contains all the styles used by the project elements.

- The preset template associated with the project (if this template exists).

- The directory containing the list of tasks to perform on the current project.

- The directory of the data files (".FIC", ".MMO" and ".NDX" files) used during the project test. 

- The list of languages supported by the project and the main language of the project, used by default to view the project at runtime and in the editor.
