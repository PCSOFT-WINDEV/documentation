## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000151"></a>
The code editor proposes several tools used to correct the code:

- the automatic checker of the project elements, 

- the spelling checker for the comments and the character strings.

## Automatic checker
<a name="automatic_checker_ELTTEXTE000175"></a>
When the name of a variable or element is not recognized, the context menu of the code editor proposes a list of possible corrections. This list presents the name of the variables and/or project elements that may correspond.

For example: ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CorrecteurAuto.GIF)


No more typos, undeclared variable, etc.

Simply select the desired name.

## Spelling checker
<a name="spelling_checker_ELTTEXTE000199"></a>
The spelling checker of the code editor detects the typos in:

- the comments,

- the strings used in the code (simple strings, multilingual messages, dialogs and multilingual strings).




The WLanguage functions and commands are recognized as orthographically correct.

**Which spelling checker is used?**
The spelling checker used is the one provided with WINDEV/WEBDEV/WINDEV Mobile. This spelling checker can be used: 

- for comments (in French or English, depending on the language used for the code).

- for multilingual strings in French and English.


For more details, see [Check spelling based on Hunspell dictionaries](../WDChamp/1410087030.md).

The spelling checker is enabled by default. 

**Multilingual strings**
The dictionary used is the one of the displayed language. To change the language displayed, go to the "Display" tab, "Language displayed" group and expand "Language displayed". The spelling checker is an option global to the user.

**Remark**: By default, the spelling checker is only available English and French. To use the spelling checker for other languages in multilingual strings, simply add the files that correspond to the desired Hunspell dictionaries in: "\\Programs\\Data\\Dic". 
These dictionaries can be easily found on Internet. These dictionaries include a ".dic" file and a ".aff" file with the same name that must be found at the same location.

**Caution**: The spelling checker is disabled if the multilingual string uses a coloring that differs from the one of the strings.

**Words added to the dictionary**
The words that are added to the dictionary can be found in: "C:\\Users\\&lt;User&gt;\\AppData\\Roaming\\PC SOFT\\perso.dic".
