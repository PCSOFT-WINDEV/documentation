## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000200"></a>
It can be useful to use images or videos in help pages to explain the actions to be done, indicate which buttons must be used, etc.

In addition to "plain" images, you can insert clickable images into the help pages: when the user clicks the image (or a section of the image), a specific help page can be displayed (as a page or as a popup).
