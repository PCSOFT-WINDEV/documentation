The wizard for window creation proposes several types of windows associated with HyperFileSQL data files. 

To start this wizard: 

- Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_nouveau.gif)
 in the quick access buttons. 

- The creation window appears: click "Window" then "Window".

- In the wizard window, click the "RAD" tab to see the different types of windows.




The different types of windows depend on the selected RAD pattern. Indeed, each type of pattern proposes a selection of reusable types of windows.

The most common types of window are:

- Form window: simple, with browse, with linked table, with relation table, with linked form

- Table window: simple, with detailed form, with linked table, of relation

- Vision Plus window.




The following paragraphs present for each type of window:

- the operating mode of the window, 

- the different controls found in the window, 

- a preview of the window, 

- tips.




Remark: The characteristics of the windows may slightly differ according to the selected pattern.

## Form window
<a name="form_window_ELTTEXTE000381"></a>


### General case
<a name="general_case_ELTPARAGRAPHE000043"></a>

A **form** window displays the values of a record in a form, on the basis of one value per control. The records can be accessed one by one.

The form can:

- Allow (or not) the move to the previous and next records.

- Allow (or not) the creation, modification and deletion of records.



<a name="NOTE2_2"></a>


### Simple form
<a name="simple_form_ELTPARAGRAPHE000055"></a>

This type of window is used to view and modify a record.

This type of window does not allow you to:

- Browse the different records.

- Create or delete a record.




A "Simple form" window is made of:

- Buttons used to validate or cancel the input.

- Controls linked to the file items.




In most cases, the "Simple form" window is accessible from a "Simple table" window to view or modify the current record.
<a name="NOTE2_3"></a>


### Form with browse
<a name="form_with_browse_ELTPARAGRAPHE000074"></a>

This type of window is used to:

- Modify the record displayed.

- Create a record.

- Delete a record.

- Print the current record.

- Move to another record (next or previous one).




A "Form with browse" window is made of:

- Controls linked to the file items.

- Four navigation buttons.

- Buttons used to:

	- create a new record,

	- delete the current record, 

	- print the current record, 

	- close the window.







Compared to a "Simple form" window, a "Form with browse" window proposes:

- an easy way to move from a form to another one, 

- the ability to create several records in a row.




**Tip**: For the files that contain a lot of records, we advise you to select the records in a table and to modify or view the selected record in a "Simple form" window. Indeed, the selection is faster in a table.
<a name="NOTE2_4"></a>


### Form with linked table
<a name="form_with_linked_table_ELTPARAGRAPHE000105"></a>

This type of window is used to view in the same window the content of files linked by a simple link (1 - N).

The values of the record found in the main file are displayed in a form. The records linked to the current record (in the main file) are displayed in a table.

This type of window is made of:

- A form (in the top section) used to display the values of the current record found in the base file (main file).

- A table (in the bottom section) used to display the records linked to the current record in the main file.

- Buttons used to:

	- browse through the records displayed in the form and in the table, 

	- create a new record in the main file, 

	- delete the current record from the main file,

	- close the window, 

	- add a row into the table, 

	- modify a row in the table, 

	- delete a row from the table.







**Remarks**:

- If the file displayed in the table is a relation file, the window contains the buttons required to access the other relation file.

- If this type of window is selected for a file with no linked file (1-N link), WINDEV signals it.
