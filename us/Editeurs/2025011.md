## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000084"></a>
At the end of the executable creation wizard, WINDEV proposes to automatically make a backup of the sources of your project.

This option allows you to automatically save your project whenever a major version is deployed on the user computers.

When creating the executable, if you select "Yes: Start the project backup wizard", the wizard will be automatically started at the end of the executable creation.

This wizard allows you to:

1. Select the project directories that will be included in the backup (analysis, exe, ...)

2. Choose the type of backup to perform:

	- Compressed backup file (zip format). In this case, the name of the backup file must be specified.

	- Backup copy. In this case, the backup directory must be specified.

We advise you to perform a backup on a disk other than the work disk to avoid any physical problems.
