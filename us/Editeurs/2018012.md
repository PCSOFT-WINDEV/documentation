## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000087"></a>
An application that works with the user groupware can be used with a database handled by a Native Connector.

To integrate a Native Connector to an application that uses the User Groupware, the latter must be configured to use the data files on the server. These operations are presented in this help page.

## How to?
<a name="how_ELTTEXTE000111"></a>
To use the User Groupware files with a Native Connector: 

1. The User Groupware must not use the "Automatic start" mode in your application.
	Make sure that "Automatic run" is unchecked in the window for configuring the user groupware ("Workshop .. Configure the user groupware").

2. In the initialization code of the project, use [gpwOpenConnection](../WDLang6/3041007.md) to describe the connection to the database handled by a Native Connector.  
	**Caution**: the passwords defined for the files of user groupware are ignored.

3. Use [gpwOpen](../WDLang6/3041002.md) without specifying the paths of the data files. The concept of directory does not exist in this case.
