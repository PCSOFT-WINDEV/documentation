## Overview

WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile feature multiple methods to test applications:

- [Test of the entire project](../Editeurs/2019017.md)
	By testing the project you can simulate how the application will run when launched from an executable. This allows you to test the entire application, even if it is not complete. When a problem occurs during the execution of the project, you can start the debugger to identify and fix the problem.
	

- [Test of a single window](../Editeurs/2019014.md)
	Testing a single window allows you to run the current window in WINDEV or WINDEV Mobile. This allows you to test your project from a given window or to test a window once it has been finished. Like for the project test, the debugger can be started as soon as a problem occurs. 
	

- [Test of a single query](../Editeurs/2019011.md)
	Testing a single query allows you to run the current query in WINDEV or WINDEV Mobile. This allows you to check the operating mode of a query as soon as its development is complete.

- [Test of a single report](../Editeurs/2019015.md)
	Testing a single report allows you to run the current report in WINDEV. This allows you to check the implementation of a report as soon as it is developed. Like for the project test, the debugger can be started as soon as a problem occurs.

- [Running the project step by step](../Editeurs/2019001.md)
	Running the project step by step allows you to start the debugger when starting the application. This solution allows you to monitor the application progress.

- [Regression tests](../Editeurs/2019025.md)
	The regression tests on a project element or on the entire project enable you to check whether a modification (code, interface, and so on) does not affect the operating mode of the application. WINDEV proposes to save the tests in the project directly in order to run these tests for each new application version.




Remarks: 

- During a debug operation, all the elements on which you stop (via an breakpoint for example) are opened in the editor. The last test run (window, query, report, ...) can be re-run from any project element via "GO .. Re-run the last test" found in the quick access buttons. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=GO_Relancer_le_dernier_test%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)


- The lines of code run by the different types of test are automatically taken into account by the [Code coverage](../Editeurs/2019034.md).
