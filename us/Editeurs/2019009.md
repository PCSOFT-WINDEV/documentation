## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000303"></a>
The test of the entire project allows simulating the startup of the site. This makes it possible to test the entire site, even if its development is not complete yet. As soon as a problem occurs in the project execution (server code only), the debugger can be started to identify and fix the problem.

**Remark**: The test of a project can be run regardless of the current element in the editor.

This help page explains how test a project from the WEBDEV editor. It is also possible to test a project corresponding to a site in session mode from the WEBDEV administrator.

For more details, see: 

- [Testing a WEBDEV project (site in session or AWP mode) from the WEBDEV administrator (Development version)](../Editeurs/2019007.md).

- [Testing a WEBDEV project (site in session or AWP mode) from a test server](../Editeurs/2019012.md).

- [Differences between testing a project from the editor and from the administrator](../Editeurs/2019008.md).

## How to?

### Testing a site in session/AWP mode (or a part of a site in session/AWP mode)
<a name="testing_site_sessionawp_mode_part_site_sessionawp_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000037"></a>

To test a WEBDEV site (session/AWP mode) from the editor:

1. On the "Project" tab, in the "Test mode" group, expand "Test mode" and select "Debug project". 
	You can also click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_GO_Projet_WB_bl.gif) in the quick access buttons or press Ctrl + F9.

2. The editor is automatically minimized and the project is run in the default browser.

3. The first page of the site in session mode is displayed.




At the start of the project test, before opening the first page in session mode of the project, the following WLanguage events are run:

- declaring classes,

- initializing the project,

- declaring the global variables of the first page in session mode,

- initializing the first page,

- initializing the controls found in the first page,

- loading the first page,

- entering the first control of the first page (if this control has a WLanguage entry event).

### Running the test of site features
<a name="running_the_test_site_features_ELTPARAGRAPHE000074"></a>

It is recommended to test all the features of the site as well as the use of browser Back button. For more details on the browser's back button, see [Managing the Back button](../WDChamp/1012001.md). 
<a name="NOTE2_3"></a>


### Stopping the project test
<a name="stopping_the_project_test_ELTPARAGRAPHE000084"></a>

There are multiple methods to stop the test:

- 1st method: Close the browser in which the test is run. WEBDEV displays the editor open when the test was started.

- 2nd method: Go back to the editor with the taskbar (or press Alt + Tab) and confirm the end of the test. WEBDEV displays the editor open when the test was started.

## Notes

### Different modules started automatically when testing a WEBDEV site (session/AWP mode)
<a name="different_modules_started_automatically_when_testing_webdev_site_sessionawp_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000096"></a>

The following modules are automatically started during a test:

- The **Web server** installed on the computer and configured for WEBDEV when installing WEBDEV Development. 
	The test cannot be run if the Web server is not started.

- The **WEBDEV administrator** (WD280Admin.EXE).
	The administrator allows managing connections to the Web server and configure sites in WEBDEV session mode.

- The **WEBDEV engine** (WD280AWP.EXE).
	The WEBDEV engine is used to manage the requests made by the Web users from their browser and to return the corresponding dynamic HTML page.

- The **Internet browser**.
	The Internet browser displays the HTML pages of the WEBDEV site.

### Test browser
<a name="test_browser_ELTPARAGRAPHE000120"></a>

To select the test browser: 

1. On the "Project" tab, in the "Test mode" group, expand "Test mode".

2. Select "Test browser" and choose the desired browser.


**Remark**: The default browser is defined in the WEBDEV options: 

1. On the "Home" tab, in the "Environment" group, expand "Options" and select "General options of WEBDEV". 

2. In the window of WEBDEV options, click the "Web" tab. For more details, see [WEBDEV options](../Editeurs/2036001.md).




**Tip**: To select the browser used for testing the project, click the project test icon the quick access buttons. The arrow on the right expands a menu to choose the browser to be used for the test.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=GO_Projet_WB_deroule.gif)

### Testing a site from a phone
<a name="testing_site_from_phone_ELTPARAGRAPHE000167"></a>

You can test WEBDEV sites directly from a phone. This allows you to see how the site behaves on a given screen size. 

To test a project on a phone: 

1. Expand ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_GO_Projet_WB_bl.gif) in the quick access buttons.

2. In the list that appears, select "Test browser .. Phone (via a QR Code)". 

3. Run the test of the project by clicking the "GO" icon.

4. A window with a QR code is displayed.  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P8_Agencement_simple_1%20-%20HC%20N%B0016.jpg)


5. Scan the QR code with the device. 

6. The project appears on the phone. 




Remarks: 

- Simply make sure the mobile device is connected to the same network as the PC (generally, the Wi-Fi network of your organization).

- Breakpoints are enabled. The standard debug mode is still available: step-by-step execution, ability to view and modify the content of variables, etc.




For more details, see [Testing a WEBDEV site on a mobile device](../Editeurs/2019035.md).

### Vista and UAC: Running a test
<a name="vista_and_uac_running_test_ELTPARAGRAPHE000196"></a>

**Vista with UAC (user account control) enabled**: If WEBDEV is started as administrator (option in the context menu or "Run this program as administrator" in the properties of the executable), the guest account used by IIS7 must be part of the administrator group. Otherwise, an error is displayed in the browser.

**Vista without the UAC enabled**: If the Vista user is an administrator or a user from the administrator group, the guest account used by IIS 7 must be part of the administrator group. Otherwise, an error is displayed in the browser.

To get and change the guest account used, see [Identifying the account that runs the AWP protocol](../Editeurs/2037001.md).
<a name="NOTE3_4"></a>


### Directory of the data files used for testing
<a name="directory_the_data_files_used_for_testing_ELTPARAGRAPHE000210"></a>

To configure the data files used when running the site test in the editor:

1. Open the project description: on the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, click "Description".

2. In the "Files" tab, select the location of test data files:

	- Current directory: The data files will be located in the project EXE subdirectory.

	- Specific directory: The data files will be located in the specified directory. 








### Checking the runtime environment before the test
<a name="checking_the_runtime_environment_before_the_test_ELTPARAGRAPHE000237"></a>

Before running a project test, WEBDEV checks whether the test environment is properly configured.

If a problem is detected, WEBDEV displays a dialog box to open the diagnostic window: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=wb_verifconfig.gif)
The available options are as follows: 

- "Diagnose" opens the detailed diagnosis window.

- "Run test" ignores the diagnostic and runs the test. This option must be used if the diagnostic is incorrect.

- "Cancel" cancels the test.




The window for detailed diagnostic is as follows:  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=wb_verifconfig_detail.gif)


This window performs a set of tests to check whether the test environment is properly configured.

For each detected error, a "Fix" button allows you to automatically solve the issue.

The "Help" button will be enabled if an additional help is available.
