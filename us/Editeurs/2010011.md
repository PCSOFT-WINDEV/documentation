## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000092"></a>
The help editor allows you to define styles of paragraphs. These styles contain all the characteristics of a paragraph:

- characteristics of the font (name, size, weight, underlining, ...).

- characteristics of the paragraph (indents, bullet, alignment, spacing, ...).




Once defined, these styles can be used for all the pages of the help system.

<a name="how_manage_the_styles_ELTTEXTE000116"></a>
WINDEV gives you the ability to:

- create, modify or delete a style.

- apply a style to a paragraph.
	To apply a style to a paragraph, select the paragraph and select the corresponding style in the style combo box:

- dissociate a style: on the "Modification" tab, in the "Styles" group, click "Dissociate styles".
	This option allows you to cancel the association between a style and a paragraph. In this case, the style combo box is empty for this paragraph. Then, this paragraph can be associated with a style.
