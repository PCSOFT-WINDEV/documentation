## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000190"></a>
A project is a logical set of elements and processes whose purpose is to accomplish a given objective. The project manages:

- the relationships between elements (windows, reports, etc.).

- the relationships between elements and data files (described in the analysis linked to the project).




A project can be linked to a single analysis.

The same analysis can be associated with several projects.

### Creating a WINDEV Mobile project
<a name="creating_windev_mobile_project_ELTPARAGRAPHE000025"></a>

To create a WINDEV Mobile project:

1. Start the project creation wizard via one of the following options: 

	- Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_nouveau.gif)
 in the quick access buttons. In the window that is displayed, click "Project". The project creation wizard starts. Choose the type of project to create.

	- In the WINDEV Mobile home page, click "Create a project" and choose the type of project you want to create. 


 Remarks: 

- The steps needed to create the project may vary depending on the type of project chosen.

- The new project will contain a configuration specific to that type of project. The characteristics of your project configurations can be modified at any time. The same project can be associated with several project configurations. For more details, see [Project configuration](../Editeurs/9000030.md). 

2. For an "Android/iOS" project, indicate: 

	- If the application is intended to be cross-platform, Android only or iOS only. 

	- Specify if the project must be: 

		- a new project. 

		- a project based on an example. In this case, the next step is to select the example project used to create the new project. Only the step for SCM integration is kept. The project is then created. For more details, see [Create a project from an example](#NOTE3_2).




3. Indicate which type of devices the project is intended for. 

4. Specify the different options of the project:

	- ***The name and location***. These options cannot be modified. The project corresponds to a ".WPP" file for WINDEV Mobile. This file can be opened by WEBDEV and WINDEV. For more details, see [Common project](../Editeurs/2030049.md).
			All the objects associated with the project will be created in the specified directory.

	- ***The description of the project*** by summarizing the purpose of project. This description is used in the project documentation.




5. Go to the next step.

6. Specify the documents attached to the project. These documents can correspond to text files, images, scanned documents, ... For more details, see [Associating documents with the project](../Editeurs/9000092.md). Go to the next step.

7. Specify whether this project must be included in the [Source Code Manager (SCM)](../Editeurs/2038001.md). The Source Code Manager simplifies teamwork and it can also be useful if you are working on your own. 

8. Go to the next step.

9. Indicate if you want to use the code style. The code style corresponds to a programming standard that can be applied to the entire application. This standard is used to prefix the different project elements, variables, etc, ... For more details, see [Code style](../Editeurs/9000074.md). Go to the next step.

10. Select the **style book** used if necessary. This style book will be proposed by default when creating a window or report and it will be applied to all new controls. This option can be modified in the project description window ("Style" tab). Go to the next step.

11. Select the **project languages**. These languages will be proposed by default as soon as the option of an element (control, window , report, etc.) can be translated. Select the **default runtime language**. This language will be used to view the project at runtime. Go to the next step.

12. Specify whether the project must use **a database**.
	If so, your project can use an existing or a new database. If you use a new database, a database creation wizard starts automatically once the project has been created.

13. Validate. The created project becomes the current project.




**Remark**: If you have requested:

- to use the SCM, [the wizard for adding projects into a repository](../Editeurs/2038002.md) is automatically started.

- to create a database, [the corresponding wizard](../Editeurs/2011011.md) is automatically started.

### The project file
<a name="the_project_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000101"></a>

The project corresponds to a ".WPP" file in WINDEV Mobile. This file contains:

- The initialization code of the project, run when starting the project.

- The list of linked objects (windows, reports, etc.). The sequence between these objects is viewed in the project editor.

- The name of the first window opened (if it exists) when running the project or when running the project test.

- The name of the analysis associated with the project (if if exists) and its password. The data files described in this analysis can be handled by the project elements (windows, reports, etc.).

- The name of the UML model associated with the project (if it exists).

- The style sheet associated with the project (if it exists). This style sheet contains all the styles used by the project elements.

- The directory containing the list of tasks to perform on the current project.

- The directory containing the data files (".FIC", ".MMO" and ".NDX" files) used when testing a project (on the "Project" tab, in the "Test mode" group, expand "Test mode" and select "Debug on").

- The list of languages supported by the project and the main language of the project, used by default to view the project at runtime and in the editor.

### Create a project from an example
<a name="create_project_from_example_ELTPARAGRAPHE000132"></a>

Creating a project from an example allows you to create a new project while keeping all the windows, reports and codes from the example. Just customize the example to your needs. 

This creation method has several advantages: 

- You choose the name of the project. 

- You work separately from the example: no risk of overwriting your changes. If you want to follow the evolutions of the example, simply compare your project with the one in the example. For more details, see [Project comparator](../Editeurs/2030024.md). 

- You can create or delete items without risk of changing the example.
