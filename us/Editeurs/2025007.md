## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000201"></a>
Two types of directories can be configured when creating the executable:

- [the creation directory of data files managed by the User Groupware](#NOTE3_1).

- [the creation directory of HFSQL Classic data files created by the application](#NOTE4_1).

## Directory for creating the data files of the User Groupware
<a name="directory_for_creating_the_data_files_the_user_groupware_ELTTEXTE000225"></a>
Two categories of files are managed:

- **the data files used to identify the users**. These data files can be common to several applications.

- **the data files used to manage the rights granted to the users on the different application windows**. These files are specific to the application.




For more details, see [The files of the user groupware](../Editeurs/2018002.md).

By default, these data files are created in the "&lt;ApplicationName&gt;_GPW" subdirectory of the setup directory of the application. However, this directory can be modified. This directory can correspond to:

- a specific directory

- the directory of the application data. This choice is adapted to the UAC mechanism of Windows Vista. If the users work with Windows Vista (or later) and if the UAC mechanism is enabled, they will be able to use the application without any specific administrator rights.




The table below presents the different methods proposed by WINDEV to modify this directory.

|   | Data files of users<br>(can be common to several applications) | Data files of the rights granted to the users (specific to the application) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| How do I modify the creation directory of these data files? | <br><br>- through programming, with [gpwOpen](../WDLang6/3041002.md) (if the User Groupware has not been integrated with the "Automatic start" option).<br><br>- when configuring the User Groupware (caution: this directory is used for the tests of the application only).<br><br>- when creating the executable of the application.<br><br>- when installing the application. This directory is selected by the user.<br><br><br> | <br><br>- through programming, with [gpwOpen](../WDLang6/3041002.md) (if the User Groupware has not been integrated with the "Automatic start" option).<br><br>- when installing the application. This directory is selected by the user.<br><br><br> |
| What is the priority order when defining the creation directory of these files? | <br><br>1. The directory specified with [gpwOpen](../WDLang6/3041002.md) (if the User Groupware has not been integrated with the "Automatic start" option).<br><br>2. The directory selected by the user when installing the application (if the setup program allows the user to select this directory).<br><br>3. The directory selected when creating the application executable.<br><br>4. The default directory ("&lt;ApplicationName&gt;_GPW" sub-directory of the setup directory of the application).<br>	Therefore, the directory specified by [gpwOpen](../WDLang6/3041002.md) has priority over all the other directories.<br><br><br> | <br><br>1. The directory specified with [gpwOpen](../WDLang6/3041002.md) (if the User Groupware has not been integrated with the "Automatic start" option).<br><br>2. The directory selected by the user when installing the application (if the setup program allows the user to select this directory).<br><br>3. The default directory ("&lt;ApplicationName&gt;_GPW" sub-directory of the setup directory of the application).<br>	Therefore, the directory specified by [gpwOpen](../WDLang6/3041002.md) has priority over all the other directories.<br><br><br> |


**Special case: the data files of user groupware are installed with the application**
These data files are installed in the directory specified when creating the setup program (destination directory).

## Directory for creating the HFSQL Classic data files of the application
<a name="directory_for_creating_the_hfsql_classic_data_files_the_application_ELTTEXTE000249"></a>
By default, the HFSQL data files are created in the directories specified when describing files in the analysis. However, these directories can be modified:

- **when creating the executable of the application**.
	Several options are available: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=D%E9ployer%20l'application%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.gif)


	- **Automatic (recommended)**: This option is used to install the data files: 

	- in the application data directory (if the executable is installed in "Program files"). 

	- in the executable directory. 

- **through programming** with [HSubstDir](../WDLang4/3044028.md) or [HChangeDir](../WDLang4/3044168.md).

- **when installing the application**. The directory for creating the data files will be selected by the user.




In any case, the directory for creating the data files is defined according to the following priority order:

1. Directory specified by [HSubstDir](../WDLang4/3044028.md) or [HChangeDir](../WDLang4/3044168.md).

2. Directory selected when installing the application (if this option is proposed to the user).

3. Directory selected when creating the executable.

4. Directory specified when describing the files in the analysis.




Therefore, the directory defined by [HSubstDir](../WDLang4/3044028.md) or [HChangeDir](../WDLang4/3044168.md) has priority over all the other directories.

**Special case: data files installed with the application**
These data files are installed in the directory specified when creating the setup program (destination directory specified in the "Files installed" step).
The same directory should be used to install the data files supplied with the application and to create the new data files.
