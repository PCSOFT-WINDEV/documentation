The principle of windows with arrow is straightforward: when the user clicks a button, the window will be displayed against the calling button with a direction arrow between the button and the window.

**Remarks**: 

- This type of window is available for the iPad applications only. If "Window with arrow" is selected for an iPhone application, the window will not be maximized and will have no arrow.

- The window with arrow is using the system style: the border of the window and the drawing of the arrow are supplied by the iOS system.

	- In the wizard for window creation, select "Non-maximized blank with arrow" and validate.

### Title bar
<a name="title_bar_ELTPARAGRAPHE000049"></a>

By default, the created window with arrow contains no title bar. 

To display a title bar: 

1. Open the window description (select "Description" in the context menu). 

2. In the "Style" tab, check "With title bar". 

3. Validate. 




The content displayed in the title bar corresponds to the title of the window entered in the "General" tab of the description window of the window with arrow. 

**Remark**: Changing the title through programming ([Title](../Proprietes/2510090.md)) is only possible in the event "Global declarations" of the window.

<a name="opening_window_with_arrow_ELTPARAGRAPHE000104"></a>

To open a window with arrow from a button of the application:

	- Display the description window of Button control. 

	- On the "General" tab, in the "Action" area, select the window with arrow to open. ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=iPad_Fen_fleche_ouvrir.gif)





- Through programming, use [OpenChild](../WDLang1/3038021.md) in the click code of the button. 
	 Remark: You cannot call [OpenChild](../WDLang1/3038021.md) several times successively from the parent window. On the contrary, a parent window can open a child window that can open another child window.
