## Overview

### The CSS styles are the standard styles used on Internet.
<a name="the_css_styles_are_the_standard_styles_used_internet_ELTPARAGRAPHE000008"></a>

A CSS style is used to define some style characteristics of a control. The CSS styles are included and use by the WEBDEV styles. 

WEBDEV allows you to manage the CSS styles. You can: 

- Create a CSS style.

- Modify a CSS style.

- Associate a CSS style with a control.

- Overload the CSS style associated with a control.

## Managing the CSS styles

### Creating and modifying a CSS style
<a name="creating_and_modifying_css_style_ELTPARAGRAPHE000024"></a>

The creation and the modification of a CSS style can be performed: 

- from the description window of the control styles. 

- from the window for managing the CSS styles. For more details, see [Editing the CSS style sheets](../Editeurs/2016001.md). 





### Creation and modification from the description window of the control style
<a name="creation_and_modification_from_the_description_window_the_control_style_ELTPARAGRAPHE000035"></a>

The description window of controls is used to manage the style of this control ("Style" tab). Several elements are managed by the "Style" tab. The elements that can use a CSS style are identified by "(CSS)" at the end of their caption. Depending on the type of control, several CSS styles can be used for the different elements of the control. For example, for a List Box control: 

- a CSS style is used for the control caption 

- a CSS style is used for the elements found in the control.




The CSS style associated with a control element can be local or not.

**If the style is local**, it means that this style is associated with the current control (and that it does no longer depend on the modifications made to the project style sheet). This style will not be the one defined in the CSS style sheet: this style will be defined in the HTM file of the page.
You should avoid using styles that are "local to a control" because this option increases the size of the generated HTML pages (and therefore the time required to load the pages on the browser of the Web user).

**If the CSS style corresponds to the name of a CSS style**, it means that the control uses a CSS style defined in the CSS style sheet. If the CSS style is modified, all the controls that use this CSS style will be updated. 

To edit the characteristics of the CSS style, select the "Edit" option of the ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=VoletCatalogueimage%201.gif)
 button. You can: 

- edit the local style 

- edit the CSS style used. 

- create a new CSS style and associate it with the control. 




For more details, see [Description window of a CSS style](../Editeurs/2016007.md). 


### Associating a CSS style with a control
<a name="associating_css_style_with_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000064"></a>

To associate a CSS style with a control, all you have to do is specify, in the description window of the style, the CSS style that must be used for the requested element. 


### Overloading the CSS style associated with a control
<a name="overloading_the_css_style_associated_with_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000069"></a>

**Caution**: A modification performed in the bottom section of the style characteristics does not modify the CSS style associated with the control: this modification redefines the CSS style locally. Only the characteristics of the CSS style of the current element are overloaded. This modification is not applied to all the controls that use the CSS style.
