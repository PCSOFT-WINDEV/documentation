## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000181"></a>
You have developed an external component and you want to debug it? The user of an external component sends an executable indicating that your external component does not operate? You are using your external component in another project and you want to debug it?

Nothing's easier. WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile allow you to easily debug your external components.

### Debugging a component
<a name="debugging_component_ELTPARAGRAPHE000020"></a>

To debug a component:

1. Open the project corresponding to the external component.

2. In the "Project explorer" pane, select and enable the project configuration corresponding to the external component ("Enable this configuration" in the context menu).  

3. To configure the debug mode of the current component, go to the "Project" tab, "Test mode" group, expand "Test mode" and select "Configure test mode".<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Composant_debog.gif)


4. Select the desired option. You can:

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) **Run the test of the component from the project** (default):
			This option is used to run the test of the component from its own project. You have the ability to specify a command line.

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) **Run the test of the component by running another project**: 
			This option is used to run the test of the component by first running the project that calls the component. The component must have been included in the project. This option is useful if you have created a component and if you want to use it in another project.
			To use this option, you must specify the name and the full path of the project where the component was included. You also have the ability to specify a command line to start the project.
			Remark: the project that calls the component must have been opened at least once and recompiled from the current computer.

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) **Run the test of the component from an executable** (WINDEV only): 
			This option is used to run the test of the component by first running an executable. The component must have been included in this executable. This option is useful if one of your customers has a problem with a component and if he only sends you the executable for example.
			To use this option, you must specify the name and full path of executable in which the component was included. You can also specify a command line to start the executable.




5. In your project, include the breakpoints required to debug your component.

6. When the project test is started, the selected debug configuration will be used. When a breakpoint (or the [STOP](../Motscles/1511014.md) keyword) is encountered, the debugger will start automatically.

### Multi-product component for WEBDEV
<a name="multiproduct_component_for_webdev_ELTPARAGRAPHE000095"></a>

To debug the WEBDEV part of a cross-platform component (for example, a component for WINDEV and WEBDEV), you must generate the component that has the same name as the actual cross-platform component generated from WINDEV.

### Limitation
<a name="limitation_ELTPARAGRAPHE000102"></a>

You cannot debug components that use the runtime context of the "client" project (i.e. the project that uses the component).

**Reminder**: You can choose whether or not to use the runtime context of the "client" project in the component options: 

1. Open the description window of the "Component" configuration: 

	- If the component configuration is currently open: on the "Project" tab, in the "Project configuration" group, click "Current configuration".

	- In the "Project explorer" pane, open the context menu of the component configuration and select "Description". 




2. In the window that appears, in the "General" tab, click "Component options". 

3. In the "Access rights" tab, choose how the component accesses the data of the client project. To use the context of the client project, select "The component will access the data files, windows, pages and reports of the client project.".

4. Validate.
