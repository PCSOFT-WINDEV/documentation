## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000178"></a>
The development environment proposes several mechanisms for assisting the developers in their work.
Among these are:

- [The AAD (Assisted Application Development)](#AAD).

- [The display of features not supported by the platform](#FNSP).




<a name="AAD"></a>


## Assisted Application Development
<a name="assisted_application_development_ELTTEXTE000202"></a>
The Assisted Application Development (AAD) is a permanent help in the environment. This help suggests actions whenever it is appropriate.

To perform the suggested action, all you have to do is click the tooltip.

The AAD affects several areas (GUI, source code, ...), suggests the use of a component, proposes to improve an algorithm or give general advice.


### Managing and configuring the Assisted Application Development
<a name="managing_and_configuring_the_assisted_application_development_ELTPARAGRAPHE000033"></a>

To configure the Assisted Application Development: 

1. On the "Home" tab, in the "Environment" group, expand "Options" and select "General options of WINDEV/WEBDEV/WINDEV Mobile".

2. In the "AAD" tab, you can:

	- Specify the position of the AAD tooltip (at the top or at the bottom).

	- Ask to be notified about the new tips.

	- Ask for confirmation before running the selected AAD.

	- Re-enable an AAD.







To re-enable an AAD: 

1. On the "Home" tab, in the "Environment" group, expand "Options" and select "General options of WINDEV/WEBDEV/WINDEV Mobile".

2. Select the "AAD" tab. The list of disabled tips is displayed.

3. Check the line corresponding to the tip that must be re-enabled.

4. Validate.





### Don't display an AAD anymore
<a name="dont_display_aad_anymore_ELTPARAGRAPHE000077"></a>

An Assisted Application Development tip is displayed while you would rather not? You don't want to see this message anymore? All you have to do is disable the AAD.

To disable an AAD:

1. Open the context menu of the AAD (right-click the tooltip).

2. Select "Do not show this category again".




Remark: The popup menu of the AAD can also be used to configure the AAD ("Configure the AAD).


### Some examples of AAD

### Anchoring error in a Table control
<a name="anchoring_error_table_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000093"></a>

In the following window, no column of the Table control is anchored. When enlarging the window, the Table control will not be enlarged properly.

The AAD proposes to select the column to anchor.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=AAD_TABLE.gif)

### Anchoring conflict
<a name="anchoring_conflict_ELTPARAGRAPHE000105"></a>

In the following window, several anchor conflicts have been detected.

The AAD explains the problem and applies the best possible anchors whenever possible. If the AAD cannot define the best anchoring, different solutions are proposed.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=AAD_Ancrage.gif)


<a name="FNSP"></a>


## Unsupported features per platform
<a name="unsupported_features_per_platform_ELTTEXTE000250"></a>


### Display of unsupported features per platform
<a name="display_unsupported_features_per_platform_ELTPARAGRAPHE000118"></a>

The editors (windows, pages ...) propose an automatic help allowing you to see the unsupported features for each platform of the current configuration in the 7-tab window.

The unsupported features are covered by a blue shade.

For example, in the description window of a Combo Box control in a Java configuration, the following elements are not supported and therefore not accessible:

- eYe Magnet.

- Left indent.

- Vertical alignment.

- Opacity.
