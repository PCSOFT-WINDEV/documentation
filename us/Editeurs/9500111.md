## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000147"></a>
Our surveys show that end users love AAFs (Automatic Application Features) and that these AAFs increase their satisfaction and efficiency when using the applications.

To allow end users to discover AAFs, WINDEV proposes the following mechanisms:

- Displaying a "Did you know" window about AAFs when the application starts. The user can disable this feature.

- Presence of a menu option for displaying today's tips ("Did you know") in the "?" menu.

### Displaying a "Did you know" window when the application starts
<a name="displaying_did_you_know_window_when_the_application_starts_ELTPARAGRAPHE000024"></a>

To display the "Did you know" window at the startup of your WINDEV application:

1. Open the project description: on the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, click "Description".

2. In the "Advanced" tab, check "".
	**Remark**: "Show available AAFs" opens the PDF file with the presentation of the different AAFs available in a WINDEV application.

3. Validate the project description window. The "TipOfTheDay" component is automatically included in your project.




**Remarks**:

- To avoid displaying the "Did you know" window, simply uncheck "" ("Advanced" tab in the project description window).

- The user can choose not to show the "Did you know" window again: to do so, check "Don't display the tips at startup". To show the window again, it is possible to use the Shift key when launching the executable.

2. Select "Wizard for editing the '?' menu" in the context menu.

3. In the wizard, when choosing the menu options, select "Did you know".

4. Validate the wizard. The automatic help menu is modified. The "TipOfTheDay" component is automatically included in your project.




**If your application contains no automatic help menu**: 

1. Adding an automatic menu into your main window: on the "Window" tab, in the "Bars and menus" group, expand "Main menu" and select "Add the '?' menu". For more details, see ['?' menu](../Editeurs/9000070.md).

2. In the wizard, the "Did you know" option must be checked in order to create the corresponding menu option.

3. Validate the wizard. The automatic help menu is created. The "TipOfTheDay" component is automatically included in your project.


**Remark**: If the automatic menu proposes the "Did you know" option, the tips will also be automatically proposed when the application is started: "" is automatically checked in the "Advanced" tab of the project description.
