## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000165"></a>
When creating the setup program of a WINDEV application that uses HFSQL Client/Server data files, WDInst allows you to:

- install an HFSQL Client/Server server if necessary.

- configure the connections used. You can:

	- use the connection parameters defined in the analysis or by programming.

	- define the connection parameters when installing the application.




- copy the HFSQL data files onto the server during the setup

### Overview
<a name="overview_ELTPARAGRAPHE000026"></a>

During its setup, a WINDEV application (single-user or multi-user application) can allow the end user to install an HFSQL Client/Server server. To do so, the WINDEV application must use HFSQL Client/Server data files in the description of its analysis.

WDInst allows the end user to install:

- a Windows HFSQL Client/Server server.

- a Linux HFSQL Client/Server server.




You can propose to install one of these servers (or none of them).

To configure this option from WDInst, select "Parameters of setup ..  HFSQL files" and select the "HFSQL C/S" tab.

### Advanced parameters
<a name="advanced_parameters_ELTPARAGRAPHE000042"></a>

**Caution**: To perform these setups, the setup program must be supplied with the setup packages of the different servers. The "Advanced" button is used to select the necessary package. The latest available setup package can also be downloaded from the PC SOFT website.

## Configuring the connection

### Overview
<a name="overview_ELTPARAGRAPHE000051"></a>

If your application uses connection to an HFSQL Client/Server server defined in your analysis, this connection can be automatically configured when installing the final application.

To configure this option from WDInst, select "Parameters of setup .. HFSQL files" and select the "Connections" tab.

**To configure these connections**: 

1. Select "Edit location of data files".

2. Select the desired connection.

3. Click the "Edit" button.

The main options to configure are as follows:

- Whether the user is allowed (or not) to enter the parameters of the connection during the setup.

- Whether the connection must use the options of the analysis or the values specified in the wizard. In this case, you must specify the values of the connection to use.

- Whether the parameters of the server that was previously installed must be used.




**Remarks**:

- If the setup must create a new database, the user specified in the setup parameters must be a "superuser". Indeed, even if the user has the rights to create the database, he will not be allowed to create the data files for this database.

- If a connection is configured by the user during the setup, this connection will be stored in the "&lt;Executable Name&gt;".WX" file. This file corresponds to a hidden file in text format. The access to its content is performed by [INIRead](../WDLang1/3013043.md).

## Installing the data files

### Overview
<a name="overview_ELTPARAGRAPHE000088"></a>

When creating the application setup program, you can also deploy the HFSQL Client/Server data files on the desired server.

To configure this option from WDInst, select "Parameters of setup ..  HFSQL files" and select the "HFSQL C/S" tab.

### Settings
<a name="settings_ELTPARAGRAPHE000097"></a>

For each data file of the application, the "Properties" button allows you to specify:

- the current location of the data file to install.

- the connection that must be associated with this data file. 

- whether the index must be copied or not. If the index is not copied, it will be automatically rebuilt during the setup. This option is used to limit the size of the setup program when the index file is quite large.

## Installing the application
<a name="installing_the_application_ELTTEXTE000279"></a>
When the application is installed on the end-user computer, depending on the selected options, the wizard allows the user to install an HFSQL Client/Server server on a Windows or Linux computer and to configure the connection used.  

At the end of setup, a ".wx" file is created beside the executable.

The structure of this file is given for information. This structure can be modified in a forthcoming version. This file should not be modified manually.

This file contains the following information:


```txt
[CONNECT]
NBCX = Number of defined connections
NOM_x = Name of the connection number x
BASE_x = Type of database used (always corresponds to hAccessHFClientServer)
ADRESSE_x = Address of server used (name or IP address of the server)
PORT_x = Connection port
DATABASE_x = Name of the database used
LOGIN_x = Connection login
PWD_x = Encrypted password
ACCESS_x = Type of access (hOReadWrite or hORead)
EXTINFO_x = Extended information
```
