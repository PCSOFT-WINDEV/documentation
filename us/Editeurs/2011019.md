## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000100"></a>
In the MERISE methodology, the conceptual data model defines the objects and the actions that must be taken into account in the database. This model only represents the structures of information and the exchanges of information for the system used, independently of the physical constraints linked to the nature of the database used.

**For example**, a simplified invoicing system can be described as follows:

- A customer corresponds to a customer name, to a customer company and to a customer address.

- An order corresponds to an order number, to an order date, to an order amount and to a list of products ordered.

- A customer can "place" an order at a given date.

## Creating a CDM
<a name="creating_cdm_ELTTEXTE000124"></a>
To create a CDM:

1. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_nouveau.gif) in the quick access buttons: 

	- The new element window appears: click "Data" then "Analysis (CDM)".

	- The wizard for creating a CDM starts.




2. Specify:

	- the ***name and directory of CDM***. The CDM corresponds to a ".MCD" file. By default, this file will be created in the directory of the project analysis (&lt;Project name&gt;.ANA directory). This directory must be accessible in read/write mode.

	- the ***CDM caption*** that briefly describes the subject of CDM.

	- whether the CDM must be directly ***associated with an analysis***. This analysis can be an existing analysis or a new analysis that will be created.




3. The created CDM becomes the current CDM. You can now create the first [entity](../Editeurs/2011005.md).

4. Create all the elements ([entities](../Editeurs/2011005.md), [associations](../Editeurs/2011004.md), [properties](../Editeurs/2011018.md) and [relationships](../Editeurs/2011013.md)) of your CDM.
