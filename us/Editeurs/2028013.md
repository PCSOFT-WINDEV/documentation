## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000353"></a>
When creating the setup program, WDInst allows you to configure the computer where the program will be installed. You can:

- Propose to run a program at the end of the setup (with or without command line).

- Modify the registry:

	- modify the application identifier,

	- modify or create entries.




- Modify or create the "AutoExec.BAT" file.

- Modify or create the ".INI" files.




By default, the setup program proposes to start the program at the end of the setup and no modification will be performed on the user computers.

The setup computer is configured in the setup editor WDInst. To start WDInst, go to the "Tools" tab, "Utilities" group and click "WDInst".

The wizard for creating the setup program can also be used to configure the setup computer.

**Remark**: To ask the user to confirm the modifications performed on the system when installing the application:

1. Start WDInst: on the "Tools" tab, in the "Utilities" group, click "WDInst".

2. Select "Setup parameters.. System configuration".

3. Check "Ask for confirmation before modifying".

## Proposing to run a program
<a name="proposing_run_program_ELTTEXTE000377"></a>
By default, the setup program proposes to run the executable of the application at the end of the setup. The option "Start the program" is checked. The executable is automatically run when clicking the "Done" button.

The setup editor WDInst is used to:

- Specify the executable to run and associate parameters with this executable. A single executable (".EXE" file) found in the list of files to install can be run.

- Not propose to run the executable of the application at the end of the setup.




**Remark**: If modifications are performed in the "AutoExec.Bat" file, no program should be run at the end of the setup. Indeed, the modifications performed in this file will be taken into account when the computer is restarted.

2. Enter the executable that must be run at the end of the application setup ("Command line" option).
	The executable to run corresponds to:

	- The name and full path of the executable file. The following keywords can be used:

		- **- &lt;SetupDir&gt;**: installation directory chosen by the user.

		- **- &lt;SetupDrive&gt;**: drive of the installation directory chosen by the user.

		- **- &lt;SetupFile&gt;**: data file installation directory. WDInst is used to configure this directory. 
						For more details, see [Configuring the data file directory](../Editeurs/2028017.md).

		- **- &lt;WinDir&gt;**: Windows directory on user computers.




- The runtime parameters of the program installed (if necessary).
			For example: "&lt;SetupDir&gt;\\MyApp.EXE /Param".

## Modifying the application identifier
<a name="modifying_the_application_identifier_ELTTEXTE000437"></a>
When installing the application, a specific identifier is automatically created in the registry. This identifier can be modified with WDInst.

By default, this identifier is "&lt;ApplicationName&gt;". For example, "WD Customer" for the "WD Customer" application. This identifier may contain spaces.
<a name="NOTE3_2"></a>


### Modifying the application identifier in the registry
<a name="modifying_the_application_identifier_the_registry_ELTPARAGRAPHE000133"></a>

To modify the identifier used to uninstall the application: 

1. Select "Setup settings .. End of setup".

2. Select the new identifier of the application.

## Modifying or creating the "AutoExec.BAT" file
<a name="modifying_creating_the_autoexecbat_file_ELTTEXTE000467"></a>
You can modify or create the "AutoExec.BAT" file on user computers. This file will be modified or created (if necessary) when the computer is restarted. In this case, a reboot is automatically proposed at the end of the application setup.

The "AutoExec.BAT" file is used to:

- add the application executable directory to PATH,

- start the application when the setup computer is started, 

- etc.




**Reminders**:

- The "AutoExec.BAT" file is automatically run when the computer is started.

- PATH lists the directories in which executables (".EXE" files) and libraries (".DLL" files) are searched for first.

### Modifying or creating the "AutoExec.BAT" file
<a name="modifying_creating_the_autoexecbat_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000164"></a>

To modify or create the "AutoExec.BAT" file: 

1. Select "Setup parameters.. System configuration".
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Options%20install_WDINST%20-%20HC%20N%B0006%201.gif&type=thumb)


2. Enter the command line to add to or to modify in the "AutoExec.BAT" file.

3. Specify the location of the corresponding "command line" in the "AutoExec.BAT" file ("Location" combo box):

	- ***At the beginning***. Corresponds to the first "command line" of the "AutoExec.BAT" file.

	- ***At the end***. Corresponds to the last "command line" of the "AutoExec.BAT" file.

	- ***After PATH***. By positioning a "command line" after PATH, the executable and/or libraries used in this command line will be searched for in the directories of PATH.




4. If the same command line already exists in the "AutoExec.BAT" file, you can:

	- Replace the existing command line. Select the "Replace" parameter ("Type" combo box).

	- Add the command line. Select the "Add" parameter ("Type" combo box).







**Remark**: To directly add the installation directory of the application to PATH, use the buttons:

- "At the beginning". The installation directory will be the **first** directory in PATH.

- "At the end". The installation directory will be the **last** directory in PATH.

## Modifying or creating the ".INI" files
<a name="modifying_creating_the_ini_files_ELTTEXTE000497"></a>
When installing a WINDEV application, you have the ability to modify or create the ".INI" files on the setup computers. These files will be associated with the application installed.

The ".INI" files are used to:

- Customize the application according to the connected user

- Define the default parameters of the application




Then, the ".INI" files can be read and modify from the application directly ([INIRead](../WDLang1/3013043.md) and [INIWrite](../WDLang1/3013039.md)).
<a name="NOTE5_2"></a>
For example, to save the setup program runtime language to the "MyAppli.INI" file (in the application installation directory):

- ".INI" file: &lt;SetupDir&gt;\\MyApp.INI

- Section: LANGUAGE

- Parameter: LANGUAGE_INSTALL

- Value: &lt;Language&gt;




The **&lt;Language&gt;** keyword will be automatically replaced during the setup by the number of the runtime language of the setup program (this number can be used by [Nation](../WDLang1/3054014.md)).

In this example, if the number of the runtime language is 3, the following parameter will be added into the "MyApp.INI" file:


```txt
[LANGUAGE]
LANGUAGE_INSTALL=3
```

<a name="NOTE5_3"></a>


### Modifying or creating ".INI" files during the setup
<a name="modifying_creating_ini_files_during_the_setup_ELTPARAGRAPHE000228"></a>

To modify or create ".INI" files during the setup: 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Options%20install_WDINST%20-%20HC%20N%B0006%202.gif&type=thumb)


1. Select "Setup parameters.. System configuration".

2. Specify the relevant ".INI" file. This file will be created if necessary. You can specify:

	- The name and full path of the file.
			The following keywords can be used:

		- **&lt;SetupDir&gt;**: installation directory chosen by the user.

		- **&lt;SetupDrive&gt;**: drive of the installation directory chosen by the user.

		- **&lt;SetupFile&gt;**: data file installation directory. WDInst is used to configure this directory. For more details, see [Configuring the data file directory](../Editeurs/2028017.md).

		- **&lt;WinDir&gt;**: Windows directory on user computers.
						For example: "&lt;SetupDir&gt;\\MyDirectory\\MyFile.INI".




- The name of the file. The file will be searched for or created in the Windows directory. For example: "MyFile.INI".

- No file. The "WIN.INI" file will be modified.

3. Specify the section to modify or to create.

4. Specify the parameter to modify or to create.

5. Specify the value of the parameter.
	To retrieve the number of the runtime language for the setup program, use the **&lt;Language&gt;** keyword.

## Modifying or creating entries in the registry
<a name="modifying_creating_entries_the_registry_ELTTEXTE000533"></a>


### Overview
<a name="overview_ELTPARAGRAPHE000262"></a>

When installing a WINDEV application, you have the ability to modify or create entries in the registry.

The registry allows you to:

- Customize the application according to the connected user

- Define the default parameters of the application




Then the registry can be read and modified from the application directly ([RegistrySetValue](../WDLang1/3065006.md), [RegistryQueryValue](../WDLang1/3065012.md) , ...).
<a name="NOTE6_2"></a>
For example, to save the runtime language of the setup program in the registry, type:

- Key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\MyCompany\\MyApp\\1.0\\

- Name: Language

- Value: &lt;Language&gt;




The **&lt;Language&gt;** keyword will be automatically replaced during the setup by the number of the runtime language of the setup program (this number can be used by [Nation](../WDLang1/3054014.md)).
<a name="NOTE6_3"></a>


### Modifying or creating entries in the registry during the setup
<a name="modifying_creating_entries_the_registry_during_the_setup_ELTPARAGRAPHE000296"></a>

To modify or create entries in the registry during the setup: 

1. Select "Setup parameters.. System configuration".
