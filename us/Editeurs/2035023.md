## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000094"></a>
A state-transition diagram presents a sequence of states that an object goes through during its lifecycle. It describes how the states of an object or component change.

A state is defined by its duration and stability.

A transition represents the change from one state to another.

A transition is triggered:

- by an event.

- automatically when no triggering event is specified.

## Elements of a state-transition diagram
<a name="elements_statetransition_diagram_ELTTEXTE000118"></a>
A state-transition diagram includes the following elements:

- **state**: represents the value of the object attributes at a given time.

- **initial state**: represents the state when the system is started.

- **final state**: represents the state of the system at the end of the operation.

- **superstate**: used to structure the diagram by specifying several distinction levels between the states.

- **history**: represents the last active state of a superstate (or composite state).

- **entry/exit points**: represent the states in a superstate. This allows you to link these states to other states that do not belong to the superstate.

- **transition**: represents the change from one state to another.

- **package**: divides and organizes the diagram representation (in the same way that directories organize files).
