A WEBDEV cluster is a set of servers (or server farm). Each server contains all your sites and webservices. 
This makes it possible to support an unlimited number of connections to these sites and webservices.

This page presents the different steps to install a WEBDEV cluster and its nodes.

### Overview
<a name="overview_ELTPARAGRAPHE000024"></a>

Installing a WEBDEV cluster implies the following: 

1. Installing the WEBDEV Application Server in "Cluster" mode on a first computer (Computer 1). 

2. Installing the WEBDEV Application Server in "Cluster node" mode on a second computer (Computer 2). 

3. Linking the cluster to the cluster node. 





### 1. Installing the WEBDEV Application Server in Cluster mode (Computer 1)
<a name="1_installing_the_webdev_application_server_cluster_mode_computer_1_ELTPARAGRAPHE000033"></a>

The installation steps are as follows:

1. Select the installation language of WEBDEV Application Server and confirm. 

2. Select "Install a full version" and enter the activation key. Go to the next step of the wizard. 

3. Accept the license agreement. Go to the next step of the wizard. 

4. Select the installation path of the Application Server ("C:\\WEBDEV 28" by default). Go to the next step of the wizard. 

5. Select the WEBDEV Application Server mode: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Install%20Serveur%20WB%20Cluster%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)


	- To install a standard WEBDEV Application Server, select "Stand-alone server". 

- To install a WEBDEV server cluster, select "Cluster". Select the last option and go to the next step of the wizard. 

6. Select the cluster node setup mode. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Install%20Serveur%20WB%20Cluster%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif)
You can: 

	- Install a new cluster. 

	- Join a cluster. 


 Select "New cluster" and go to the next step of the wizard. 

7. In the next step, you can describe the first cluster node to be created. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Install%20Serveur%20WB%20Cluster%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.gif)
Indicate the DNS name of the node. This name will be used by the other cluster nodes to contact this node. Go to the next step of the wizard. 

8. The next step allows you to specify the root directory for deploying sites and web services. Go to the next step. 

9. In the next step, you can define the advanced settings of WEBDEV Application Server. you can: 

	- Use default parameters: The values of the advanced parameters are defined by default. You can also change these options after the installation. 

	- Define values of the parameters manually. In this case, the wizard allows you to define the advanced settings of the WEBDEV Application Server. 




10. Go to the next step of the wizard. 

11. Specify a Windows account to be used as WEBDEV administrator. This account will also be called "Hosting account". <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Install%20Serveur%20WB%20Cluster%20-%20HC%20N%B0004.gif)

	For a cluster, you will need to create a new Windows account. The WEBDEV Application Server must know the user's password to connect to the various cluster nodes. Go to the next step.  

12. Select the remote administration sites to be installed with the WEBDEV Application Server. You can install: 

	- The WEBDEV Application Server remote administration site. This site allows you to easily manage all the sites and webservices deployed, configure the Application Server, etc.

	- HFSQL administration site: This site allows you to remotely manage HFSQL databases. 


 Select the desired options and go to the next step. 

13. The next step allows you to manage the hosting of SaaS sites. The SaaS activation automatically installs a site and a web service to manage your SaaS sites. For more details, see [SaaS](../WDLang3/9500213.md). Validate this step.

14. The next step allows defining the need for a secure connection to access all administration sites. If you select a secure connection, specify the domain name used to access the administration sites. 

15. In the next step, you can install the ODBC driver for HFSQL. This driver allows direct access to HFSQL Classic and Client/Server files from an external application.  

16. Validate the different setup steps.

17. The web server is checked. If the computer contains several virtual servers, select the web servers on which the WEBDEV Application Server must be installed. You can keep the default website. Validate.

18. The WEBDEV Application Server in Cluster mode is installed. 

19. At the end of the installation, the wizard prompts you to register the WEBDEV Application Server. 

20. The wizard shows different options in the next step: select the desired options and keep "Start the WEBDEV administrator". Validate.

21. The "WEBDEV Application Server" is automatically configured. WEBDEV sites can be deployed immediately. 

22. The WEBDEV administrator and the Hosting Control Center are automatically started.





### 2. Installing a Cluster node (Computer 2)

To install a Cluster node:

1. Select the installation language of WEBDEV Application Server and confirm. 

2. Select "Install a full version" and enter the activation key. Go to the next step of the wizard. 

3. Accept the license agreement. Go to the next step of the wizard. 

4. Select the installation path of the Application Server ("C:\\WEBDEV 28" by default). Go to the next step of the wizard. 

5. Select the WEBDEV Application Server mode: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Install%20Serveur%20WB%20Noeud%20Cluster%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)


	- To install a standard WEBDEV Application Server, select "Stand-alone server". 

- To install a WEBDEV server cluster, select "Cluster". Select the last option and go to the next step of the wizard.

You can: 

	- Install a new cluster. 

	- Join a cluster. 


 Select "Join an existing cluster" and go to the next step of the wizard. 

7. The next step allows you to specify the root directory for deploying sites and web services. Go to the next step. 

8. In the next step, you can install the ODBC driver for HFSQL. This driver allows direct access to HFSQL Classic and Client/Server files from an external application.  

9. Validate the different setup steps.

10. The web server is checked. If the computer contains several virtual servers, select the web servers on which the WEBDEV Application Server must be installed. You can keep the default website. Validate.

11. The WEBDEV Application Server in Cluster node mode is installed. 

12. At the end of the installation, the wizard prompts you to register the WEBDEV Application Server. 

13. The wizard shows different options in the next step: select the desired options and keep "Start the WEBDEV administrator". Validate.

14. The "WEBDEV Application Server" is automatically configured. A window is displayed to add the server to a cluster (see below). 





### Linking the cluster to a cluster node
<a name="linking_the_cluster_cluster_node_ELTPARAGRAPHE000120"></a>

After installing a cluster node, the WEBDEV Application Server displays the following window: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Install%20Serveur%20WB%20Noeud%20Cluster%20-%20HC%20N%B0004.gif)
If the node is not linked with the cluster, this window will appear each time the WEBDEV administrator is started. 

To link the cluster (Computer 1) and the cluster node (Computer 2):

1. Copy the security token displayed in the window at the end of the cluster node installation (Computer 2). 

2. Open the WEBDEV administrator on Computer 1 using one of the following methods: 

	- Remote administrator started via an address such as "http://cluster_server_address/WDWebAdmin". In the "Cluster" tab, select "Add a node". In the popup that opens, enter the DNS name of the node, the security token and the description of the node. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Cluster_Admin_wb_jeton.GIF&type=thumb)


	- Local administrator of Computer 1 (or one of the computers in the cluster). In the "Cluster" tab: 

	- click "Add a node to this cluster". <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Cluster_Admin.GIF&type=thumb)




Once the node is linked to the cluster, the WEBDEV administrator window that shows the token disappears automatically (on the computer corresponding to the node). 

Remark: In a WEBDEV cluster, nodes automatically synchronize with each other. The nodes periodically synchronize the configuration of the WEBDEV Application Server, as well as the configuration and content of the sites and webservices deployed.
