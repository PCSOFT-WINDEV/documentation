### Principle for generating a PHP site with WEBDEV
<a name="principle_for_generating_php_site_with_webdev_ELTPARAGRAPHE000011"></a>

WEBDEV allows you to generate a PHP site without even knowing the PHP language. The site is developed in WLanguage like any other WEBDEV site.

You also have the ability to directly enter your PHP code.

A syntactic and lexical analysis is now available for the PHP code (and for the Javascript code).

When generating the pages, the WEBDEV pages and the WLanguage functions are automatically converted into PHP pages.



The following databases can be used

- HFSQL, 

- MySQL,

- PostgreSQL,

- Oracle,

- MariaDB.
