<a name="including_javascript_files_ELTPARAGRAPHE000022"></a>

You have the ability to include one or more JavaScript files in a site or in a page (\*.js). These files will be used by the generated HTML pages. These files must be in the "&lt;ProjectName&gt;_WEB" directory of the site.

To include a JavaScript file in a page: 

1. Open the page description: on the "Page" tab, in the "Description" group, click "Description".

2. Select the "Details" tab.

3. In "External resources", you can add JavaScript resources:

4. Select (if necessary) the desired encoding. If the encoding corresponds to "&lt;Not defined&gt;", the encoding is automatically detected. 

5. Validate.




To include a JavaScript file in the project:

Including external resources in the site is used to include the interface files (programming interface) proposed by the external services (Web API) on the WEB. This gives you the ability to interface with these external services in browser code.

To include an external resource in a page:

1. Open the page description: on the "Page" tab, in the "Description" group, click "Description".

2. Select the "Advanced" tab.

3. Select the "Javascript" tab.

4. Click "Add a Web resource" and specify the address of the desired web resource.

5. Select (if necessary) the desired encoding. If the encoding corresponds to "&lt;Not defined&gt;", the encoding is automatically detected. 

6. Validate.

### Automatic detection of encoding
<a name="automatic_detection_encoding_ELTPARAGRAPHE000137"></a>

If the encoding corresponds to "&lt;Not defined&gt;", the encoding is automatically detected:

- case of a Web reference: the server is interrogated. The encoding is supplied by the server.

- case of a file reference: if the file is in UTF8, the encoding is automatically switched to UTF8.
