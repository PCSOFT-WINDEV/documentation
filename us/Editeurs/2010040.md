## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000220"></a>
WINDEV includes several Automatic Application Features (AAFs). These AAFs allow end users to print and export the content of a Table control to Excel, show a calendar when entering a date, etc. 

In most cases, specific context menus are linked to AAFs. These context menus are displayed on windows, Edit controls, Image controls, etc.

You can easily define the different options of the context menu in the editor.

A custom context menu can also be added to the AAF context menu. This context menu can be placed **before** or **after** the AAF context menu.

**Remark**: An AAF menu is displayed for the following controls: 

- In WINDEV: Organizer, Button, Edit control, Combo box, Gantt chart, Window, Chart, Image, Check box, List box, Organization chart, Scheduler, Radio button, Table, Pivot table, TimeLine and Looper.

- In WINDEV Mobile: Combo box, Check box, List box, Radio button, Table and Looper.

### Configuration at project level
<a name="configuration_project_level_ELTPARAGRAPHE000029"></a>

By default, all the options in the AAF context menus are available for all the types of controls in a project.

To hide some AAF context menu options for some types of controls:

1. Open the project description: on the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, click "Description".

2. Display:

	- the "Advanced" tab in WINDEV.

	- the "Style" tab in WINDEV Mobile.




3. Click "AAF menu". The window that appears allows you to configure the options that will be proposed by default in the AAF context menu for each type of control.

4. For each type of control, select the options to display.

5. Validate the settings window and the project description.




**Remark**: The AAF menu can be configured for the following controls: 

- In WINDEV: Organizer, Button, Edit control, Combo box, Window, Image, Check box, List box, Scheduler, Radio button, Table, Pivot table, TimeLine and Looper.

- In WINDEV Mobile: Combo box, Check box, List box, Radio button, Table and Looper.

### Configuration at control level
<a name="configuration_control_level_ELTPARAGRAPHE000068"></a>

A context menu can be chosen for each type of control. The "System" context menu is proposed by default. This "System" context menu contains the different AAF options.

To configure the context menu of the controls: 

1. Open the control description window.

2. Open the "UI" tab.

3. The "Context menu" combo box allows you to configure the context menu:

	- the ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_Fleche.gif) button is used to create a new context menu.

	- the combo box is used to:

		- display the AAF context menu and set the options that will be displayed for the current control.

		- display a specific context menu. This context menu can be displayed before or after, or even replace the AAF context menu




4. Validate.




**Remark**: The AAF menu can be configured for the following controls: Button, Edit control, Combo box, Window, Image, Check box, List box, Organization chart, Radio button, Table, Pivot table, TimeLine, Looper and Chart. For the Chart control, the context menu can be shown or hidden and a custom menu can be displayed before or after. To configure the options that will appear in the context menu of a chart, use [grMenuOption](../WDLang3/3042042.md).

## How to translate AAF context menus?
<a name="how_translate_aaf_context_menus_ELTTEXTE000280"></a>
In a multilingual application, AAF context menus must be translated as well as all application captions and messages. WDINT is required to translate this type of menu.

**Reminder**: WDINT is an additional tool. This tool creates a specific file (.WDM extension) containing all the translations of the resources found in WINDEV/WEBDEV/WINDEV Mobile. This tool is supplied with WDMSG to extract the captions to translate and reintegrate the translated captions into your application. Contact PC SOFT Sales Department for more details about the conditions for using this product. By default, all English and French resources are distributed with WDINT.

### Translating default context menus
<a name="translating_default_context_menus_ELTPARAGRAPHE000135"></a>

To translate the default context menus: 

1. Install WDINT if not already done.

2. Start WINDEV. On the "Project" tab, in the "Translate" group, expand "Translate" and select "WDINT - WINDEV framework translation". 

3. In the WDINT wizard, specify the language of the files to extract as well as their name, and the path of the file to be generated. This file will contain the messages to translate in the selected extraction language. 

4. Translate resources with WDTRAD (included with WDINT).

5. Reintegrate the translation file. 

6. Generate the WDM file that corresponds to the desired language. 

7. Copy the WDM file to your application directory.

8. In WINDEV, open the project description window: on the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, click "Description". 

9. In the "Languages" tab, specify the WDM file containing the desired translations ("Miscellaneous" tab).

10. Validate the project description window. 

11. When the application is run in the target language, the context menus will appear in that language.
