<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000119"></a>
The [editor of select queries](../Editeurs/2032049.md) is used to limit the number of records that will be displayed in the result of the query. It allows you to: 

- select the first n records found in the query result.

- select the last n records found in the query result.

- select the n records from a given record found in the query result.




The number of records to select can be defined: 

- by value. 

- in percentage.

- by a parameter.

- the ten best customers: the customers with the greatest turnover.

- the 15 worst selling products.

- the 20 products found after the record XXX.

- ...
