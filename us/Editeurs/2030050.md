To reload a document, go to the "Home" tab, "General" group, expand "Open" and select "Reload document".

This feature performs the following operations:

- Close the current document in the editor (without saving the modifications).

- Open the same document.




This option allows, for example, to re-open the current window based on the last save (last Ctrl + S). All the changes made after the last save are ignored.
