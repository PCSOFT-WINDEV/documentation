## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000203"></a>
When creating or modifying a window in the window editor, you have the ability to display the alignment rulers. 
These alignment rulers can also be displayed in the page editor and in the report editor.

These rulers have snap-on guides: any control that comes close to a guide is automatically "snapped" by it. This feature allows you to easily position, align or resize the controls found in the window, page or report.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Regles.gif)

### Displaying the rulers
<a name="displaying_the_rulers_ELTPARAGRAPHE000028"></a>

To display the rulers, go to the "Display" tab, "Help for edit" group and check "Rulers".

Two types of guides can be used:

- The guides, used to align and to arrange the controls inside the windows, pages or reports.

- The border guides, used to define a border of identical size on each side of the window, page or report.




**Remark**: To show or hide the guides in the window, page or report, select or deselect "Show guides" in the context menu of the rulers.

**Guides enabled**
Whether they are visible or not, the guides are always enabled: a control moved with the mouse toward a marker is automatically snapped by the corresponding guide.

Once the control is attached to the guide, all the controls attached to this guide are automatically moved when the guide is moved.

Note: A control moved with the keyboard keys toward a marker is not always attached to the corresponding guide. Indeed, this operation is performed to the nearest pixel.

## Special case: The border markers
<a name="special_case_the_border_markers_ELTTEXTE000305"></a>


### Definition and move
<a name="definition_and_move_ELTPARAGRAPHE000136"></a>

The border markers are used to define a "margin" in the current window (page or report). The border markers are located at the extremities of rulers.

To move the left or right margin, point to a border marker on the horizontal ruler. When the pointer turns into a double arrow, move the margin.

To move the top or bottom margin, point to a border marker on the vertical ruler. When the pointer turns into a double arrow, move the margin.

### Remarks
<a name="remarks_ELTPARAGRAPHE000147"></a>

- **The border markers cannot be deleted**. If the borders are not required in a window or in a report, the border markers can be reduced to their minimum size.

- **By default, the border markers found on the opposite sides are tied**: when moving a border marker on one side, the border marker on the opposite side is moved accordingly.
	To only modify one of the border markers in the window editor, you must:

	1. Click the border marker: the mouse cursor turns into a double arrow.

	2. Press and hold the Ctrl key.

	3. Move the border marker with the mouse.
