## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000214"></a>
WDInst is used to configure the installation of files:

- Create a shortcut for each file installed (with a command line if necessary).

- Manage the collisions when updating the application (replace or not the existing files).

- Save the replaced files when the application is updated (automatic backup of existing files).




The characteristics of file setup are configured in the setup editor WDInst. To start WDInst, go to the "Tools" tab, "Utilities" group and click "WDInst".

Unlike the setup program creation wizard, WDInst includes advanced options to configure the files to install.

## Creating a shortcut
<a name="creating_shortcut_ELTTEXTE000238"></a>
For each file to install, WDInst allows you to create:

- A shortcut on the desktop of the setup computer.

- A shortcut in a group of programs.

- A shortcut in the launch bar.




By default, for each executable installed, a shortcut will be created:

- on the desktop of setup computer.

- in a group of programs.

- in the taskbar.




**Remark**: The caption of shortcuts will be created in the runtime language of setup program.

### Creating a shortcut
<a name="creating_shortcut_ELTPARAGRAPHE000055"></a>

To create a shortcut: 

1. Select the desired file in the "List of setup files" window.

2. Go to the "Shortcut" tab of the "File description" window. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Parametrer_caract_installation_fichier%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif)


3. Check the desired option: 

	- "Create a shortcut on the desktop" to create the application shortcut on the user's desktop. 

	- "Create a shortcut in a program group" to create the shortcut in the specified group. 

	- "Create a shortcut in the taskbar" to create the shortcut in the Windows taskbar. 
			All these options can be cumulated. 




4. Enter the caption of the shortcut in each language supported by the setup program.

5. Enter (if necessary) the group of programs where the shortcut must be created.
	**Remark**: This group of programs will be created if it does not exist on the user computer.

6. Specify (if necessary) the parameters of the shortcut. The execution of this shortcut will start a command line. 
	For example, the command line: "C:\\MyDirectory\\MyApplication.EXE /Login = Bill" contains:

	- The full path of the file associated with the shortcut.
			In our example: "C:\\MyDirectory\\MyApplication.EXE".

	- The shortcut parameters.
			In our example: "/Login = Bill".

## Managing the collisions
<a name="managing_the_collisions_ELTTEXTE000268"></a>
By default, when updating an application, if files with the same already exist in the installation directory, these files are replaced (except if the files already found on the computer are more recent than the ones found in the setup). 
No warning window is displayed to confirm these replacements.

WDInst is used to configure the setup program to:

- Install the files even if files with the same name and more recent are found in the setup directory.

- Avoid installing the files if files with the same name are found in the setup directory.

- Ask the user to confirm whether the files must be replaced or not.

- Rename the existing files.

### Managing the collisions

To manage the collisions:

1. Select the desired file(s) in the "List of setup files" window.
	To select several files simultaneously, hold the Ctrl or Shift key down when selecting files.

2. Display the "Version" tab of the "File description" window: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Parametrer_caract_installation_fichier%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.gif)


	- To avoid installing the selected files if files with the same name are found in the setup directory, check "Don't install if the file already exists (no other checks will be performed)".

- To replace the existing file(s) (even if they are more recent), check "Replace the file even if it is more recent". 

- To request confirmation from the user to replace the selected file(s), check "Ask for confirmation before replacing the file".

- To rename the existing files in the installation directory before installing new files, check "Rename the replaced file to the name specified below". Enter the name and extension of the replaced file.
			For example: MyImage_Bak.GIF".
			**Remark**: This operation must be performed for each replaced file that must be renamed.

## Saving the replaced files
<a name="saving_the_replaced_files_ELTTEXTE000298"></a>
When updating an application, an additional plane can be included in the setup program. This additional plane allows the user to save the replaced files in a backup directory. This backup directory will be named "Backup_&lt;BackupDate&gt;_&lt;BackupTime&gt;" by default.

This backup can be used if the setup fails for example. To use this backup, the user will have to copy the files found in the backup directory into the installation directory of application.

The backup of replaced files is proposed by default to the users.

### Proposing the backup of replaced files
<a name="proposing_the_backup_replaced_files_ELTPARAGRAPHE000156"></a>

To propose the backup of replaced files: 

1. In the setup editor WDInst: select "Setup settings .. Wizard".

2. Check "Propose to save the elements replaced with the setup program". <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Info_affiches_install%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)

	When installing the application, the user will be able to:

	- Choose to save the replaced files.

	- Modify the backup directory proposed by default.
