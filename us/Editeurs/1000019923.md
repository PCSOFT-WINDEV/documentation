## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000123"></a>
iOS requires that applications be signed. 

The generation wizard offers multiple options: 

- **Automatic signature**: This signature mode is based on a "Provisioning Profile" file, generated by Apple and available in the Apple development portal. The data not specified in the file used is defined by default by Xcode during the compilation.
	This option is recommended if the Apple account used for deploying the application is configured on the Mac used for compilation. In this case, the Apple account manager gives all the permissions to the developer when compiling on the Mac.

- **Manual signature**: This signature mode is based on two "Provisioning Profile" files (file used for the development and file used for the distribution), generated by Apple and available in the Apple development portal.
	This option is recommended if the Apple account is not configured on the Mac used for compilation. In this case, the Apple account manager will not give all the permissions to the developer.
	This signature mode is available for both iOS and Mac Catalyst. 

- **Signature in XCode**: This signature mode is used to perform the signature in Xcode, when compiling the iOS project generated by WINDEV Mobile.

### Overview
<a name="overview_ELTPARAGRAPHE000028"></a>

The automatic and manual signatures suggested by the wizard require specific files. These files must be downloaded from the Apple development portal ([https://developer.apple.com/membercenter/index.action](https://developer.apple.com/membercenter/index.action)). 

- If you choose the automatic management, a single "Provisioning profile" (distribution OR development) is required. 

- If you choose the manual management, two "Provisioning profile" (distribution AND development) are required. The signature information is more precise.

If you choose to sign the application in Xcode, the WINDEV Mobile wizard generates the Xcode project corresponding to the iOS application. The operations required to perform the signature are presented in [Compiling a WINDEV Mobile project in Xcode](../Editeurs/1000019878.md).
