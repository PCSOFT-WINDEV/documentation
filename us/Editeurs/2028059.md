The management of users allows you to find out from the server:

- the users currently connected to the application, 

- for each connected user:

	- the computer used to start the application, 

	- the version of the application used.

To view the characteristics about the users of an application on the server:

1. Start the WDADMINEXE application found in the INSTALL sub-directory of the setup directory on the server.

2. Display the "Users" tab.

### If you choose not to include the management of users
<a name="you_choose_not_include_the_management_users_ELTPARAGRAPHE000043"></a>

If the management of users is not included in the setup program, WDADMINEXE will still be installed on the server. However:

- the LOKxxx.tmp files will not be created, 

- the "Users" tab will be grayed, 

- the remote control of the application will be available. The remote check allows you to disconnect the users at any time. For more details, see [Checking the WINDEV executables remotely](../WDAdminExe/2028052.md).
