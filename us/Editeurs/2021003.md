## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000161"></a>
The "Find/Replace" feature is used to:

- Find a specified expression in the entire current project.

- Replace the expressions found in the curernt project by another expression.




Remark: a search can also be performed on several projects. For more details, see [Multi-project search](../Editeurs/2021009.md).

### Performing a search in the current project
<a name="performing_search_the_current_project_ELTPARAGRAPHE000033"></a>

To perform a search in the current project:

1. Display the ["Find - Replace" pane](../Editeurs/2027013.md).

2. In the "Find" list, enter the expression to find.

3. Specify the elements in which the search must be performed ("In" list). You have the ability to perform a default search or an advanced search.

4. Specify the search criteria ("Contains", "Starts with", "Case sensitive", ...).

5. Click the ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Ico_rech.gif)
 icon to start the search. If elements are found, the reference of these elements is displayed in the "Find - Replace" pane. To directly access one of the elements found, double-click the element reference.




**Remark**: The search does not take into account the characteristics of the analysis or the characteristics of the UML model associated with the project.

### Type of search
<a name="type_search_ELTPARAGRAPHE000079"></a>

Several types of search are available:

- **Default search**: The default search can be performed either in the source code of the active element, or in the entire active element (source code, code messages, controls, items, dependencies and multilingual options), or in the entire project. The options of the default search are selected in the "Find - Replace" pane.

- **Advanced search**: The advanced search enables you to specify the project elements in which the search must be performed, as well as the scope of the search (the options of the element in which the search must be performed). To perform an advanced search, select &lt;Advanced...&gt; in the "In" option of the "Find - Replace" pane.

### Search criteria
<a name="search_criteria_ELTPARAGRAPHE000089"></a>

Regardless of the type of search performed, you can specify a combination of the following search criteria:

- Contains: the searched expression must contain the specified expression.

- Starts with: the searched expression starts with the specified expression.

- Whole word: the searched expression corresponds exactly to the specified expression.

- Case sensitive: the search takes the uppercase and lowercase characters into account.

- Respect the accented characters: the search takes the accented characters into account.

- Ignore comments: the search ignores the comments (code comments starting with //).

### Marking the result of a search
<a name="marking_the_result_search_ELTPARAGRAPHE000103"></a>

You have the ability to mark the result of a search: all the elements found in the code will correspond to a positioning mark.

To set a mark on a search result, simply click the ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Ico_rech_marq.gif)
 icon before starting the search.
