## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000191"></a>
By default, the setup program installs all the specified files on the setup computer.

WDInst allows you to propose several setup models:

- Full setup.

- Minimum setup.

- Custom setup.




For each setup model, WDInst allows you to specify the groups of files to install. These groups are called **"components"**. Installing a component can be mandatory or optional (for example, the "Tutorial" component could be required to install the files related to the tutorial). Each component can be associated with one or more setup models.

By default, no component is created and the user cannot choose a specific setup model (all the application files will be automatically installed).

**Caution: The components proposed by the setup editor have no link with the components created by WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile**. The setup components are only used to group the files by theme.

### Characteristics of a setup component
<a name="characteristics_setup_component_ELTPARAGRAPHE000030"></a>

A setup component can be:

- **required**. The files associated with this component will be automatically installed on the setup computer regardless of the selected type of setup.

- **associated with one or more models of setup**:

	- *Full setup*: the files associated with this component will be installed on the setup computer only if a full setup is performed.

	- *Minimum setup*: the files associated with this component will be installed on the setup computer only if a minimum setup is performed.

	- *Custom setup*: when a custom setup is performed, the user will have the ability to choose whether he wants to install or not the files associated with this component.

### Managing the setup components and the setup models
<a name="managing_the_setup_components_and_the_setup_models_ELTPARAGRAPHE000082"></a>

The setup components and the setup models are managed in the setup editor WDInst: on the "Tools" tab, in the "Utilities" group, click "WDInst".



The setup program creation wizard does not allow you to manage the setup components and to offer several models of setup to the user.

### Creating a new setup component
<a name="creating_new_setup_component_ELTPARAGRAPHE000104"></a>

To create a new setup component: 

1. Click the "New" button in the "List of components" window.

2. In the table, enter the caption of the component in all the languages supported by the setup program.

3. Select the component in the table and specify its characteristics (mandatory component, full setup, ...) via the "Properties" button.

### Associating one or more files to a setup component
<a name="associating_one_more_files_setup_component_ELTPARAGRAPHE000115"></a>

To associate one or more files with a setup component: 

1. Select the files to associate in the list of setup files (top section of window). 
	To select several files simultaneously, hold the Ctrl or Shift key down when selecting files.

2. Select the associated component in the "List of components" window. If the file is associated with the setup component, the box found in front of the name of the component must be checked.




**Remarks**:

- The same file can be associated with several setup components.

- The "Component" column found in the list of setup files allows you to easily view the files of a component.
