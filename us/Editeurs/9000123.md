	 This feature is kept for backward compatibility. It is preferable to use an HFSQL database..

## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000169"></a>
The databases available for Android applications are: 

- HFSQL (Classic and Client/Server), 

- SQLite. 
	To use an SQLite database, an SQLite connection must be declared in the data model editor.





### Creating an SQLite connection
<a name="creating_sqlite_connection_ELTPARAGRAPHE000022"></a>

An SQLite connection can be created: 

- When creating the analysis: when you create an analysis for an Android application, the proposed database is either SQLite, or HFSQL (Classic or Client/Server). If you select "SQLite", the wizard automatically creates a connection used to manage and access this type of data file. The wizard allows you to enter the advanced parameters of this connection: 

	- Name of the file containing the database. 

	- Directory of the database. 




- In the data model editor: on the "Analysis" tab, in the "Analysis" group, click "Connections". Simply add a connection to an SQLite database and specify its characteristics. 




When the connection is created, you will be able to use all the WLanguage functions for handling the data files as well as the possibilities of link with the controls. 

The SQLite databases ca be accessed from WINDEV or WEBDEV via the Native SQLite Access. Therefore, you have the ability to exchange data between the database of your WINDEV "Back Office" and the mobile database.

## Transferring data from a WINDEV application to an Android application

### Copying an SQLite database from the PC to the mobile device
<a name="copying_sqlite_database_from_the_the_mobile_device_ELTPARAGRAPHE000057"></a>

When an SQLite data file is created by an Android application, the SQLite database is created in the "/data/data/com.&lt;mycompany&gt;.&lt;projectname#XGTXLT#base&gt;.db" directory. 

This directory cannot be accessed from the PC: the Android system does not give access to this data. 

To transfer an SQLite database found on the development computer to an Android device, the database can be added into the apk archive of the application. This operation can be performed when creating the Android archive, in the "Integrating files" screen.

This file can be installed on the Android phone as soon as the application is started by [fExtractResource](../WDLang1/1000019509.md). For example, to install the database in the default directory of Android databases: 


```wl
fExtractResource("MyPCDatabase.db", CompleteDir(fDataDir()) + "Database.db")
```



### Copying the SQLite Android database onto the SD Card
<a name="copying_the_sqlite_android_database_onto_the_card_ELTPARAGRAPHE000074"></a>

When an SQLite data file is created by an Android application, the SQLite database is created in the "/data/data/com.&lt;mycompany&gt;.&lt;projectname#XGTXLT#base&gt;.db" directory. 

To ignore this limit, we recommend that you use the SD Card of the mobile device to store the data. 

To do so, you must modify the characteristics of the connection used, by specifying the directory of the SD Card. This operation must be performed through programming. For example: 


```wl
gcntSQLite is Connection = MyAndroidFile.Connection
gcntSQLite.Source = CompleteDir(SysDirStorageCard()) + "Database.db"
gcntSQLite.Provider = hNativeAccessSQLite
```
This file will be accessible from the PC when the mobile device is connected to the PC. Therefore, you will be able to perform copies of the database from the PC to the mobile device (and conversely).

## Transferring SQLite data from an Android application to a WINDEV application
<a name="transferring_sqlite_data_from_android_application_windev_application_ELTTEXTE000235"></a>


### SQLite data found in the database directory of the Mobile device
<a name="sqlite_data_found_the_database_directory_the_mobile_device_ELTPARAGRAPHE000090"></a>

If the SQLite data to transfer is found in the default data directory of the Mobile device, the transfer must be performed by the Android application by using HTTTP requests (AWP service), an FTP transfer or via sockets. 


### SQLite data found on the SD Card of the Mobile device
<a name="sqlite_data_found_the_card_the_mobile_device_ELTPARAGRAPHE000095"></a>

In this case, all you have to do is copy the SQLite data from the SD Card (visible like a Windows disk) to the PC and include the data in the WINDEV application. 


### Remark: Creating an Android emulator with a SD Card
<a name="remark_creating_android_emulator_with_card_ELTPARAGRAPHE000100"></a>

For your tests, you have the ability to create a SD Card in the Android emulator: 

1. Start a command console window in Windows ("Start .. CMD"). 

2. Position yourself in the "tools" directory of the Android SDK used. 

3. Use the following command line (for a SD Card of 256 MB):
	
	```txt
	mksdcard.exe 256M c:\temp\sdcard.img
	```


4. In WINDEV Mobile, when starting the emulator, modify the command line as follows: 
	
	```txt
	-no-boot-anim –partition-size 128 –sdcard c:\temp\sdcard.img
	```

## Example
<a name="example_ELTTEXTE000271"></a>
The following example allows you to use an SQLite database on Android with access to the database from a PC during the connection of the device in USB. The database is stored on the SD Card of the device. 


```wl
// CntSQLiteDatabase is the name of the connection defined in the analysis

// Directories on the SD Card for accessing the SQLite database
sDataDirectory is string 
sDataDirectory = "data_wm_androidsqlitedatabasesharepc"

// Name of the SQLite database
sNameSQLiteDatabase is string = "wm_sqlitedatabase.db"

// Unit corresponding to the SD Card of the Android device 
// (from a Windows application)
// To be asked to the user 
// and to be stored in a parameter file
sUnitSDCardFromPC is string = "e:"

// In any case, the database is in SQLite format
CntSQLiteDatabase.Provider = hNativeAccessSQLite

// Execution on the Android device?
IF InAndroidMode() = True THEN
	// yes
	// WINDEV Mobile simulator?
	IF InSimulatorMode() = True THEN
		// Database in the Exe directory of the project		
		CntSQLiteDatabase.Source = fExeDir() + ["\"] + sNameSQLiteDatabase
	ELSE	
		// Execution on the Android device or on the emulator 
		// There should be a storage card, 
		// checks whether it is available
		IF SysStatusStorageCard() = sysCardAvailable THEN
			// Localizes the database on the SD Card, 
			// in relation to the mobile
			CntSQLiteDatabase.Source = SysDirStorageCard() + ["/"] + ...
				sDataDirectory + ["/"] + sNameSQLiteDatabase
		ELSE
			// No storage card
			Error("No storage card available in write mode.")
			EndProgram()
		END
	END
ELSE
	// Execution on a PC?	
	IF InAndroidEmulatorMode() = True _OR_ IniOSEmulatorMode = True THEN
		Error("No access to the database is provided on this platform")
		EndProgram()
	ELSE
		// IF SysWindowsVersion() IN ("98","NT 3.5","NT 4", ...
		// "NT 5","ME", "2003S","2008S","VISTA","7")  THEN
		// localizes the database on the SD Card, in relation to the PC
		CntSQLiteDatabase.Source = sUnitSDCardFromPC + ["\"] + ...
			sDataDirectory + ["\"] + sNameSQLiteDatabase
	END
END

// Open the connection
IF HOpenConnection(CntSQLiteDatabase) = False THEN
	Error("Failure connecting to the SQLite Android database", ...
			HErrorInfo())
	EndProgram()
END

HCreationIfNotFound("*")

Info("Connection to the database established")
