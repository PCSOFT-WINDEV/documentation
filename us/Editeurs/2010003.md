## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000218"></a>
A help system includes several pages. Pages are the main elements of a help system. When users open the help, they are taken to a help page.

Several types of help pages can be implemented in a help file, let's see the most common ones:

- **context-sensitive help pages**: the content of the help page gives information about the use of a specific window. Generally, this type of help page is opened via the help icon ("?") in the window.

- **"How to" help pages**: these help pages describe step by step the different actions required to perform an operation.

- **"Conceptual" help pages**: these help pages present a concept or an idea and define the terms used.




There are [links](../Editeurs/2010023.md) between the different pages. These links allow users to navigate the help system.

**Remark**: To automatically generate help pages corresponding to the different elements of the project (windows and reports), on the "Modification" tab, in the "Help system" group, click "Generate help pages of the project".
