## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000134"></a>
A query is used to interrogate a database in order to view, insert, modify or delete data. The query structure defines the data used.

A query can interrogate one or more data files.

The query editor allows you to easily create queries without programming.

**For example**, in the Sales Management application, you want to find out:

- the orders placed in March 2015. You are going to create a query used to select the orders placed between 03/01/2015 and 03/31/2015 in the ORDERS file.
	The QRY_March2015 query interrogates the ORDERS file.

- the numbers of the orders placed by customers who live in Paris (France). You are going to create a query that will interrogate:

	- the CUSTOMER file to select the customers who live in Paris (France). 

	- the ORDERS file to display the order numbers.







The QRY_OrdersCustomerParisFrance query interrogates two data files (CUSTOMER and ORDERS).
