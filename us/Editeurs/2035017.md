## Overview

A sequence diagram represents the chronological order of messages sent and received by a set of objects.

For example, the following diagram represents the beginning of a phone call:<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_UML_Diagramme_sequence%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)

## Elements of a sequence diagram
<a name="elements_sequence_diagram_ELTTEXTE000107"></a>
A sequence diagram includes the following elements:

- **object**: represents the different objects used. Each object is represented by a square at the top of a dotted line. This line represents the object lifespan. For example: "Caller", "Callee", etc.

- **object activation period**: You can insert activation periods into the lifeline of an object. These periods indicate when the object is active.

- **message**: represents, via horizontal arrows, the message exchanged between the different objects. These arrows are oriented from the sender to the recipient. The order in which the messages are sent is given by the position of the arrows on the vertical axis. 
	For example: "Picks up", "Ring", etc.

- **package**: divides and organizes the diagram representation (in the same way that directories organize files).
