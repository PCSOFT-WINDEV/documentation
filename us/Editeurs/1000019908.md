## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000310"></a>
Several steps must be performed to develop an iPhone/iPad application: 

- [Creating and developing the project in WINDEV Mobile](../Editeurs/1000019818.md). 

- [Generating the application](#NOTE2_1). 

- [Compiling in Xcode](../Editeurs/1000019878.md). 


**Caution**: Since April 2020, deployment to App Store requires WINDEV Mobile 25.

### Generating the application
<a name="generating_the_application_ELTPARAGRAPHE000034"></a>

To generate the application that must be compiled on MAC: 

1. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_generation_IOS.gif)
 in the quick access buttons. The generation wizard starts. 
	Remark: If the current configuration does not correspond to the iOS application, expand the generation icon in the quick access buttons, click "Other generations" and select "Generate the iPhone/iPad application".

2. In the application generation wizard, specify the general information about the application to create: 

	- Application name

	- Company

	- Copyright

	- Bundle ID. This ID is a unique identifier for Apple applications. It is defined and registered on the Apple developer account. 
			This identifier will allow you to register your application so that it can be tested and deployed. By default, WINDEV Mobile automatically generates an identifier that meets Apple's development requirements. You can change this ID. 
			For more details on this identifier, see the [iOS documentation](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/ApplicationDevelopmentOverview/ConfigureYourProject/ConfigureYourProject.html|). 




3. Go to the next step. 

4. Specify the path of the different application icons: iPad, iPhone and iPad Retina icons, ...
	Remark: The "Optional icons" button is used to specify the path of additional icons.

5. Go to the next step.

6. Choose the launch image management mode.
	There are two launch image management modes.
	You can:
	

	- Use the new management system: allows resizing the application (Split View).

	- Use the former management system: supports all the iOS versions but does not allow you to resize the application (Split View).




7. Go to the next step.

8. If you have chosen to use:

	- the new launch image management system, specify:

		- the elements that will be displayed in the splash screen:

			- the application name.

			- the application version.

			- the message displayed when loading the application.

			- if necessary, the image of the application logo in the splash screen.

			- whether an animation will be used when loading the splash screen.

			- the background image of the splash screen if necessary. In this case, specify the background image and its display mode. 
										You can retrieve the background image and its display mode before starting the wizard, by clicking "Reinitialize the background image".




- the style of splash screen: the color of captions and the background color.

- the former launch image management system: specify the path of the different images used to start the application for iPhone then for iPad. These images are in PNG format. Default images are automatically created for your application.

- the two launch image management systems: the steps for choosing the parameters of the new and the former launch image management systems are displayed.

9. Go to the next step.

10. Specify the version number of generated application. This format corresponds to a set of 4 numbers separated by dots.

	- The first group of 4 digits corresponds to the number of major changes performed in the application.

	- The second group of 4 digits corresponds to the number of minor changes performed in the application.

	- The third group of 4 digits corresponds to the generation number.
			We advise you to automatically increment this number at each generation. This increment operation is automatically performed if the option "Automatically increment the version at each generation" is checked.

	- The last group of 4 digits corresponds to the number of reviews (branches in the SCM for example).




11. Go to the next step.

12. Specify (if necessary) the external libraries to include. 

	- These libraries can be system libraries or non-system libraries. 

	- These libraries may be required if you have entered native Objective C code that uses specific libraries, for example. For more details, see [Using Objective C code](../Editeurs/1000019887.md).
			Remark: You also have the ability to add an external framework. All you have to do is expand the "Add" button and select "Add an external framework". Then, you have the ability to select the ".framework" directory containing the external library. 




13. Go to the next step.

14. Specify whether files must be included in the executable. You can include:

	- specific resources.

	- specific images.

	- data files. 




15. Specify the options of the files: 

	- **If the "Write" option is checked for the files**, they will be automatically extracted (e.g., files that must be modified by the application). In this case, specify the application directory into which this file must be extracted ("Documents" directory or "Library" directory). 

	- **If the "Write" option is unchecked for the files**, they can be:

		- used directly (files that will only be read, for example: sound files, image files, etc.). These files are included in the application and will not be extracted. [fResourceDir](../WDLang1/1000020166.md) is used to access these files in read-only mode.  

		- extracted programmatically with [fExtractResource](../WDLang1/1000019509.md). 
						**Caution**: the iOS system is case-sensitive. 




16. Go to the next step.

17. If your application contains an HTML control, you must meet the security requirements in an iOS application version 9.0 (and later). By default, HTML controls allow access only to sites that use an HTTPS connection in line with Apple's recommendations. This step is used to: 

	- provide the list of domains for which the security can be disabled. You must specify: 

		- the domain name (windev.com for example). 

		- the minimum TLS version for the HTTPS connections. All the connections greater than or equal to the selected version are allowed. If "Default" is selected, the minimum TLS version depends on the Xcode version. 

		- if the non-secure HTTP connection is allowed. 

		- whether the subdomains must be included. 




- disable the security for all the domains ("Disable the security for all the domains" option).

18. Go to the next step.

19. Specify the configuration options: 

	- **Split View**
			The " Enable resizing (Split View) " option allows the end user to display two windows of two different apps side by side on iPAD Air 2. 

	- **File Sharing** 
			If the "Enable File Sharing" option is checked, you will be able to get the app files on the PC when synchronization is run. 
			For example, if the application contains data files, iTunes will allow you to copy these files. To do so: 

		- Connect the mobile device. 

		- In iTunes, click "Apps" and choose your application. 

		- The list of files is displayed. A simple Drag and Drop allows you to add or retrieve files. 




- **Deployment target**
			Specify the minimum iOS version required to run the application. 
			Remark: The minimum supported version is iOS 11.0.

- **Execution in the background**
			This option appears only if [GPSFollowMovement](../WDLang3/1000019206.md) and/or [BeaconDetectPrecise](../WDLang3/1000023115.md) are used in the application. The option "Allow the GPSFollowMovelent and BeaconDetectPrecise functions to be called when the application is in background." allows geolocation and/or the precise detection of beacons to keep running when the device is in standby.

- **Dynamic Island**
			The " Include the native files needed to generate Live Activities for the Dynamic Island.
Requires Xcode 14.1 or later. " option is used to indicate that the application must include the files necessary for managing a Dynamic Island. The names of the necessary structures and files must be specified on the following wizard screen .  
			Caution: If this option is checked, it is necessary to use Xcode 14.1 or later. 
			Reminder: Dynamic Island is a way of using the area where the sensors and selfie camera are integrated.. From iPhone 14 onwards, the notch is part of the screen. The code used to manage Dynamic Island is a native code entered in Swift.

20. Go to the next step.

21. The "Signature" step is used to choose the signature mode of your iOS application. For more details, see [Signature of iOS applications](../Editeurs/1000019923.md). Go to the next step. 

22. **If your iOS application is published on the App Store**, a text must be specified for each feature used. The first time the end user uses any of these features, an authorization window will display this description.  

24. Validate the wizard. A project configuration is created if necessary. The application is generated in the EXE folder of the project directory. **The directory containing the sources that will be used on the Mac is named "Project_Name.xcode.gen"**. This directory must be copied onto the MAC. 
	Remark: The generation folder can be opened directly in the file explorer: on the "Home" tab, in the "General" group, expand ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Rep_Projet.gif)
 and select "Browse generation directory". 





### Content of the generation directory "Project_name.xcode.gen"
<a name="content_the_generation_directory_projectnamexcodegen_ELTPARAGRAPHE000243"></a>

The generation directory contains the following elements: 

- A **lib** directory. This directory contains the WINDEV Mobile framework for iOS with: 

	- a **libwd\*.xcframework** folder containing the framework for an iOS application,

	- an **extwd\*.xcframework** folder containing the framework for a widget up to iOS 13,

	- a **widwd\*.xcframework** folder containing the framework for a widget starting with iOS 14.




- A directory named like the project containing: 

	- The .WDL library of the project objects. This library is identical to the library generated in WINDEV or WEBDEV.

	- Several files required by the xCode compiler on the MAC (main.m, WDAppDelegate.h, WDAppDelegate.mm, Info.plist).




- A folder named **&lt;Project name&gt;.xcodeproj**. In this folder, the project.pbxproj file corresponds to the project that must be opened in Xcode on the MAC.
