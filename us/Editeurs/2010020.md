## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000131"></a>
The help editor options allow you to define:

- the different help compilers used ("General" tab).

- the check performed on the help system when it is opened ("General" tab).

- the quality of the images generated during the compilation ("Images" tab).

- the images inserted into a page ("Images" tab).




To view the options of the help editor, on the "Home" tab, in the "Environment" group, expand "Options" and select "Options of the help editor".

- Help compiler: WINDEV includes two help compilers:

	- **WinHelp compiler**: this compiler corresponds to the **hcrtf.exe** program. This program is included in the "Programs" subdirectory of the WINDEV installation directory.

	- **HTML Help compiler**: this compiler corresponds to the **hhc.exe** program. This program is included in the "Programs" subdirectory of the WINDEV installation directory.


 **Remark**: To compile and test your HLP or CHM help files, the paths to both compilers must be specified.

- Integrity of the help system: If a problem occurs when opening the help system, you have the ability to check (and correct) the help system as soon as it is opened. Simply check "Check the integrity of the help system when loading".
	**Caution**: This operation may be quite long. It should be used before opening a help system that causes problems, and then it should be unchecked.

## Options of the "Images" tab

The "Images" tab includes the following options: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=option_editeur_aide%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif&type=thumb)


- Quality of the JPEG images (CHM format only): When the help system is created in the help editor, all types of images can be inserted into your help pages. However, when compiling in CHM format, all the images used will be automatically converted into JPEG format. Indeed, this compressed format is used to optimize the size of your help files.
	The help editor of WINDEV allows you to choose the quality of the JPEG images created during the compilation.
	You should use a quality rate included between 50 and 70 %.
	**Caution**: The higher the image quality is, the clearer the images will be, but the larger the compiled CHM file will be.

- Managing the insertion of an image into a help page: Several options are available when an image is inserted into a help page: 

	- **Ask for each image whether it must be copied in to the project directory**.

	- **Always copy the images into the project directory**: this option is used to store all the images used by the help file in the project directory.

	- **Never copy the images into the project directory**:  all the images used by the help file remain in their source directory. If these images are no longer available when the help file is compiled, a white square will be displayed in the help file.
