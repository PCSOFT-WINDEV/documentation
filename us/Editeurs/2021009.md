## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000148"></a>
Performing a search in the current project is a common operation: search for a caption, search for a control name, ... This search can be performed:

- via the "project Explorer" pane, 

- via the ["Find/Replace" pane](../Editeurs/2027013.md),




It may also be useful to perform a search in different projects (to search for a procedure used in another project for example). This search can be performed in any type of project (WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile).

The multi-project search allows you to perform a search in:

- specific projects, 

- all the projects found in a directory, 

- all the projects found on a disk or on a server.

### Performing a multi-project search
<a name="performing_multiproject_search_ELTPARAGRAPHE000041"></a>

To perform a multi-project search:

1. Select "Workshop .. Multi-project search...". The window for configuring the search directories is displayed.

2. Specify the directories, disks or projects affected by the search:

	- the "Directory" button is used to select the projects found in a directory or on a disk. All the WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile projects found at this location will be taken into account. The search is also performed in the subdirectories of the specified locations. A UNC path can be specified.

	- the "Project" button is used to add a specific project (WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile). Different types of projects can be added (a WINDEV project and a WINDEV Mobile project for example).




3. Validate. The "Find - Replace" pane is automatically displayed and enabled in the editor (if necessary).

4. In the "Find - Replace" pane, enter:

	- the word or the expression to find, 

	- the search criteria (contains, whole word, ...).




5. Start the search (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Ico_rech.gif)). If elements are found, the reference of these elements is displayed in the "Find - Replace" pane.




Remark: The multi-project search can also be performed from the "Find - Replace" pane. To do so, select the "In &lt;Multi-project&gt;" option to configure the search directories.

### Handling the result of the search
<a name="handling_the_result_the_search_ELTPARAGRAPHE000064"></a>

The result of the multi-project search is displayed in the "Find - Replace" pane. The results are grouped by project.

The following information is specified for each element found:

- its location, 

- its value.




The context menu of the search result is used to:

- copy the list of elements found to the clipboard.

- print the list of elements found.




To directly access one of the elements found, double-click the location of the element.

**Remark**: If the element found belongs to a project other than the current project:

- if the project was developed with the same product, the project is opened in a new instance of the product.

- if the project was developed with a different product, the project is opened in the associated product.
