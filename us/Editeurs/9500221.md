<a name="configuring_the_dashboard_ELTTEXTE000485"></a>
You can use a context menu to configure and customize your project dashboard (right click in an empty dashboard area). ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=TDB_Prj_MenuCtx.gif)
This context menu is mainly used to: 

- Change to edit mode: The "Modification" mode allows you to configure the different widgets. You can:

	- move the widgets: Simply select the desired widget, keep the left mouse button down and move the widget to the desired location. 

	- display new widgets: all you have to do is reopen the context menu of the dashboard and select "Add". The available widgets are proposed and they can be selected. 

	- hide the useless widgets: all you have to do is open the context menu of widget to hide and select "Hide". The widget is immediately deleted from the dashboard. 

	- restore the initial configuration (before switching to edit mode). 


 Remark: To exit from the "Modification" mode, all you have to do is reselect "Modification mode" in the context menu of dashboard.

- Animate the widgets: This option is used to get an animation effect when the widget is updated. 

- Refresh the dashboard: This option is used to update the dashboard according to the last modifications performed in the project. 




Most of the widgets propose their own options.
