## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000339"></a>
The "Project explorer" pane is used to simplify the development environment of WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=VoletExplorateurProjet.gif)
This pane is used to:

- list the project elements.

- list the analysis elements.

- list procedures, classes, etc.

- list external descriptions.

- search the current project.

## Features of "Project explorer" pane
<a name="features_project_explorer_pane_ELTTEXTE000363"></a>


### General operations in the "Project explorer" pane
<a name="general_operations_the_project_explorer_pane_ELTPARAGRAPHE000026"></a>

The "Project explorer" pane shows the project elements and, if necessary, the associated "subelements". 

You have the ability to Drag and Drop the selected elements toward the environment. For example, you can Drag and Drop a global variable into a window in order to create an edit control.

You can also Drag and Drop elements into the "Project explorer" pane: for example, an element can be moved into a custom-folder or into an internal component.

![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_synchro_explorateur.gif) allows you to position the selection bar in the "Project explorer" pane on the current element in the editor.

### Managing the project and its elements
<a name="managing_the_project_and_its_elements_ELTPARAGRAPHE000040"></a>

All the project elements are grouped in the "Project explorer" pane. A double click performed on the element name allows you to display it in the environment.

**The context menu of the project** (right click on the "P" icon) allows you to perform the most common operations on the project:

- Display the project description,

- Recompile the project,

- Create a new element,

- List all project elements,

- ...




Each project element includes its own popup menu that proposes all the features available for this element. For example, on a window or page, you can: 

- open the element in the corresponding editor,

- test the element, 

- duplicate the element,

- view the codes of the element, etc.




**The "Configuration" element** is used to manage the [project configurations](../Editeurs/9000030.md). The popup menu is used to add a new configuration or to manage the existing configurations. The elements that do not belong to the selected configuration are grayed out in the "Project explorer" pane.

**For windows and reports**, the "Project explorer" pane lists the controls in the selected element as well as the local variables and the local procedures.

**For queries,** the "Project explorer" pane lists the result items of the query as well as its parameters.

**The "Procedures" category** contains the sets of procedures of the project or those of the components located in the project. The constants, the global variables and the procedures are listed for each set of procedures. The "Project explorer" pane also allows you to create procedures or sets of procedures.

**For classes**, the "Project explorer" pane lists members and methods. The "Project explorer" pane also allows you to create classes or methods.

**For internal components**, the "Project explorer" pane lists internal components and their elements. The elements are listed in a tree structure, grouped by type (windows, reports, etc.). 
Only the branches containing elements are displayed. 

The "Project explorer" pane also lists the project global variables and the analysis files and items.

### Reverse modeling and crossed references
<a name="reverse_modeling_and_crossed_references_ELTPARAGRAPHE000085"></a>

The popup menu of the project elements is used to perform a reverse modeling and/or to display the crossed references.
<a name="NOTE2_4"></a>


### Managing the analysis
<a name="managing_the_analysis_ELTPARAGRAPHE000092"></a>

The "Project explorer" pane displays the analysis of the current project, i.e. the data files and their items. The displayed analysis corresponds to the last generated analysis that can be used in the application.

**Reminder**: The "Analysis" pane displays the analysis being edited and it is used to handle the description of data files or items.

The data model editor can be opened from the "Project explorer" pane, via the context menu of data files ("Open analysis"). The data model editor opens on the data file selected in the "Project explorer" pane. This data file is also selected in the ["Analysis"](../Editeurs/2027012.md) pane.. 

To create the corresponding controls, all you have to do is Drag and Drop the items toward a window, page or report.

**Remark**: the "Project explorer" pane shows a tooltip when hovering over a composite key. This tooltip contains the components of the composite key. The plus or minus sign found in front of the component name indicates the sort direction. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Volet_Clecomp.gif)

### Perform a search with the "Project explorer" pane
<a name="perform_search_with_the_project_explorer_pane_ELTPARAGRAPHE000115"></a>

To perform a search with the "Project explorer" pane:

1. Click the ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_Rech_Loupe.gif) icon to start the search. 

2. The window for searching project elements is displayed.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CTRL_E.gif)


3. Enter the name (or part of the name) of the element you are looking for. The search is performed in all the names of project elements. The result is displayed in the search window. Double-clicking on the element opens it in the corresponding editor. 

4. For a more in-depth search, check "Find the sub-elements as well
(controls, procedures, ...)": the search result takes into account: 

	- all the references to the searched word in the WLanguage code.

	- all the references to the searched word in the content of controls (control caption, notes, etc.).

### "Other" category: including elements in the executable, library, etc.
<a name="other_category_including_elements_the_executable_library_etc_ELTPARAGRAPHE000137"></a>

You can include files (HFSQL data files, images, sounds, etc.) directly in the generated executable or archive. This allows you to use resources that must not be visible on the disk of the end user. 

To do so, simply include these resources in the project via the "Other" folder, in the "Project explorer" pane. 

Remark: Resources in the "Other" category and included in the executable library (WDL file) can be extracted using [fExtractResource](../WDLang1/1000019509.md). 

The following features are used to simplify the operations performed on the "Other" folder: 

- The "Drag and Drop" of elements to include in the "Other" folder can be performed from the Windows file explorer. 

- A popup menu on the "Other" menu is used to add or delete elements. 

- An "Other" folder is also available in each internal component, allowing you to include elements in the shared internal components. 

- The function used to perform a search in the project also browses the "Other" folder of the project. 



<a name="NOTE2_6b"></a>


### "External descriptions" category: including external descriptions in the project
<a name="external_descriptions_category_including_external_descriptions_the_project_ELTPARAGRAPHE000162"></a>
