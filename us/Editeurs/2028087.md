## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000152"></a>
The application uninstaller is the application that allows the end user to uninstall the application. 

By default: 

- the uninstaller is included in the setup program. 

- the uninstaller operates in English

- the uninstaller does not run any other program. 




WDInst is used to configure the uninstaller by allowing you to: 

- run a specific executable at the end of the uninstall operation.

- translate the different messages in WDInst. 


These settings are defined in WDInst. To start WDInst, go to the "Tools" tab, "Utilities" group and click "WDInst".

Remark: To specify in WDInst whether an uninstaller must be included or not: 

1. Select "Setup settings .. End of setup". 

2. Check or uncheck "Include the uninstaller".
