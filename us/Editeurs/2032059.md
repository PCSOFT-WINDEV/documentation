## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000152"></a>
Two methods can be used to create a query:

- creating the query with a wizard or with the description window, and generating the SQL code automatically.

- typing the SQL code. For more details, see [How to create a query in SQL code?](../Editeurs/2032060.md)




The query editor allows you to create several types of queries:

- **select query**: this type of query allows you to view a selection of records from one or more files in a database. This is the most common type of query.
	For more details, see [How to create a select query?](../Editeurs/2032062.md)

- **insert query**: this type of query is used to add records to a database file.
	For more details, see [How to create an insert query?](../Editeurs/2032058.md)

- **update query**: this type of query is used to update the records found in a database file.
	For more details, see [How to create an update query?](../Editeurs/2032057.md)

- **delete query**: this type of query is used to delete records from a database file.
	For more details, see [How to create a delete query?](../Editeurs/2032047.md)

- **combining query**: this type of query is used to combine select queries.
	For more details, see [How to create a combining query?](../Editeurs/2032035.md)

**Remark**: All types of queries can be based on items belonging:

- to a data file described in the analysis.

- a query that was previously created with the query editor.




Once created, the characteristics of this query can be modified at any time. For more details, see [Describing a query](../Editeurs/2032038.md).

### Insert query, update query and delete query:
<a name="insert_query_update_query_and_delete_query_ELTPARAGRAPHE000066"></a>

The ability to create insert, update and delete queries is supported for compatibility with the SQL standard.

Using native WINDEV commands ([HReadFirst](../WDLang4/3044051.md), [HReadNext](../WDLang4/3044037.md), [HAdd](../WDLang4/3044147.md), [HModify](../WDLang4/3044042.md), [HDelete](../WDLang4/3044018.md), ... is much better suited to programming this type of process.

SQL is a query language used to interrogate data but it is not well suited for custom modifications of this data. To add, modify or delete records in a database file, the power and simplicity of WINDEV makes it the ideal and recommended solution|   |   |   |

## Principle
<a name="principle_ELTTEXTE000236"></a>
To create a query, you must:

- specify the method used to create the query (wizard, description window or SQL code).

- specify the type of query (insert, update, ...).

- specify (if necessary) the WINDEV, WINDEV Mobile or WEBDEV analysis containing the description of data files on which the query will be based.

- select the items to use.

- enter the characteristics of the query (selection conditions, sort, ...).
