## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000139"></a>
The query editor automatically creates a technical documentation for each query. This technical documentation contains:

- the graphical representation of the query.

- the general information about the query (logical name and physical name of the query, type of query, analysis associated with the query, ...).

- the information specific to the query results (result items, query parameters, sort criteria, ...).

- the information about the query characteristics (selection conditions, groups, ...).

- the SQL code corresponding to the query.




This technical documentation can be configured. It can contain:

- the full information about the query.

- a selection of information.

<a name="editing_the_technical_documentation_current_query_the_editor_ELTPARAGRAPHE000029"></a>

To edit the technical documentation of current query in the editor:

1. On the "Home" tab, in the "General" group, expand ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_imprimer.gif) and select "Print".

2. Specify the information contained in this technical documentation.

3. Choose how the technical documentation will be generated.

4. Indicate whether this technical documentation should contain: 

	- PC Soft vocabulary, used by default. 

	- "generic" vocabulary (for example, the term "data file" will be replaced by "Table", "Item" by "Column", etc.







Remark: The print of the query representation can be configured according to:

- print areas.

- a specific layout. To define this layout, expand ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_imprimer.gif) and select "Documentation layout".

### Specifying the print areas of graphic representation 
<a name="specifying_the_print_areas_graphic_representation_ELTPARAGRAPHE000063"></a>

To specify the print areas of graphic representation:

1. On the "Display" tab, in the "Help for edit" group, check "Print areas". A series of borders that represent the printable areas in the technical documentation will appear in the query editor.

2. Reduce the display of graphic representation: on the "Display" tab, in the "Help for edit" group, modify the "Zoom" value (or use Ctrl + Mouse wheel) to see the entire query.

3. With the mouse:

	- move these borders to the desired location by keeping the mouse button down (the mouse cursor is black).

	- choose the number of pages on which the graphic representation must be printed (the mouse cursor turns into a North-West/South-East double arrow).
