## Overview

The wizard for page creation proposes several types of pages associated with HyperFileSQL data files. You have the ability to create:

- **dynamic pages**: These pages are created from the data files found on the development computer. In deployment, the data is installed (or accessible) from the Web server. The pages display the data found in the data files.

- **semi-dynamic pages**: These pages are created from the data files found on the development computer. Before installing the application, these pages are converted into static pages: the data found in the data files is saved in the pages. No data file is installed on the server.




For more details, see [Types of pages](../WDChamp/2030020.md).

## Form page
<a name="form_page_ELTTEXTE000447"></a>


### General case
<a name="general_case_ELTPARAGRAPHE000073"></a>

A **form** page displays the values of a record in a form, on the basis of one value per control. The records can be accessed one by one.

The form can:

- allow (or not) the move to the previous and next records.

- allow (or not) the creation, modification and deletion of records.



<a name="NOTE2_2"></a>


### Simple dynamic form
<a name="simple_dynamic_form_ELTPARAGRAPHE000085"></a>

This type of page is used to view and modify a record.

This type of page does not allow you to:

- browse the different records.

- create or delete a record.




A "Simple dynamic form" page is made of:

- buttons used to validate or cancel the input.

- buttons used to print the current record

- controls linked to the file items.




In most cases, the "Simple dynamic form" page is accessible from a "Simple dynamic table" page to view or modify the current record.
<a name="NOTE2_3"></a>


### Dynamic form with browse
<a name="dynamic_form_with_browse_ELTPARAGRAPHE000105"></a>

This type of page is used to:

- modify the record displayed.

- create a record.

- delete a record.

- print the current record.

- move to another record (next or previous one).




A "Dynamic form with browse" page includes:

- controls linked to the file items.

- 4 navigation buttons.

- buttons used to:

	- create a new record.

	- delete the current record.

	- print the current record.

	- close the page.







Compared to a "Simple dynamic form", a "Dynamic form with browse" proposes:

- an easy way to move from a form to another one.

- the ability to create several records in a row.




**Tip**: For the files containing several records, we advise you to select the records in a table and to modify or view the selected record in a "Simple form" page. Indeed, the selection is faster in a table.
<a name="NOTE2_4"></a>


### Dynamic form with linked table
<a name="dynamic_form_with_linked_table_ELTPARAGRAPHE000136"></a>

This type of window is used to view the content of the files linked by a simple link (1 - N) in the same page.

The values of the record found in the main file are displayed in a form. The records linked to the current record (in the main file) are displayed in a table.

This type of page includes:

- a form (in the top section) used to display the values of the current record found in the base file (main file).

	- modify a row in the table.

Remarks:

- If the file displayed in the table is a relation file, the page contains the buttons required to access the other relation file.

- If this type of page is selected for a file with no linked file (1-N link), it is signaled by WEBDEV.
