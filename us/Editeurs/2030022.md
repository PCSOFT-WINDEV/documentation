## General case: application or site associated with a library
<a name="general_case_application_site_associated_with_library_ELTTEXTE000116"></a>
A library is a WDL file that contains all WINDEV or WEBDEV resources: windows, pages, reports, classes, sets of procedures, data files, etc.

This file is opened by the executable or by the site. The necessary elements are automatically loaded when they are used. 

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) When creating the executable, the library corresponding to the project is generated. It can be included (or not) in the executable. For more details, see [Creating an executable](../Editeurs/2025002.md). 
**Remark**: For backward compatibility with version 5.5, you have the ability to create an executable without library. For more details, see [Creating an executable without library](../Editeurs/2030025.md).

## Special case: Splitting an application or site into multiple libraries
<a name="special_case_splitting_application_site_into_multiple_libraries_ELTTEXTE000140"></a>
To reduce load times when working with large projects (e.g. hundreds of windows), you can split the project into: 

- a main "Executable" or "Site" project. 

- one or more "Library" projects. Each "Library" project contains the project elements associated with a theme. 




The main project creates the main library. This library is created when creating the executable. The library contains the elements specific to the project: analysis, project, etc. The main library cannot be shared between multiple projects. It is unique for each project.

The "Library" projects create the secondary libraries of the application by grouping the application elements by theme. 

For example, a project for business management groups several hundreds of windows and reports. To optimize the loading time of the project in the editor, it is split into: 

- a main project. This project creates the main library and uses the secondary libraries. 

- a "Customer management" project. This project is used to create a secondary library. 

- an "Order management" project. This project is used to create a secondary library. 

- etc.




For more details, see [Use several libraries](../Editeurs/2030027.md). 

**Remark**: To share resources between applications or sites, it is recommend to use external or internal components. They are very easy to use. For more details, see: 

- [External components](../Editeurs/2014011.md).

- [Internal components](../Editeurs/2014100.md).
