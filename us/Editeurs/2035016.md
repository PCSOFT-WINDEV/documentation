### Creating a class diagram
<a name="creating_class_diagram_ELTPARAGRAPHE000042"></a>

To create a class diagram: 

1. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_nouveau.gif) in the quick access buttons. 

	- The new element window appears: click "Architecture", and then "UML".

	- The UML model creation wizard starts.




2. Select "Class diagram".

3. Specify the UML model into which the diagram is to be inserted.

4. Choose to edit the diagram directly.

5. Validate the new class diagram. The new model appears in the editor.




**Remark**: If you chose to create a class, the corresponding wizard starts automatically.

### Creating a class
<a name="creating_class_ELTPARAGRAPHE000062"></a>

To create a class: 

1. On the "Class diagram" tab, in the "Creation" group, click "Class". The class creation wizard starts.

2. Specify:

	- the name of the class. This name will be the name of the corresponding WINDEV class (".WDC" file) when generating the UML model.

	- the caption describing the purpose of the class.




3. Define:

	- the attributes of the class. These attributes will correspond to the members of the WINDEV class when generating the UML model.

	- the operations of the class. These operations will correspond to the methods of the WINDEV class when generating the UML model.




4. Validate the description of the class.




**Remark**: If you chose to create another class, the corresponding wizard starts automatically.

### Adding an attribute
<a name="adding_attribute_ELTPARAGRAPHE000094"></a>

To add an attribute: 

1. Select the class in which the attribute is to be added.

2. On the "Class diagram" tab, in the "Creation" group, click "Attribute". The attribute creation wizard starts.

3. When generating the UML model, the attribute will be converted to a member of the WINDEV or WEBDEV class. Its characteristics will become the characteristics of the member according to the following table: 
	

| UML class | WINDEV class |
| --- | --- |
| Attribute name | Member name |
| Caption of the attribute | Comment in the member declaration |
| Type of the attribute | Type of information in the member |
| Initial value of the attribute | Initial value of the member |
| Visibility of the attribute | Visibility of the member |






**4.** Validate the description of the attribute. The attribute is automatically added to the current class.

**Remark**: The characteristics of an attribute can be modified in the class description window (select "Description" in the context menu of the class).
<a name="NOTE2_4"></a>


### Add an operation
<a name="add_operation_ELTPARAGRAPHE000147"></a>

To add an operation: 

1. Select the class in which the operation is be added.

2. On the "Class diagram" tab, in the "Creation" group, click "Operation". The operation creation wizard starts.

3. When generating the UML model, the operation will become a method of the WINDEV class. Its characteristics will become the characteristics of the method according to the following table:
	

| UML class | WINDEV class |
| --- | --- |
| Name of the operation | Method name |
| Caption of the operation | Comment in the declaration of methods |
| Type of result returned (if the operation returns a result) | Type of result returned (if the method returns a result) |
| Parameters of the operation | Parameters of the method |
| Visibility of the operation | Visibility of the method |






**4.** Specify the type of the operation: abstract or shared between all the classes.
**5.** Validate the description of the operation. The operation is automatically added to the current class.

**Remark**: The characteristics of an operation can be modified in the class description window (select "Description" in the context menu of the class).

### Create a relationship
<a name="create_relationship_ELTPARAGRAPHE000202"></a>

To create a relationship: 

1. Depending on the type of relationship to create, on the "Class diagram" tab, in the "Creation" group:

	- click "Generalization" to create a generalization.

	- click "Association" to create an association.

	- click "Dependency" to create a dependency.




2. Specify the requested information.

3. Validate the description of the relationship.



<a name="NOTE2_6"></a>


### Creating a package
<a name="creating_package_ELTPARAGRAPHE000225"></a>

To create a package: 

1. On the "Class diagram" tab, in the "Creation" group, click "Package". A new package appears in the UML model.

2. Right-click the new package and select "Description" in the context menu. The package description window opens.

3. Specify:

	- the name of the package. This name is displayed in the package in the UML editor.

	- the caption describing the purpose of the package.




4. Validate the description of the package.



<a name="NOTE2_7"></a>


### Using packages
<a name="using_packages_ELTPARAGRAPHE000252"></a>

You can add classes to a package from the "UML analysis" pane. To do so, drag the class and drop it onto the desired package.

Remark: The classes that have been added to the packages are not displayed in the UML editor.
