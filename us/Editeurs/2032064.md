A query is not necessarily attached to a project. However, a query must be included in a project in order to be called from a process of the project.

On the contrary, a query is necessarily attached to a WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile analysis. A query can handle the data coming from an analysis other than the creation analysis. In this case, the structure of the files and items used by the query must be identical.

The WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile analysis contains the description of the files that will be interrogated by the query.

If the analysis is modified, an automatic synchronization is performed between the analysis and the queries.

When creating the query:

- if a project associated with an analysis is opened, the query will be automatically attached to the analysis of the project.

- if no project is opened, the analysis used must be specified in the wizard for query creation.
