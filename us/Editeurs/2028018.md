## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000197"></a>
The automatic data file modification updates the description of data files on user computers.

For more details, see [Automatic data file modification](../WDLang4/3044195.md).

## Configuring the automatic data file modification in WDInst
<a name="configuring_the_automatic_data_file_modification_wdinst_ELTTEXTE000221"></a>
The automatic data file modification must be configured:

- in the setup options ("Setup settings .. HFSQL files").

- in the description of each ".EXE" file that uses data files to be modified ("File description" window), 




To discover the different elements in the WDInst UI, see [WDInst interface](../Editeurs/2028022.md)

The following paragraphs present the automatic modification in the following cases:

- the automatic modification of HFSQL Classic data files.

- the automatic modification of Hyper File 5.5 data files or the migration from Hyper File 5.5 to HFSQL Classic.

### Running the automatic modification of WINDEV data files
<a name="running_the_automatic_modification_windev_data_files_ELTPARAGRAPHE000042"></a>

To run the automatic modification of WINDEV data files:

1. Select "Setup settings .. HFSQL files".

2. Check "Run the automatic data modification". 

3. Specify the operating mode of the automatic data modification:

	- "Automatic data modification without GUI" enables the automatic data modification without allowing any action from the user. 
			This option is available by default when the application's setup program is configured via the wizard. 

	- the option "Ask for confirmation before running the automatic data modification" is used to display the list of modified data files and to ask the end user for confirmation. 

	- the option "Display the advanced options of the automatic data modification" is used to display a specific window to the end user (see [Updating with automatic data file modification](#NOTE3_1)). 




4. Specify (if necessary) the password associated with the analysis. 

5. Validate the window for setup options. 

6. In the "List of setup files" window, select the executable file (".EXE") on which the automatic data file modification must be performed. In the "HFSQL" tab, check "Manage automatic data modification". 

7. Click the "Advanced" button.

8. Select (if necessary) the analysis in WINDEV format (".WDD" file) associated with the application.

9. For each data file of the analysis, specify (if necessary) the password of the data file (if it exists). 
	To change this password, select "Change password" and enter the new password.


**Remark**: Repeat these steps to run the automatic modification on data files used by several ".EXE" files.

### Running the automatic modification of Hyper File 5.5 data files or migrating from Hyper File 5.5 to HFSQL Classic
<a name="running_the_automatic_modification_hyper_file_55_data_files_migrating_from_hyper_file_55_hfsql_classic_ELTPARAGRAPHE000080"></a>

To run the automatic modification of Hyper File 5.5 data files or to migrate Hyper File 5.5 data files to HFSQL Classic, follow the same steps. 

In the "List of setup files" window: 

1. Select the executable (".EXE") file on which automatic data file modification should be run.

2. In the "HFSQL" tab: 

	- Check "Manage the automatic data modification".

	- Check "Manage Hyper File 5.5 files".

	- Click the "Advanced" button.




3. Select the analysis in HFSQL Classic format (".WDD" file) associated with the application.

4. For each data file of analysis, specify if necessary:

	- the password of the data file (if it exists) in the analysis in WINDEV format.
			Remark: To change this password, select "Change password" and enter the new password.

	- if the application uses a migrated WINDEV 5.5 analysis:

		- the source analysis in WINDEV 5.5 format (".WDA" file).

		- the name of the data file in the analysis in WINDEV 5.5 format.

		- the password of the data file (if it exists) in the analysis in WINDEV 5.5 format.







**Remark**: Repeat these steps to run the automatic modification on data files used by several ".EXE" files.

## Updating an application with automatic data file modification
<a name="updating_application_with_automatic_data_file_modification_ELTTEXTE000263"></a>
When installing an update with automatic data file modification, you can give the user the ability to configure this automatic modification: an "Advanced options" button is then displayed in the setup program. The following window is displayed: 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Param%E9trer_modif_auto_des_fichiers%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif&type=thumb)
This window is used to:

- create a report of the operations performed by the automatic data modification. If a problem occurs, this file can be given to the application manager. 
	By default, this file is named "LOGMODAUTO.TXT" and it is created in the setup directory of the application.

- list the HFSQL data files on which the automatic modification will be performed. You will have the ability to add to this list:

	- additional data files.

	- additional directories containing data files.




- specify additional directories containing data files in Hyper File 5.5 format that are not automatically found during the update.




**Remark**: During the update, the data files automatically found are:

- the files found in the setup directory of the application.

- the files listed in the ".REP" file. For more details, see the help about the [management of .REP files](../WDLang4/3044186.md).




To prevent the user from accessing the options used to configure the automatic modification, the setup editor WDInst allows you to make the "Advanced" button invisible in the setup program.

### Making the "Advanced" button invisible
<a name="making_the_advanced_button_invisible_ELTPARAGRAPHE000141"></a>

To make the "Advanced" button invisible:

1. Select "Setup settings .. HFSQL files".

2. Check "Automatic data modification without GUI".
