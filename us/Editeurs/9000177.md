## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000177"></a>
The first project window corresponds to the first window that will be opened when starting the WINDEV or WINDEV Mobile application. 

This window is also the first window that will be opened during the project test on the development computer.

## How to define the first project window?
<a name="how_define_the_first_project_window_ELTTEXTE000201"></a>
WINDEV proposes several methods for defining and choosing the first project window:

- [Via the "Project explorer" pane](#NOTE2_2).

- [In the configuration description](#NOTE2_3).

- [During the first project test](#NOTE2_4). 




**Remark**: The first project window is also requested during the project test, if no window was defined. For more details, see [Test a project](../Editeurs/2019003.md).
