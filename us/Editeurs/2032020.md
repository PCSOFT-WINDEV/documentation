## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000092"></a>
The query editor allows you to perform operations on the values of an item. The possible operations are:

- the sum of item values.

- the mean of item values.

- the calculation of the minimum value for all the item values.

- the calculation of the maximum value for all the item values.

## Scope of operations
<a name="scope_operations_ELTTEXTE000116"></a>
These operations are performed:

- on **all the records** selected by the query.

- on **sub-sets of records** (automatically grouped by the query).




For example, you want to find out:

- the total amount of orders placed by the customers living in Seattle.

- the order with the smallest amount.

- the average sum spent by the customer named Darwin.

- ...

## When to define the operations?
<a name="when_define_the_operations_ELTTEXTE000140"></a>
The operations are defined when creating the query. However, you have the ability to add, modify or delete the operations performed in a query. For more details, see [Operations in a query: add and delete](../Editeurs/2032015.md).

**Caution**: If the query result is displayed in a report, the operations to perform on the item values must be defined during report description.
