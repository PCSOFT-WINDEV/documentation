## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000207"></a>
The groupware in automatic mode offers several possibilities. If you want to configure the management of users and rights in a more precise way, WEBDEV propose 2 customization levels:

- **Simple customization**: Simple customization can be activated: 

	- either by choosing "Manual launch by a template of control " ("General" tab) and/or "Customize the connection UI " ("Options" tab). 

	- or by choosing "Launch automatic ("General" tab) and "Customize the connection UI " ("Options" tab).


 In this case, only login and registration information can be personalized.. The project will benefit from all the latest developments in Groupware.   

- **Advanced customization** , activated by choosing the option "Full customization (expert mode)". 
	In this case, all user groupware components can be customized..

## Easy-to-customize user groupware
<a name="easytocustomize_user_groupware_ELTTEXTE000231"></a>


### Implementation 
<a name="implementation_ELTPARAGRAPHE000027"></a>

To set up the user groupware with simple customization, simply: 

1. On the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, click "User Groupware". 

2. In the description window of the current project configuration, in "User Groupware: Disabled", click "Change". 

3. In the window that appears, enable the User Groupware. 

4. In the "General" tab, select the option "Manual launch by a field template".. 
	Remark: You can also keep the automatic launch and select the option "Customize the UI connection (login, registration)".. 

5. Validate. The User Groupware is integrated into your project. 

6. An administrator account will be created during the first execution of application or site under the "supervisor" name. Then, the corresponding password can be specified.

### The integrated elements
<a name="the_integrated_elements_ELTPARAGRAPHE000055"></a>

An internal Component "WDGPU_WB_CNX" is automatically integrated into the project.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=GPU_Personnaliser_WB_Connexion%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)


This internal component contains all the elements used by the groupware to customize the connection:

- various pages, 

- page templates, 

- a control template, 

- a set of procedures proposing several useful functions. 




This internal component contains a control template ("TPLC_GPU_Connection") that is used to manage the connection. To add this control template, simply drag and drop it onto the desired pages (or templates). 

Once it has been added, you can customize it: 

- by overloading the controls and/or the processes for small modifications, 

- by directly modifying the control template for more important changes.

### Use example
<a name="use_example_ELTPARAGRAPHE000077"></a>

An AWP site proposes a public section and a private section. To access the private section, the Web user must identify himself. 

In the menu, a "Specific access" option is used to display the authentication page. 

The "TPLC_GPU_Connection" control template was included in the menu to manage the user authentication.

## User groupware with advanced customization
<a name="user_groupware_with_advanced_customization_ELTTEXTE000267"></a>


### Implementation 
<a name="implementation_ELTPARAGRAPHE000090"></a>

To set up the user groupware with advanced customization, simply: 

1. On the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, click "User Groupware". 

2. In the description window of the current project configuration, in "User Groupware: Disabled", click "Change". 

3. In the window that appears, enable the User Groupware.

4. In the "Options" tab, select "Full customization (expert mode)".. 




**Caution**: As soon as the User Groupware is customized in a project, the project will no longer benefit from the evolutions made to the User Groupware. Therefore, it is recommended to switch to "custom" mode with great care and only if you want to make important modifications. Otherwise, it is recommended to use the User Groupware in automatic mode. To retrieve the evolutions made to the groupware, see "Evolutions". 

Remark: the user groupware with advanced customization can be used at the same time as an template of fields for connection..

### The integrated elements
<a name="the_integrated_elements_ELTPARAGRAPHE000118"></a>

When a project uses the custom User Groupware, an internal component called "WDGPU_WB" is automatically included in the project.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=GPU_Personnaliser_WB_Complet%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)


This internal component contains all the elements used by the groupware:

- the groupware pages, for the classic mode and for the AWP mode, 

- the groupware analysis, 

- the queries,

- two sets of procedures proposing several useful functions, 

- a class for context management.


All these elements can be modified: you have the ability to add an item into the "GPU_User" file or to implement checks on some controls for example.

### Retrieving the evolutions made to the User Groupware
<a name="retrieving_the_evolutions_made_the_user_groupware_ELTPARAGRAPHE000136"></a>

If you customize the User Groupware, a solution allows you to retrieve the different evolutions made to the User Groupware: perform a comparison between your project that includes your modifications and the same project that includes an internal component without modification.

To do so:

1. Create a copy of your project.

2. In the "copy" project, delete the internal component named "WDGPU_WB".

3. Then, ask to check this component back in via the window for configuring the groupware (open and re-validate the window to force the integration of the internal component).

4. Compare the projects: on the "Project" tab, in the "Other actions" group, expand "Compare" and select "Compare two projects...". Ask to compare the current project and the "copy" project.

5. The "Management/Resolution of differences" window allows you to see all the differences between the elements from your modified internal component and the ones from the "standard" internal component.




You can then easily retrieve the evolutions of the "standard" internal component you are interested in.
