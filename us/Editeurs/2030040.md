## Overview

An **application** is a set of objects (windows, controls, ...) organized in a specific purpose (monitor the sales of products for example). The user uses an application by starting an "Executable" file ("MonitorSales.exe" for instance).

WINDEV enables you to create an application via the **project**.

A project is a logical set of objects and processes whose purpose is to accomplish a given objective. The project manages:

- the relationships between the objects.

- the relationships between the objects and the data files (described in the analysis linked to the project).




A project can be linked to a single analysis.

The same analysis can be associated with several projects.
