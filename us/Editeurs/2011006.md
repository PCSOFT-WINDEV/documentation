## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000216"></a>
The main operations that can be performed on an LDM are as follows:

- [Duplicate/Copy an LDM](#NOTE2_1).

- [Delete an LDM](#NOTE2_2).

- [Rename an LDM](#NOTE2_3).

- [Associate an LDM with a project](#NOTE2_4).

- [Enlarge or reduce the LDM display](#NOTE2_5).

- [Move the LDM display](#NOTE2_6).




**Remark**: The "LDM" and "Analysis" terms are indifferently used to define the structure of database associated with a project.

### Duplicate/Copy an LDM
<a name="duplicatecopy_ldm_ELTPARAGRAPHE000039"></a>

Duplicating an LDM allows you to have two identical LDMs with different names.

To duplicate/copy an LDM:

1. Open the analysis to duplicate in the data model editor.

2. On the "Home" tab, in the "General" group, expand "Save" and select "Save as". The analysis description is displayed.

3. Modify the analysis name and directory.

4. Validate the modifications:

	- All files used to describe the duplicated analysis are automatically copied into the specified directory.

	- The duplicated analysis is automatically associated with the current project.







**Remark**: The backup subdirectories of the source analysis are not copied. The new analysis contains no backup.

### Delete an LDM
<a name="delete_ldm_ELTPARAGRAPHE000070"></a>

To delete an LDM:

1. Open the Windows explorer.

2. Delete the full directory of the analysis (&lt;Project name&gt;.ANA directory).




**Remark**: If this analysis was used by a project, this project must be associated with another analysis when it is opened.

### Rename an LDM
<a name="rename_ldm_ELTPARAGRAPHE000082"></a>

To rename an LDM:

1. Open the LDM to rename in the data model editor.

2. On the "Home" tab, in the "General" group, expand "Save" and select "Save as". The analysis description is displayed.

3. Enter the new name for the LDM.

4. Validate the modification.

5. All files used to describe the renamed analysis are automatically copied into the specified directory.

6. The renamed analysis is not automatically associated with the current project. Associate (if necessary) the renamed analysis with the current project. For more details, see 'Associating an LDM with an existing project'.

7. In the Windows explorer, delete (if necessary) the directory of source analysis.

### Associating an LDM with an existing project
<a name="associating_ldm_with_existing_project_ELTPARAGRAPHE000109"></a>

To associate an LDM with an existing project:

1. Open the project to associate.

2. On the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, click "Description". The project description opens.

3. In the "Analysis" tab, specify the name and path of the LDM that must be associated with the project. .




**Remark**: If data of the source analysis is handled in the project, associating a new analysis can trigger errors (duplicate error, display error, ...).

### Zoom factor
<a name="zoom_factor_ELTPARAGRAPHE000134"></a>

A zoom factor can be specified to reduce or enlarge the display of the current LDM.

To specify a zoom factor:

- **1st method**:

	- On the "Display" tab, in the "Help for edit" group, choose the desired zoom factor.

	- Enter the zoom factor in the status bar of the editor (bottom right).

To move the display of an LDM:

1. Open the LDM in the data model editor.

2. Press the Alt key.

3. Modify the position of the LDM while keeping both the left mouse button and the Alt key down.
