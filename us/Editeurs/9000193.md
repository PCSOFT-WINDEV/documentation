## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000149"></a>
All developers appreciate the possibility to debug an application directly on the device.

Sometimes it is necessary to trace a feature that cannot be effectively emulated on a PC: GPS location, embedded printer, scanner, access to phone contacts and calendar, photo and video recording, gestures (delete rows by swiping, etc.)...

From version 25, WINDEV Mobile allows you to debug an under-development Android application directly on the device.

The principle is very simple: When the project is executed in "Debug on mobile device" mode, the Android application is generated with a specific name (GO &lt;Project name&gt;) and executed on the Android device connected to the development computer. You can add breakpoints in the WLanguage code. As soon as a breakpoint is encountered, the debugger will automatically be launched on the development computer.

### Debugging a project in Android
<a name="debugging_project_android_ELTPARAGRAPHE000022"></a>

To debug a project in Android: 

1. Test the project via the quick access buttons: 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=MP%20-%20Go%20test%20Android%20-%20HC%20N%B0001%202.gif)


2. If the application has never been generated, a warning message proposes to launch the Android application generation wizard. 
	Remark: the generation wizard can also be launched if important changes have been made in the application (addition of a Map control, etc.). 

3. The application is generated and launched on the Android device connected to the development computer in "Debugger" mode. 

4. The code editor is displayed in debugger mode on the development computer. 




Remarks: 

- Stopping the debugging on the development computer does not close the application on the Android device. 

- The debugger is not available on an emulator. 

- The device must allow USB debugging. For more details, see [Preparing the phone to test an Android application](../Editeurs/9000117.md). 

- The [Android Control Center](../CCAndroid/1410086630.md) allows you to see the traces and debug information of the application being tested.

### InTestMode function
<a name="intestmode_function_ELTPARAGRAPHE000055"></a>

[InTestMode](../WDLang1/3013011.md) returns <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> in the following cases: 

- If the project is tested on the device from WINDEV Mobile. 

- If the &lt;Project name&gt;.go application is launched on the Android device. 



<a name="NOTE3_2"></a>


### Add the debug application generated to your Firebase console
<a name="add_the_debug_application_generated_your_firebase_console_ELTPARAGRAPHE000071"></a>

The new debug application package generated by WINDEV Mobile has the same name as the original application package with the ".go" extension. For example, if the name of your application package is "com.wmsport.android", the name of the debug application package will be "com.wmsport.android.go".

If you use Google services that require enabling Firebase in your application (such as push notifications): 

- Also add the debug application to the Firebase console (for more details, see [Push notification: Android configuration (Firebase)](../WDLang3/1000022215.md)).

- Download the new google-services.json file including both applications, in order to provide it instead of the previous one.

### Unavailable features
<a name="unavailable_features_ELTPARAGRAPHE000086"></a>

Some features of the debugger are not available in this version: 

- F8 to change processes or events. 

- Run to cursor.

- Set next statement. 

- Particular breakpoint modes (ignore intermediate breakpoints, ignore timers, etc.).

- Automatic evaluations (current line of code identifiers, return values, local and global variables, members of the current class (this), HFSQL (Out, Error, etc.), WLanguage (Error, etc.)).

- HFSQL information (data files, queries, etc.).

- System information (critical sections, semaphores, etc.).

- Save the results of a query.

- Fix and continue.

- Audit, profiler, memory.

- Trace, error, exception.

- Breakpoints in internal procedures. 

- Display values of non-simple variables (structures, xml, json, arrays, etc.)
