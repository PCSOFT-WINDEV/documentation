The original example can be kept unchanged. Every time you open the example (via the "Open an example" option), you can work on the copy or on the original version.

**Remarks**: 

- If the tutorial is not installed, you can download the examples from a PC SOFT server.

- When you open an exercise from the tutorial, a copy is automatically made in "My Projects\\My Examples".  The opened project corresponds to the copy. This allows you to work or make changes to this copy. Therefore, the initial project is preserved. Each time the exercise is opened via "Tutorial", you can work on the modified exercise or on the original exercise.
