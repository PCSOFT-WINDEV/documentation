## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000182"></a>
The SCM gives you the ability to define a check-in policy. Simply define the criteria that must be matched in order for a project element to be checked back in into the repository. Among the possible criteria:

- No compilation error, 

- Run at least one test of the element, ...




These rules can be mandatory or not. If a rule is not complied with, the developer may be required to provide an explanation.

## How to?

### Defining a check-in policy
<a name="defining_checkin_policy_ELTPARAGRAPHE000023"></a>

To define a check-in policy: 

1. On the "SCM" tab, in the "Repository" group, expand "Manage" and select "Check-in policy".<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=GDS_Politique.gif)


2. Select the conditions the checked-in elements must meet. These rules are grouped in three tabs: "General", "Automated tests" and "Code metrics". 

3. Specify the options of the check-in policy:

	- Always ignore the rules on the project (wdp): Used to ignore the rules when handling the project file (wdp file).

	- Ability to ignore the rules.

	- Required comment if a condition isn't met.




4. Validate. The check-in policy is automatically taken into account for the current project.




**Remark**: The check-in policy can also be defined from the SCM administrator ("Check-in policy" from the popup menu of a project).

### How the check-in policy works
<a name="how_the_checkin_policy_works_ELTPARAGRAPHE000056"></a>

If the checked-in element does not comply with the check-in policy defined for the project, the following window appears:<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=GDS_NonRespect.gif)
 This window lists the criteria that are not met by the checked-in element.

If users are allowed to ignore the rules, they can check "Check in anyway".

If a comment is required, the validation button in this window will be ungrayed only when the comment is entered in the corresponding field.

The "Edit the policy" button allows you to edit and modify (if necessary) the rules defined for the check-in policy.

### Storing and handling the check-in policy
<a name="storing_and_handling_the_checkin_policy_ELTPARAGRAPHE000075"></a>

The check-in policy is stored in the "CheckInPolicy.scm" file found at the root of the project directory. This file is located in the SCM as all the project files. This file can be shared among several projects.

Specific rights can be assigned to the file corresponding to the check-in policy (to allow the project manager to modify this file for example).

If the "CheckInPolicy.scm" file is found in the parent directory, all the newly created projects will use this check-in policy.

Tip: For a branch, you have the ability to define a more restrictive check-in policy.

- No compilation information: To be checked in, the element must include no compilation information.

- No programming standard errors: To be checked in, the element must include no programming standard errors. This programming standard is defined in the "Compilation" tab of the project description window. For more details, see [Project description: Compilation tab](../Editeurs/9500218.md). 

- The checked-in element must be associated with a task or with an incident.

- A comment must be entered during the check-in operation.

<a name="automated_tests_tab_ELTPARAGRAPHE000110"></a>

The check-in rules proposed by the "Automated tests" tab are:

- Each element must include at least 1 automated test. Caution: if this option is selected, it applies to all the elements, even to the project file (".WDP") that contains the project initialization code.

- No automated test with errors.



<a name="NOTE3_3"></a>


### "Code metrics" tab
<a name="code_metrics_tab_ELTPARAGRAPHE000120"></a>

The "Code metrics" tab is used to enter the minimum percentage level to respect for code comments.
<a name="NOTE4_3"></a>


### "Action plan" tab
<a name="action_plan_tab_ELTPARAGRAPHE000127"></a>

In this tab, you can define the action plan to be executed when the project is checked in. If an action plan is to be executed, specify: 

- the software factory coordinator,

- the port of the coordinator,

- the user and the associated password. 


You can choose from the existing plans in the coordinator.
