## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000141"></a>
During the life of an application, items live and die. Before dying, they can become zombies.
Which means that the item still exists in the data description, that it can be used in the existing application code, but that the item must no longer be used when writing new code.
A zombie item takes space and therefore it should be deleted.
Zombie items are often found in the dead code.
In version 23, you have the ability to identify the zombie items in the analysis; they will be signaled when they are used.

To define a zombie file: 

1. In the data model editor, select the data file to use. 

2. Display the file description ("Description of data file" in the context menu). 

3. In the "Options" tab: 

	- Check "Obsolete or zombie file". 

	- Specify a comment if necessary. This comment will be displayed in the compilation error generated when using the zombie file.

4. Close the description window of data file. 

5. In the analysis graph, the zombie file is identified by the ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Fichier_zombie%20-%20HC%20N%B0002%201.gif)

## Handling a zombie file or item
<a name="handling_zombie_file_item_ELTTEXTE000195"></a>
In the different editors that handle data files and items (window editor, report editor, query editor, etc.), zombie files and items can be easily identified because they are grayed out and crossed out. 

Furthermore, a compilation error is used to easily identify the zombie elements used.
