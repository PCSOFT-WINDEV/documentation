## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000135"></a>
A window or page can display information coming from:

- a database: controls are directly bound to the items in the data files or queries available in the database.

- variables in the application's code (variables global to the window, page or project, class members, etc.).

- members or properties of .Net objects.

- .Net Object variables (to WLanguage arrays containing.Net Objects).




To display this information in a window or page, the controls in the window or page must be bound to:

- the different items in the database.

- the available WLanguage variables (Data binding).




There are multiple methods to display and update values from a data source:

- The binding between a control and an item or variable can be defined in the window or page editor, in the control description ("Binding" tab).

- [ScreenToFile](../WDLang4/3044146.md) (or [ScreenToSource](../WDLang4/1000017342.md)) updates the record or the variable with the data shown on the screen. 
	For the pages, you must use [PageToFile](../WDLang4/3044022.md) (or [PageToSource](../WDLang4/1000017406.md)).

- [FileToScreen](../WDLang4/3044210.md) (or [SourceToScreen](../WDLang4/1000017341.md)) updates the data displayed on the screen with the data from the record or variable. 
	For the pages, you must use [FileToPage](../WDLang4/3044148.md) (or [SourceToPage](../WDLang4/1000017405.md)).

## Remarks

- When dragging and dropping an item or variable onto a page or window, the corresponding control is automatically created with the corresponding binding.
	For more details on data binding, see [Data binding from the "Project explorer" pane](../Editeurs/2022050.md).

- Most types of controls can be bound to an item in a data file or variable. For more details on the types of controls, see the online documentation.

- Data binding on Table controls requires special management: Table controls based on variables are not handled as Table controls based on data files. For more details, see [Specific features of data binding on Table controls](../WDChamp/1013306.md).

- **Limitations**:

	- Two-dimensional WLanguage arrays cannot be used for data binding.

	- Associative arrays cannot be used for data binding.
