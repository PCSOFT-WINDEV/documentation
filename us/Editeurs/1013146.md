## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000186"></a>
WINDEV lets you use the spelling checker in the Edit controls and text columns of the Table controls of WINDEV applications.

This spell check can be performed on the user computer: 

- with the integrated spelling checker.

- with Word or OpenOffice 2.0 (or later). 




**To use the integrated spelling checker**: 

1. Configure (if necessary) the project to use the integrated spell checking: 

	- Open the project description window: on the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, click "Description". 

	- In the "Options" tab: 

		- Select the spelling checker "Integrated checker". 

		- Check "Automatically copy the dictionaries to the generation directory" to include the dictionaries with the executable. It is also possible to integrate the corresponding files into the application library.




- Validate. 

2. Load the different dictionaries needed via [DictionaryLoad](../WDLang1/1000022958.md). 
	Remark: The French and English dictionaries are automatically loaded. 

3. Apply spell checking on the different controls of the application (edit control, column of Table control):

	- check "Check spelling" in the "Details" tab of the control description window.

	- use the [CheckSpell](../Proprietes/2510153.md) property in the WLanguage code.

	- use the [ConfigureSpellCheck](../WDLang1/3025052.md) function in the WLanguage code.

	- Validate.

### Integrated spelling checker
<a name="integrated_spelling_checker_ELTPARAGRAPHE000117"></a>

If the integrated spelling checker is used, the spelling automatically performed in the edit control and table columns: the words not found in the integrated dictionary are automatically underlined in red. The popup menu of the underlined word allows you to select one of the proposed words, or add the word to the dictionary.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=FAA_Verifier_Orthographe_int%E9gr%E9%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)
The words that are added to the dictionary can be found in: "C:\\Users\\&lt;User&gt;\\AppData\\Roaming\\PC SOFT\\perso.dic". They can be edited and deleted if necessary.

Two spelling checkers can be proposed according to the word processor installed on the computer. 

**If the word processor is Word**, the Word spelling checker can be automatically started on the edit controls ("Spell check" in the context menu).<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=FAA_Ortho_Word.gif)
**Remark**: This option is proposed only if Word is installed on the current computer. 

**If the word processor is OpenOffice**, the spell checker is automatically performed in the edit controls and in the table columns: the words not found in the OpenOffice dictionary are automatically underlined in red. The popup menu of the underlined word allows you to select one of the proposed words, or add the word to the dictionary. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=FAA_Ortho_Office.gif)
**Remark**: This option is proposed only if OpenOffice and its dictionary are installed on the current computer. See the documentation about this software to install the dictionaries.
