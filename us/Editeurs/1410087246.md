## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000090"></a>
Applications created with WINDEV offer users many automatic features on the different windows or controls in the application. Many features can be accessed simply with a right click on the window or control in the application. 

To help your users discover these features, a specific toast appears once a month if no AAF has been used. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=FAA_decouverte%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)

### Implementation

The AAF reminder toast is implemented automatically. It is displayed under the following conditions: 

- Having a window with controls that propose AAFs. 

- Not having used AAFs in that window for one month. 





### Programming

You can force the toast or disable it programmatically.

To force the display of the toast, use [AAFExecute](../WDLang1/1000022099.md) with the *aafDiscoverAAF* constant. Example: 

```wl
AAFExecute(myWindow, aafDiscoverAAF)
```


To disable the toast, use [AAFDisable](../WDLang1/1000022018.md) with the *aafDiscoverAAF* constant. Example: 

```wl
AAFDisable(aafDiscoverAAF)
```
