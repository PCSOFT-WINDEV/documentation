## Overview

The "FishEye" effect is used to enlarge a section of editor graphs (analysis graph, UML graph, ....) when an area is hovered by the mouse cursor. Its action is equivalent to the one of a magnifier. For example:<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=FishEye.gif)
