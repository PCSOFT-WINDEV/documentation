## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000510"></a>
Running the project step by step allows you to start the debugger when starting the application. This solution allows you to monitor the application progress.

**How debugging works**: Debugging an application consists in:

- checking the operating mode of a process,

- understanding the operating mode of an existing program,

- checking the values of variables,

- checking the operating mode of special cases in an application.




The debugger is used to perform these operations. The debugger also allows you to debug the components used in an application. For more details, see [Debugging a component](../Editeurs/2014012.md).

Remark: WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile also provide you with multiple trace tools (trace window, information box, etc.). For more details, see [Debugging without debugger](../Editeurs/2019002.md).

## Debugger
<a name="debugger_ELTTEXTE000534"></a>
The debugger allows you to trace the WLanguage programs in order to help you improve these programs. 

The executed source code appears on the screen. The processes run are sorted in hierarchical order in the "Debugger" pane.

The different options of the debugger can be accessed: 

- via the "Debugger" tab of the ribbon. 

- via the "Debugger" pane. 

- via the context menu of the code being debugged.

## How to?
<a name="how_ELTTEXTE000558"></a>


### Starting the debugger
<a name="starting_the_debugger_ELTPARAGRAPHE000061"></a>

Several methods can be used to start the debugger:

- **At the beginning of project test**: on the "Project" tab, in the "Test mode" group, expand "Test mode" and select "Debug project". The debugger is started when the project is run.
	This method is recommended if you want to check the initialization processes of project and the initialization processes of first window or page.

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) **When interrupting the test by pressing Ctrl + Pause**. The action performed once the Ctrl + Pause keys have been pressed (click on a button, ...) will start the debugger.

- **During the test, by starting the debugger from the code editor**. This method is recommended to start the debugger when a process seems to take an unusual long time (endless loop for example). In this case, perform the following operations:

	- Click the WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile icon in the taskbar.

	- In "Do you want to stop the test?", select "No".

	- In the "Debugger" tab, click "Pause" ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=main_debog.gif)
. 




- **Through programming**, by adding the **[Stop](../Motscles/1511014.md)** keyword where the debugger must be started.
	 This method is recommended when the process from which the debugger must be started is known.
	**Remark**: The [Stop](../Motscles/1511014.md) keyword is only taken into account when testing the application in the WINDEV, WINDEV Mobile or WEBDEV editor. The [Stop](../Motscles/1511014.md) keyword is ignored when using the executable.

- **In the code editor** by adding a breakpoint into the code at the location from which the debugger will be started. For more details on breakpoints, see [Managing breakpoints](../Editeurs/2019005.md).

- **From an expression typed in the "Debugger" pane**. For more details, see [Expression to evaluate](#NOTE4_3).




Once the debugger is running: 

- the WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile code editor displays the "Debugger" tab. The text of the tab is shown in red.

- the status bar is shown in orange. 





### Remark: Minimizing (or not) the editor during the test
<a name="remark_minimizing_not_the_editor_during_the_test_ELTPARAGRAPHE000125"></a>

During a test, the editor is minimized by default. Depending on the hardware configuration (wide screen, 2 screens, etc.), you may not need to minimize the editor. 

To keep the editor opened: 

1. On the "Home" tab, in the "Environment" group, expand "Options" and select "Options of the code editor". 

2. In the "Debugger" tab, uncheck "Minimize editor in test mode". 

3. Validate. 



<a name="NOTE3_2"></a>


### Using the debugger in 32 and 64-bit
<a name="using_the_debugger_32_and_64bit_ELTPARAGRAPHE000155"></a>

The debugger is available in 32-bit and 64-bit versions. All the features are available in these two modes. 

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) **Tests in WINDEV**: 
In a WINDEV application, you have the ability to create project configurations for the 32-bit and 64-bit executables. If your computer is equipped with a 32-bit system, the debugger will be run in 32-bit mode. If your computer is equipped with a 64-bit system, the debugger will be run in 64 bit-mode. 

|   | 32-bit system | 64-bit system |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 32-bit Executable configuration | 32-bit GO | 32-bit GO |
| 64-bit Executable configuration | GO! (32-bit) | 64-bit GO |
| Component | 32-bit GO | 32-bit or 64-bit GO |


Remarks: 

- When running a 64-bit project configuration on a 32-bit system, an exclamation mark appears on the GO icon to indicate that the execution will be performed in 32-bit mode. 

- When running a component, the debugging mode of the element must be specified. This option can be specified via menu of the GO icon of the project ("Debug element in 64-bit").

### Running code in the debugger
<a name="running_code_the_debugger_ELTPARAGRAPHE000219"></a>

Once the debugger is enabled, each operation performed in the application positions the debugger cursor (represented by the arrow) on the code currently run. You can now continue to run the code:

- line by line,

- by block of lines,

- by ignoring the breakpoints,

- by modifying the code to run ("Edit and continue"),

- by indicating the code line to run (Backspace).






**1. Running code line by line**
To run the current line of code, use:

- The F7 key to run the code of the line and the code of the procedures called by this line. The execution of the line and the procedures it calls are displayed in the debugger. The icon that corresponds to this option in the "Debugger" pane is the following:  ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Partie2_PileDesAppels%205.gif)
.  

- The F8 key to run the code of the line and the code of the procedures called by this line. Only the execution of line will be viewed in the debugger. The icon that corresponds to this option in the "Debugger" pane is the following: ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Partie2_PileDesAppels%203.gif)





Remark: If the procedure has the &lt;without step by step&gt; extension attribute, its code will be ignored when debugging. For more details, see [Ignoring functions during step-by-step debugging](#NOTE4_6).

**2. Running code by block of lines**
By default, the debugger cursor (arrow) is positioned on the current line. The input mouse cursor (caret) can be positioned on any other line of code.
To run the lines of code found between the debugger cursor and the caret, press the F6 key. The icon that corresponds to this option in the "Debugger" pane is the following: ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Partie2_PileDesAppels%208.gif)


**3. Running code ignoring the breakpoints**
To run code ignoring breakpoints, click the ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Debug_IconeIgnorerpoint.gif)
 icon in the "Debugger" tab of the ribbon.
You can also 

- listing the breakpoints, 

- enable or disable a breakpoint, 

- add a breakpoint. 


**Remark**: To stop running the code in the debugger, click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Debug_IconeContinuerTest.gif)
. The project test continues without debugger.

**4. Editing the code to run**
To modify the code to run, modify the code in the project editor when running the test. A window indicates that a test is currently run and it asks whether the test must be stopped. Do not stop the test, make the desired change and resume the test.

**5. Running code while specifying the line of code to run (Backspace)**
You can indicate the line that must be run to the debugger. This line of code can be found before or after the line of code currently run. This feature is useful if the code to run was modified.
To do so, select "Define the next statement" in the debugger. This option is available in the "Debugger" tab of the ribbon and in the context menu of a line of code.

### Debugger stop mode
<a name="debugger_stop_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000288"></a>

The test (and debugger) stop mode can be configured in the options of the code editor: 

1. On the "Home" tab, in the "Environment" group, expand "Options" and select "Options of the code editor". 

2. Display the "Debugger" tab.

## Notes
<a name="notes_ELTTEXTE000606"></a>


### Hierarchy of events/processes
<a name="hierarchy_eventsprocesses_ELTPARAGRAPHE000314"></a>

The events/processes currently run in the debugger are organized hierarchically. This hierarchy is listed in the call stack in the "Debugger" pane. 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Partie2_PileDesAppels.gif&type=thumb)


For example, the "Initialization" event of the application starts a window that uses a procedure. When the procedure is debugged, you will have the ability to go back to the code editor:

- At the location where the procedure is called.

- At the location where the window is opened.




**Remark**: This feature does not stop the debugging process.
<a name="NOTE4_2"></a>


### Viewing the content of variables
<a name="viewing_the_content_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000329"></a>

The debugger enables you to analyze the value of the variables used in the current code. The values can be viewed:

- When a variable is hovered over by the mouse cursor.

- In the debugger:

	- The ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Debug_IconeVariableLocale.gif)
 icon is used to display local variables.

	- The ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Debug_IconeVariableGlobale.gif)
 icon is used to display global variables.

	- You can also view the content of the variables in hexadecimal format via the ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Partie2_PileDesAppels%2016.gif)
 button. 







**Watch window**
The content of variables can be displayed in a specific window: the watch window. To display this window, all you have to do is select "Edit value" in the context menu of variable in the "Debugger" pane. This window is used to view the content of simple variables as well as the content of structured variables: array, multiline RTF string, structured type of language, class, ...

This window is a non-modal window: you have the ability to open several watch windows on different variables at the same time. These windows can remain opened when debugging the application. These windows are updated for each statement run. 

This window also allows you to: 

- View the variable displayed in hexadecimal mode.

- Save the variable content on disk (interesting for an RTF, HTML or Image variable). 

- Display an image found in a variable or in a memo. 

- Add the content of an RTF or HTML variable in formatted format. 



<a name="NOTE4_3"></a>


### Expression to evaluate
<a name="expression_evaluate_ELTPARAGRAPHE000364"></a>

The debugger allows you to insert an expression to evaluate. This expression can be of any type: variable, function, operation on variables, ... The expression result is calculated and displayed.

This expression is used to perform a custom debugging. For example, you can watch the content of a variable while it is being used in the application.

***An expression can be self-stopping***: the debugger can start as soon as a condition is checked or when the value of a variable is modified.
For example, in a mailshot sent to 40 000 customers, a problem occurs on number 12345. To start the debugger as soon as the customer number is equal to 12345, simply define the following expression as self-stopping:


```wl
Customer.CustNum = 12345
```


**To insert an expression**:

1. Select "Add an expression" from the popup menu of the "Debugger" pane.

2. Type the new expression.

3. Press the Enter key to validate the creation of expression. The expression value will be automatically displayed in the "Value" column when debugging.




**To modify an expression:**

1. Select the expression to modify.

2. Select "Edit the expression" in the context menu of "Debugger" pane.

3. Modify expression.

4. Validate modifications by pressing the Enter key. The expression value will be automatically displayed in the "Value" column when debugging.




**To delete an expression:**

1. Select the expression to delete.

2. Select "Delete the expression" in the context menu of "Debugger" pane. The expression is deleted.




**To make an expression self-stopping:** simply check the "Stop" column in front of the desired expression.

### HFSQL status report and WLanguage status report
<a name="hfsql_status_report_and_wlanguage_status_report_ELTPARAGRAPHE000399"></a>

The HFSQL status report (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Debug_IconeCpteRenduHF.gif)
) shows the result of the following HFSQL functions (if they exist) in the "Debugger" pane:

- [HOut](../WDLang4/3044094.md),

- [HFound](../WDLang4/3044104.md),

- [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md),

- [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md),

- [HRecNum](../WDLang4/3044063.md).






The WLanguage status report (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Debug_IconeCpteRenduWL.gif)
) shows the following information in the "Debugger" pane:

- timer number (if it exists),

- number and message of non-fatal errors,

- name of the current object (corresponding to the [MySelf](../Motscles/1511007.md) keyword).



<a name="NOTE4_5"></a>


### Managing threads
<a name="managing_threads_ELTPARAGRAPHE000437"></a>

You have the ability to debug a multi-threaded application. When a breakpoint or a STOP statement is reached, you can:

- See the different threads.

- Switch to the information about the different threads (call stack, variables, ...) via the combo box found in the "Debugger" pane.  



![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Debog_thread.gif)

<a name="NOTE4_6"></a>


### Ignore certain functions when debugging in "Step by step" mode
<a name="ignore_certain_functions_when_debugging_step_step_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000449"></a>

During step-by-step debugging, it is sometimes necessary not to debug the content of some functions (e.g. a log function or a conversion function). 

To do so, the declaration of the function, procedure or method must be followed by the **&lt;no step into&gt;** extension attribute. 

For more details, see: 

- [Declaring a procedure/a function](../Motscles/1513008.md).

- [Classes, members, methods and properties](../POO/6010006.md)
