You are trying to declare a constant in a process where this type of declaration is not allowed.

**Reminder**: The constants must be declared in:

- The initialization code of the project in order to be used in all the processes of the project (code of project, code of windows and code of controls).

- The opening code of a window or page in order to be used in all the processes of the window or page (codes of window/page and codes of the controls found in the window/page).




<a name="NOTE2"></a>
<a name="NOTE2_1"></a>


## Correction
<a name="correction_ELTTEXTE000117"></a>
Declare your constant in the appropriate code.

<a name="NOTE3"></a>
<a name="NOTE3_1"></a>


## Example
<a name="example_ELTTEXTE000141"></a>


### A constant is declared in the click code of a button found in the "WIN_Menu" window
<a name="constant_declared_the_click_code_button_found_the_winmenu_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000030"></a>

**Code triggering the error** 


```wl
// -- Click code of BTN_DISPLAY
Constant 
	VATRate = 22.6
END
```


**Possible corrections**
Declare the constant in the opening code of the window.


```wl
// -- Opening code of WIN_Menu
Constant
	VATRate = 22.6
END
```


Declare the constant in the declaration code of the global variables of the page.


```wl
// -- Declaration code of global variables of PAGE_Menu
Constant 
	VATRate = 22.6
END
```
