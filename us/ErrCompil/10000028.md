## Reason
<a name="reason_ELTTEXTE000097"></a>
You are using a conditional statement (SWITCH). The END keyword must be used to end this statement.

## Examples

### Using a conditional statement without END
<a name="using_conditional_statement_without_end_ELTPARAGRAPHE000025"></a>

**Code triggering the error**


```wl
SWITCH EDT_Quantity 
	CASE 1: STC_Comment = "Benefit from our promotions: buy one, get one free"
	CASE 2: STC_Comment = "Buy one product, get one free"
```


**Possible correction**

Use the END keyword to specify that the conditional condition is ended.


```wl
SWITCH EDT_Quantity 
	CASE 1: STC_Comment = "Benefit from our promotions: buy one, get one free"
	CASE 2: STC_Comment = "Buy one product, get one free"
END
```

<a name="NOTE3_2"></a>


### Nested conditional statements
<a name="nested_conditional_statements_ELTPARAGRAPHE000040"></a>

**Code triggering the error**


```wl
SWITCH EDT_Quantity 
	CASE 1: STC_Comment = "Benefit from our promotions: buy one, get one free"
	CASE 2: STC_Comment = "Buy one product, get one free"
	IF EDT_Quantity > 5 THEN
		STC_Comment = ""
END
```


**Possible correction**

Check whether all the nested statements are properly ended (with the END statement for example). In our example, the second IF statement has no associated END. Add an END statement.


```wl
SWITCH EDT_Quantity 
	CASE 1: STC_Comment = "Benefit from our promotions: buy one, get one free"
	CASE 2: STC_Comment = "Buy one product, get one free"
	IF EDT_Quantity > 5 THEN
		STC_Comment = ""
	END
END
```
