<a name="NOTE1"></a>
<a name="NOTE1_1"></a>


## Reason
<a name="reason_ELTTEXTE000086"></a>
You are trying to access a non-global class member from a global method.

**Reminder**: The global members can be handled from a global method only (the non-global members cannot be handled).

<a name="NOTE2"></a>
<a name="NOTE2_1"></a>


## Correction
<a name="correction_ELTTEXTE000110"></a>
Two possibilities:

- Transform the member into global member

- Handle a global member




<a name="NOTE3"></a>
<a name="NOTE3_1"></a>

### Handling a non-global member in a global method
<a name="handling_nonglobal_member_global_method_ELTPARAGRAPHE000030"></a>

**Code triggering the error** 


```wl
GLOBAL PROCEDURE Drawing::Destroy()
// Frees a list of drawings
pDrawing, pAux are objects Drawing dynamic
// Free the object from the last one
pDrawing=::pLast
WHILE pDrawing<>NULL
	// Store the current drawing
	pAux=pDrawing
	// Move forward in the linking
	pDrawing=pDrawing:pPrevious
	// Free the current drawing
	Delete pAux
END
::pLast = NULL
```




**Possible correction**

Define the pLast member as being a global member.
