## Reason
<a name="reason_ELTTEXTE000068"></a>
You are trying to access a method from a class that is derived by a private inheritance. This method cannot be accessed from a code external to this class or from a code of a class derived from this derived class.

<a name="NOTE2_1"></a>


## Correction
<a name="correction_ELTTEXTE000092"></a>
Two possibilities: 

- Access this method from a method of the derived class. 

- Transform the protected inheritance to public inheritance: the method will be accessible from the code of the derived classes as well as from a code external to the class.
