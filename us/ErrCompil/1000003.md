<a name="NOTE1"></a>
<a name="NOTE1_1"></a>


## Reason
<a name="reason_ELTTEXTE000118"></a>
This line of code contains quotes to delimit a character string. These quotes have been "opened" but they have not been closed before the end of the code line.

**Reminder**: In the code editor, going to the next line (with the ENTER key) is considered as being a separator of statements.

To specify that the current code line continues over the next line, "..." must be used at the end of the line.

<a name="NOTE2"></a>
<a name="NOTE2_1"></a>


## Correction
<a name="correction_ELTTEXTE000142"></a>
Check your code line and end the string with quotes.

**Remark**: The syntactic coloring helps you see the end of the character string.
