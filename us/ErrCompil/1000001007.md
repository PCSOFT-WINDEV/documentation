<a name="NOTE1"></a>
<a name="NOTE1_1"></a>


## Reason
<a name="reason_ELTTEXTE000091"></a>
You are trying to access a global member of the class by using the syntax allowing you to access a non-global member.

You are using the following syntax:

```txt
ClassName:MemberName
```


This syntax cannot be used to access a global member.

<a name="NOTE2"></a>
<a name="NOTE2_1"></a>


## Correction
<a name="correction_ELTTEXTE000115"></a>
Use the proper syntax for accessing a global member of the class: 

```txt
ClassName::MemberName
```


<a name="NOTE3"></a>
<a name="NOTE3_1"></a>

```wl
Drawing::pLast
```
