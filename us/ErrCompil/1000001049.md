<a name="NOTE1"></a>
<a name="NOTE1_1"></a>


## Reason
<a name="reason_ELTTEXTE000085"></a>
You are trying to use some access directives (: PUBLIC, PRIVATE, PROTECTED) during the definition of a composite variable. 

The access to a member of a composite variable cannot be restricted: all the members of a composite variable are public.

<a name="NOTE2"></a>
<a name="NOTE2_1"></a>


## Correction
<a name="correction_ELTTEXTE000109"></a>
Delete the keyword corresponding to an access directive: PUBLIC, PRIVATE, PROTECTED.

<a name="NOTE3"></a>
<a name="NOTE3_1"></a>
