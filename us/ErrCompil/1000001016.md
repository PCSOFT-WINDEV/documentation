<a name="NOTE1"></a>
<a name="NOTE1_1"></a>


## Reason
<a name="reason_ELTTEXTE000075"></a>
You are trying to access a private method of the class from a code other than a method of this class.

**Reminder**: A private method can only be used from a method of the class or from a method of a class derived from this class.

<a name="NOTE2"></a>
<a name="NOTE2_1"></a>


## Correction
<a name="correction_ELTTEXTE000099"></a>
Two possibilities:

- Replace the private method by:

	- A **public** method: the access to the method will not be restricted.

	- A **protected** method: the access to this method will be performed from a derived class.




- Don't handle this private method from one of the project codes.
