## Reason
<a name="reason_ELTTEXTE000105"></a>
You are trying to use the ':' and '::' operators at the beginning of a code line that does not belong to a class process.

Reminder:

- The ':' character is used to access a member or a method of the instance of the current class or base class.

- The '::' characters are used to access a member, a method or a global constant of the current class or base class.

## Correction
<a name="correction_ELTTEXTE000129"></a>


- **To access a member or a method of a class instance** from a code that does not belong to this class (or to a derived class), the member or the method must be prefixed by the variable corresponding to the instance of the class.

- **To access a member, a method or a global constant of a class** from a code that does not belong to this class (or to a derived class), the member (the method or the constant) must be prefixed by the name of the class.
