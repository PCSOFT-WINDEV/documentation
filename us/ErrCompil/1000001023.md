<a name="NOTE1"></a>
<a name="NOTE1_1"></a>


## Reason
<a name="reason_ELTTEXTE000071"></a>
You are trying to access a member of a class previously derived by private inheritance. This member cannot be accessed from:

- A code external to the derived class (or external to its own derived classes).

- A code of the classes derived from the first class derived by a private inheritance.




<a name="NOTE2"></a>
<a name="NOTE2_1"></a>


## Correction
<a name="correction_ELTTEXTE000095"></a>
Two possibilities: 

- Access this member from a method of the derived class. 

- Transform the private inheritance to public inheritance: the member will be accessible from the code of the derived classes as well as from a code external to the class.
