<a name="NOTE1_1"></a>


## Reason
<a name="reason_ELTTEXTE000068"></a>
You try to access a base class of an inheritance. This class was derived by a protected inheritance: this class cannot be accessed from a code external to the class or from a code of one of its derived classes.

<a name="NOTE2_1"></a>


## Correction
<a name="correction_ELTTEXTE000092"></a>
Two possibilities: 

- Access the base class from a method of the derived class.

- Use a public inheritance: the class will be accessible from a code external to the class as well as from a code of its derived classes.
