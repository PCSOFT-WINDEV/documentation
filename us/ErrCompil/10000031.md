<a name="NOTE1"></a>
<a name="NOTE1_1"></a>


## Reason
<a name="reason_ELTTEXTE000090"></a>
This line of code uses the EXTERN keyword with a file name. The file is not found because:

- The name of the file is incorrect (spelling mistake in the file name for example).

- The path used to find the file is incorrect (the specified path does not exist for example).




**Reminder**: The EXTERN keyword is used to insert a file into the WLanguage code. By default, if no path is specified for the file, the file is sought in the project directory.

<a name="NOTE2"></a>
<a name="NOTE2_1"></a>


## Correction
<a name="correction_ELTTEXTE000114"></a>
Check the path and name of the file to include in the code.

**Remark**: The "Personal\\WLanguage" subdirectory of WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile can be used to store the files to include. In this case, the path is automatic: the file is automatically sought in this directory.

<a name="NOTE3"></a>
<a name="NOTE3_1"></a>


## Example
<a name="example_ELTTEXTE000138"></a>


### Using a file name that does not exist in the project directory
<a name="using_file_name_that_does_not_exist_the_project_directory_ELTPARAGRAPHE000032"></a>

**Code triggering the error** 


```wl
EXTERN "Constants.txt"
```




**Possible correction**

Create the file or modify the access path to the file.


```wl
EXTERN "C:\Constants\Constants.txt"
```
