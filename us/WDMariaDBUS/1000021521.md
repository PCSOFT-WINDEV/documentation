## Main remarks
<a name="main_remarks_ELTTEXTE000401"></a>




### Required versions
<a name="required_versions_ELTPARAGRAPHE000020"></a>Caution: This version of the Native MariaDB Connector works with:


- WINDEV 28 or WEBDEV 28.

- MariaDB client layer (libmariadb.DLL file)

	- 32-bit client layer to use the 32-bit Native MariaDB Connector (version 3.x.x to 10.x.x tested).

	- 64-bit client layer to use the 64-bit Native MariaDB Connector (version 10.x.x tested).




- The ***LibMariaDB.DLL*** DLL must be:

	- On the development computer: 

		- in the "\\Programs\\Framework\\Win32x86" directory of the setup directory of WINDEV or WEBDEV (32-bit).

		- in the "\\Programs\\Framework\\Win64x86" directory of the setup directory of WINDEV or WEBDEV (64-bit).




- On the deployment computer, in the executable directory or in the Windows directory. For a deployment on a Web server, the DLL must be found in the directory of the Native Connector or in the Windows directory.



<a name="NOTE2_2"></a>




### Using WLanguage commands in SQL queries
<a name="using_wlanguage_commands_sql_queries_ELTPARAGRAPHE000029"></a>

WLanguage commands cannot be used in SQL queries. 
<a name="NOTE2_3"></a>




### Limitations of MariaDB version 3.23x
<a name="limitations_mariadb_version_323x_ELTPARAGRAPHE000037"></a>

The MariaDB database version 3.23x does not support:

- the Partial Fetch. The use of Partial Fetch with the SQL functions of WLanguage has the same effect as if no Partial Fetch was used.

- the Unions.



<a name="NOTE2_4"></a>




### Managing large files
<a name="managing_large_files_ELTPARAGRAPHE000048"></a>

When handling large files, all the records are loaded in memory. To reduce memory usage, it is recommended to:

- use a filter ([HFilter](../WDLang4/3044100.md)) before initializing a browse ([HReadFirst](../WDLang4/3044051.md)/[HReadLast](../WDLang4/3044140.md), ...).

- use queries whose selection conditions are selective enough.

- avoid performing searches.



<a name="NOTE2_5"></a>




### INSERT queries and automatic identifier
<a name="insert_queries_and_automatic_identifier_ELTPARAGRAPHE000069"></a>

The automatic identifiers are not supported by the INSERT queries (created through programming or in the query editor). To use an automatic identifier, call [HAdd](../WDLang4/3044147.md) on the table.
<a name="NOTE2_6"></a>




### Creating a table with HCreation
<a name="creating_table_with_hcreation_ELTPARAGRAPHE000080"></a>

[HCreation](../WDLang4/3044255.md) creates "InnoDB" tables to support locks and transactions. For more details, see [Native MariaDB Connector: Specific features](../WDMySQL/5517005.md).
<a name="NOTE2_7"></a>




### Support for Unicode
<a name="support_for_unicode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000093"></a>

**When Unicode is supported on the connection (default mode),** the text items of the queries run with the *hQueryWithoutCorrection* constant are in Unicode format. If a Unicode string is assigned to an Ansi string, the conversion is automatically performed by WINDEV and WEBDEV by using the character set defined with [ChangeCharset](../WDLang1/3054001.md).

**If the connection is ANSI** ("WD Unicode Support = 0" in the extended information specified by [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md)), the text items of the queries run with the *hQueryWithoutCorrection* constant are in ANSI format.

For more details on Unicode or ANSI connections, see [Programming a MariaDB database with the HFSQL functions](../WDMariaDB/1000021528.md).
<a name="NOTE2_8"></a>


### Connection with SSL certificates
<a name="connection_with_ssl_certificates_ELTPARAGRAPHE000116"></a>

To establish a connection with SSL certificate, you must: 

1. Install a version of the MariaDB server that supports the SSL connections. For more details, see the MariaDB documentation.

2. Create the necessary certificates. 

3. Establish a connection by using the following keywords in the advanced information of the connection: 
	

| Keyword | Use |
| --- | --- |
| SSL Key | Path of key file. |
| SSL Cert | Path of certificate file. |
| SSL CA | Path of certification authority file. |
| SSL CAPath | Path of the directory containing the certificates of the recognized SLL certification authorities, in PEM format. |
| SSL Cipher | List of authorized ciphers. |






Example of SSL connection on the CRM database of the mariadbserver.domain.fr server: 

```wl
MyConnection is Connection

// Describe the connection
MyConnection.User = "root"
MyConnection.Password = "secret"
MyConnection.Server = "mariadbserver.domain.fr"
MyConnection.Database = "CRM"
MyConnection.Provider = hNativeAccessMariaDB
MyConnection.Access = hOReadWrite

// Describe the extended information for an SSL connection
MyConnection.ExtendedInfo = [
SSL KEY = E:\MySSLCertificates\mariadb.key;
SSL CERT = E:\MySSLCertificates\mariadb_cert.pem;
SSL CA = E:\MySSLCertificates\ca-cert.pem;
SSL CAPATH = E:\MySSLCertificates\CA\
]

// Open the connection
HOpenConnection(MyConnection)
```


**Remark**: These parameters correspond to the parameters of the mysql_ssl_set function of the C API for accessing MariaDB.

For more details, see [Optional connection information](../WDLang4/9000124.md).

## General requirements
<a name="general_requirements_ELTTEXTE000484"></a>




### Locking records
<a name="locking_records_ELTPARAGRAPHE000167"></a>

The lock options (*hLockWrite* and *hLockReadWrite* constants) that can be used with HFSQL functions are not supported in this version.

For more details, see [Native MariaDB Connector: Specific features](../WDMariaDB/1000021522.md).
<a name="NOTE3_2"></a>


### Identical records
<a name="identical_records_ELTPARAGRAPHE000179"></a>

The Native MariaDB Connector cannot differentiate between two identical records (which means with identical values for all items, excluding memo items).

When a record is modified or deleted, all the identical records will be modified or deleted.
<a name="NOTE3_3"></a>


### Transactions
<a name="transactions_ELTPARAGRAPHE000188"></a>

To manage the transactions, you must use a type of MariaDB table that supports the BEGIN, COMMIT and ROLLBACK commands.

For more details, see [Native MariaDB Connector: Specific features](../WDMariaDB/1000021522.md).
<a name="NOTE3_4"></a>


### SET or ENUM items
<a name="set_enum_items_ELTPARAGRAPHE000200"></a>

The SET and ENUM items are automatically processed and imported as text memo in WINDEV and WEBDEV. Indeed, the SET and ENUM items have no equivalence in HFSQL. They contain numeric values (indices) that correspond to "text" values. These are the "text" values that are imported.
<a name="NOTE3_5"></a>


### xBlob items
<a name="xblob_items_ELTPARAGRAPHE000207"></a>

The xBlob items in MariaDB are automatically processed and imported as text memo in WINDEV and WEBDEV:

- the BLOB items are imported as binary memo items.

- the LONGTEXT items are imported as text memo items.



<a name="NOTE3_6"></a>


### Array items
<a name="array_items_ELTPARAGRAPHE000217"></a>

The array items are not supported by the Native Connector. If you are using an array item, only the value of index 1 in the array will be handled by HFSQL functions (read/write).
<a name="NOTE3_7"></a>


### Using INSERT/UPDATE queries to insert text into a LONGBLOB item (binary memo) on MariaDB
<a name="using_insertupdate_queries_insert_text_into_longblob_item_binary_memo_mariadb_ELTPARAGRAPHE000224"></a>

To allow the management of Unicode items, the connections of Native MariaDB Connector are opened in UTF8: all the requests and the data are exchanged in UTF8 with the server.

The server converts the request and the values into the charset corresponding to each column, except for a **LONGBLOB** item (binary memo): in this case, the value is inserted as it is.

**For a LONGBLOB item**:

- if the connection is in ANSI format, the inserted text value is in ANSI format.

- if the connection is in UTF8 format, the inserted text value is in UTF8 format; in this case, a compatibility problem may occur.




To avoid this conversion problem in UTF8, you can:

- force the use of an ANSI connection by using the parameter: "WD Unicode Support = 0" of the extended connection information ([HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md)). For more details, see [Programming a MariaDB database with the HFSQL functions](../WDMariaDB/1000021528.md).

- change the type of the item from LONGBLOB to LONGTEXT on the MariaDB database.



<a name="NOTE3_8"></a>


### Partial indexing of memos and full-text indexing
<a name="partial_indexing_memos_and_fulltext_indexing_ELTPARAGRAPHE000252"></a>

The partial indexing of memos as well as the full-text indexing are not taken into account:

- when importing MariaDB tables into the analysis.

- when [HCreation](../WDLang4/3044255.md) is used.




If these features are defined in the analysis, they will be taken into account when running the SQL queries (with the *hQueryWithoutCorrection* constant) that use the SQL "CREATE TABLE" and "MATCH AGAINST" functions.

<a name="NOTE4"></a>
<a name="NOTE4_1"></a>


## Specific requirements for HFSQL and SQL functions
<a name="specific_requirements_for_hfsql_and_sql_functions_ELTTEXTE000550"></a>
The specific requirements for using HFSQL and SQL functions with the Native MariaDB Connector are as follows:

| Specific requirements | Affected functions |
| --- | --- |
| Multi-file query: <br>***HAdd***, ***HModify*** and ***HDelete*** are not supported. | [HAdd](../WDLang4/3044147.md)<br>[HModify](../WDLang4/3044042.md)<br>[HDelete](../WDLang4/3044018.md) |
| The searches performed on some complex queries with HReadSeek\* may fail in this version. <br>This problem will be fixed in a forthcoming version. | [HReadSeek](../WDLang4/3044050.md), [HReadSeekFirst](../WDLang4/3044036.md), [HReadSeekLast](../WDLang4/3044034.md) |
| When using Native MariaDB Connector, you must specify the "DataBase" used.<br>If you are using ***HConnect***, the "DataBase" must be specified in the additional information as follows:<br>"initial catalog = DataBaseName" | [HConnect](../WDLang4/3044263.md) |
| When creating tables with ***HCreation***, the table names must contain no accented character (example: "ÉlanFile").<br>This is a problem specific to MariaDB (checked on versions **3.23.52-max-nt** and **3.23.47-max-nt** of the MariaDB server). Running the SQL "DROP TABLE" command, performed by [HCreation](../WDLang4/3044255.md) to delete the table if it already exists, may cause an unexpected stop of the MariaDB server.<br>For more details, see [Native MariaDB Connector: Specific features](../WDMariaDB/1000021522.md). | [HCreation](../WDLang4/3044255.md) |
