The applications created with WINDEV can use several types of windows (and mix each one of these types).

### Modal windows
<a name="modal_windows_ELTPARAGRAPHE000017"></a>

A modal window is opened in the foreground of the application and it locks the access to the other windows that are already opened (if any). In most cases, modal windows are used as:

- main windows of an application,

- dialog boxes whose validation triggers an action.


With WINDEV, when a modal window is opened, a gray shadow appears on the windows displayed in the background: it is the DDW feature or Dim Disabled Windows.

### Non-modal windows

A non-modal window is opened in parallel with other application windows. Each window remains accessible. In most cases, non-modal windows are used:

- as tool palettes,

- as dialog boxes that affect the main window when modified.

In this example, each description window of a chair opens the description window of another chair. All open windows remain accessible.

### MDI windows

In an MDI application, all the application windows are displayed in the same main window: the MDI parent window. There are two types of windows in MDI applications:

| **MDI child window**: Application window displayed in the parent window. The user will be able to type information in these windows. |
