WINDEV allows you to create nine types of UML models:

- ***Class diagram***: describes the overall structure of a system.

- ***Use case diagram***: represents the system features from the user's point of view.

- ***Object diagram***: represents a set of objects and their relationships at a given time.

- ***Component diagram***: describes the physical and static architecture of a computer application.

- ***Activity diagram***: represents the behavior of a method or the progress of a use case.

- ***Sequence diagram***: represents the chronological order of messages sent and received by a set of objects.

- ***Collaboration diagram***: represents the structural organization of objects that send and receive messages.

- ***State-transition diagram***: represents a sequence of states.

- ***Deployment diagram***: shows the redistribution of the devices (nodes) used in a system as well as the association between the executable programs and these devices.
