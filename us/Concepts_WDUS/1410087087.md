WINDEV allows you to easily use Webservices (or XML Web services). A Webservice is an application available on the Web. WINDEV allows you to access both SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) and REST (Representational State Transfer) Webservices.

Any WINDEV application can use an existing Webservice. 

To use a SOAP Webservice, you just need to get the Webservice address and import its description into the application.

To use a REST Webservice, you only need to get the Webservice characteristics and use [RESTSend](../WDLang3/1000021476.md). 

**Remark**: you can also provide one or more sets of procedures of a WINDEV application as a SOAP or REST Webservice. To do so, you must: 

- create a specific project configuration,

- for a REST Webservice, create a description of the REST Webservice, 

- generate the Webservice,

- deploy it on a WEBDEV Application Server.
