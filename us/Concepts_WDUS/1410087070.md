WINDEV includes multiple methods to optimize your applications:

- **The performance profiler**, which allows you to quickly identify time-consuming processes. You can then optimize the desired process.

- **The static audit of the project**, which points out potential programming issues (empty groups, orphaned elements, etc.) as well as large files that can cause abnormally long loading times.

- **The dynamic audit of the project**, which detects loss of resources, unprocessed errors and slowness of the application in its production environment.
