Project configurations allow you to adapt the same project to multiple "targets".

From the same project, you can create:

- executables with different elements, names, etc.

- different components.

- Webservices.

- .Net assemblies.

The multiple generation allows you to generate all project configurations (or some of them) in a single operation.
