HFSQL Classic is a powerful system for managing relational databases (RDBMS) that can be used on a single computer or in local network. HFSQL Classic does not require the setup of a database server.

The characteristics of HFSQL Classic are as follows:

- An HFSQL Classic application can be run on different client computers distributed across a local network.

- The data files are located in a directory that can be accessed by the client computers (a shared directory on the network, for example). Each client computer physically accesses the data files.

- All processes (requests, read from and write records to a data file, etc.) are performed on each client computer.![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P3-HFSQL%20Classic.gif)
