All elements included in a project are listed in the "Project explorer" pane. By default, the elements are organized according to their type: windows, reports, classes, etc.

In large projects, it is often more practical to group the elements that relate to the same feature: stock management or order management for example.

To do so, create the "Custom-Folders" in the tree structure of the "Project explorer" pane and drag the different elements onto these folders.

Some elements can be common to several "Custom-Folders".

It makes it easier to work on part of the application.

**Remark**: WINDEV also allows you to create internal components to organize your projects and share sets of elements between different projects.
