FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a protocol for transferring files from one site to another. This protocol allows you to exchange files via TCP/IP or the Internet.

## Principle

To handle files on an FTP server from a WINDEV application, you must follow these rules:

1. Connect to an FTP server ([FTPConnect](../WDLang3/3040016.md)). ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P6-Transfert%20de%20fichiers%20par%20FTP.gif)


2. Send and retrieve files (according to the connection mode). For a passive connection, the WINDEV application must request the authorization from the FTP server before any operation is performed on the server files. You can also:

	- get the characteristics of the files located on an FTP server: attributes, size, etc.

	- handle files on an FTP server: create, delete...

	- list files from a directory located on the FTP server by running a procedure that starts a process for each file found.

3. Close the connection to the server ([FTPDisconnect](../WDLang3/3040011.md)). ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P6-Transfert%20de%20fichiers%20par%20FTP-3.gif)
