Unit tests (also called automated tests) are used to test windows, procedures and classes in an application at different levels of development.

To do so, select (or create) the test scenario that will be run.

Test scenarios are generated in WLanguage and can be directly modified.

These scenarios can be found in the test editor. The test editor analyzes the result of the unit tests and calculates the validation rate of the application.![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4-Tests%20Unitaires%20Tests%20automatiques.gif)
To create a unit test on the current window, go to the "Automated tests" tab, "Tests" group, expand "New" and select "Record a new scenario".

To create a unit test on a procedure or on a class method, select the procedure or class method in the "Project explorer" pane and select "Unit tests .. Create a unit test" in the context menu.
