WINDEV is provided with projects that contain components. These projects include: 

- a project configuration corresponding to the component. 

- a project configuration corresponding to the use of the component. 

- an internal component. 




The list of the main components provided with WINDEV is as follows:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| WD BGInfo | This example explains how to write information on the background screen of a computer (IP address, name of the computer, today's date, etc.).<br>This feature can be easily included in an existing application by using the internal component found in this example.   <br><br><br> |
| WD Communication | This example explains how to use the Communication component.<br>This component is used to establish a communication between two distinct applications.<br>These two applications can be found: <br>   - either on remote computers,<br>   - or on the same computer.<br>If the applications are found on two distinct computers, the component is using the sockets (WLanguage SocketXxx functions) to communicate.<br>If the applications are found on the same computer, the component is using the Windows messages to communicate <br>   <br><br><br> |
| WD Email address autocomplete | The Entering emails component enables you to easily enter emails.<br>The example of the component enables you to specify the email addresses of several customers.<br>The assisted input uses the information found on the customer form to help you enter the emails. |
| WD EventLog | WD EventLog<br>This example shows how to use the component for system event log management.<br>In this example, we will cover two main topics:<br>1/ viewing events saved in Windows logs<br>2/ adding events to the Windows Application log<br>Summary of the example provided with WINDEV:<br>This example shows how to use the component to view and modify logs |
| WD Explorer Bar | The WD Explorer Bar component is used to manage an address bar similar to the address bar of the explorer found in Windows Vista.<br>This address bar (also called 'Explorer Breadcrumb') is used to easily navigate in a treeview.<br>You have the ability to add elements by programming, like a TreeView control.<br>You also have the ability to fill the address bar via a TreeView control, and even from one or more HFSQL data files.<br>The navigation in the bar is automatically managed by the component via an internal window. <br>You also have the ability to branch the call to a WLanguage user procedure when an element is clicked. |
| WD Extraction | WD Extraction<br>The extraction of the file content depends on its structure. <br>For some types of files, WINDEV proposes WLanguage functions used to extract their content: HTMLToText, XMLToText , PDFToText (from WINDEV 14), etc.<br>However, for the other files, you will have to identify their structures and program the extraction according to these structures.<br>It may be interesting to store the content of a file in order to perform full-text searches thereafter.<br>This example allows you to easily extract and store the content of various documents (Open Office, Word 2007, ...) in order to find the requested ones via the full-text search.   <br><br><br> |
| WD Floating Windows | The "Floating windows" component is used to display temporary information to the user without disrupting his work.<br>Unlike the BalloonTip, the floating help requires no icon in the taskbar. It can be displayed in any window, including your WINDEV windows. |
| WD Glossary | This example presents the use of the "WD Glossary" component.<br>It allows the application users to classify and store the frequently used sentences.<br>This component allows the application users to easily access a customizable "Glossary". All the glossary entries can be classified in a tree structure |
| WD HTML Page Import | This example explains how HTML pages can be imported with the WLanguage functions.<br>The following topics are presented in this example:<br>1/ how to import an object found on a Web site<br>2/ how to analyze an HTML file<br>Summary of the example supplied with WINDEV:   <br>This example is used to save locally an HTML page found on a Web site. <br>This page is analyzed in order to import all its dependencies (images, applets, and so on). This example is not a Web grabber. It can only be used to download the pages one by one.<br>The principle used in this example can also be used to retrieve informations from pages whose format is recognized (example: daily retrieval of share values) |
| WD LastDocuments | This example explains how the list of last opened documents can be added to the application menu.<br>This insertion is performed via a class proposed in the "LastDocuments" component.<br>Four code lines are sufficient to insert the list of last opened documents into an existing application.<br>These processes can be found in:<br>   - the declaration code of the global variables of the main window, <br>   - the code of the OpenDocument procedure, <br>   - the code of the menu options "File 1" to "File 10".<br>The example has been simplified regarding the number of features (text files only) in order to highlight the use of the component. |
| WD Limitation | Limitation<br>Limiting an application may be useful. Indeed, you may have to create an application in trial version.<br>The Limitation component is used to limit an application according to different methods:<br>   - Limitation regarding the duration (Application limited to 30 days)<br>   - Limitation regarding the number of users (An application cannot be run by more than N users) |
| WD Managing Logs | This example presents the use of the Managing Logs component.<br>This component is used to configure the runtime logs for an application:<br>- number of log files that must be stored,<br>- maximum size of each log file,<br>- information that must be logged.<br>This example simulates different processes to illustrate the management of the logs files (.wlog files). |
| WD Photocopier | The Photocopier component enables you to photocopy documents via a scanner and a printer. The scanner must be Twain-compatible in order for the component to operate.<br>This component can be used in two modes:<br>- With an interface used to define some parameters such as the lightness or the number of copies.<br>- Without interface. The parameters of the computer will be used by default. You also have the ability to pass custom parameters |
| WD PrintModel | This example presents the use of the PrintModel component.<br>This component is used to manage a list of printout models.<br>A printout model groups the different parameters of the printout (Portrait/Landscape, Color/W&B, Number of copies, and so on)<br>With this component, no need to configure the printouts whenever you want to print. |
| WD Printout Parameters | This example is used to illustrate the iParameter function.<br>This function is used to retrieve the different settings defined for a given printer. <br><br>The default printer settings can be modified in Windows directly.<br>Caution, these settings will be used in all your applications.<br><br>Managing the network printers:<br>To modify the default settings of a printer network, make sure that you have the rights for "Managing printers". Otherwise, the modifications made will be ignored.    <br><br><br> |
| WD PrintSpooler | This example presents the use of the PrintSpooler component.<br>This example allows you to propose to the user the printers that are not very much used at this time. |
| WD Progress bars | This example presents the use of progress bars in the windows and it proposes a component to automatically manage a simple or dual progress bar that displays the remaining time or the number of process steps. <br><br><br> |
