WINDEV includes multiple methods to test applications. The table below presents the different modes available.

| Type of test | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Test of the entire project ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_GO_Projet_WB_bl.gif)<br> | Runs the application like the executable file would. Tests the entire application, even if it is not fully developed.<br><br>When a problem occurs during the execution of the project, you can start the debugger to identify and fix the problem.<br><br>Remark: If the number "64" appears on the "Go" icon, it means that the test will be run in 64-bit mode in a 32-bit editor. |
| Test of the current element ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_GO_Fenetre_WD_bl.gif)<br> | Tests an element once it has been developed.<br>You can start the debugger when a problem occurs in reports and windows.<br><br>Remark: If the number "64" appears on the "Go" icon, it means that the test will be run in 64-bit mode in a 32-bit editor. |
| Test of a project step by step<br>(via the debugger) | Allows you to start the debugger when the application is run. This solution is used to monitor the operating mode of the application via the debugger.<br><br>You can also debug a specific executable file, a running executable or an executable file running on another computer. |
| Unit test | Tests windows, procedures and classes in an application at different stages of development.<br><br>The test scenarios are automatically generated in WLanguage from the application test or from the element test. The scenarios can be directly modified in the code editor. |
| Regression test | Used to make sure that an element did not cause any regressions between different versions of an application.<br>To do so, select (or create) the test scenario that will be run. |
