The User Macro-Code (UMC) allows end users to enter their own WLanguage code and include it in an existing application.

Let's consider the following case:
A window for entering a customer form requires an email address but it does not check its format. The user wants to check if the "@" character is in the address.

| An icon at the top of the window <br>allows the user to customize the processes. |   |   |

|   | The UMC configuration window is displayed. <br>The user can add a new action in the window. <br>In this case, the user wants to check the email address. |

| The user types the WLanguage code. <br>The WLanguage help can be started<br>with F1.  |   |   |


To enable this feature (which is disabled by default), simply specify that the project supports the UMC:

- in the project description,

- when creating the executable.
