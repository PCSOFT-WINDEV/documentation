WINDEV includes a debugger to help you optimize your code.

With the debugger, you can run your applications step by step, view the WLanguage code being executed, the content of variables, etc.

**1. Using breakpoints in the code editor**.

The debugger will be automatically started when the line preceded by a breakpoint is run.

To insert a breakpoint, simply click to the left of the line of code: a red dot appears.

**2. Using the STOP keyword in the WLanguage code**

The debugger will be automatically started when this line of code is executed.

**3. Using the "Debug project" option**

The debugger is launched at the same time as the application test. The option "Debug project" can be found on the "Project" tab, under "Test mode".

**4. Pressing Ctrl + Pause during the window or project test**

The debugger starts with the action performed after using Ctrl + Pause.

## Debugging an executable
<a name="debugging_executable_ELTTEXTE000194"></a>
WINDEV also allows you to debug the executable file associated with the current project. This executable file can:

- be run from WINDEV, on the development computer.

- be currently run on the development computer.

- be run from WINDEV, on a remote computer.

- be currently run on a remote computer.

## Debugging a component
<a name="debugging_component_ELTTEXTE000218"></a>
A component is debugged from the component project. You can:

- Test the component from the component project. 

- Test the component by running another project located on the development computer. This allows you to test the component from the project that uses it.

- Test the component by running an executable file located on the development computer. This allows you to test the component directly from the executable file that uses it.
