WINDEV allows you to create control templates. A control template is a set of controls that can be reused in several windows.

Changes made to a control template are automatically applied to all the windows that use the template.

A control template is used to:

- group a set of controls for a specific purpose.

- make the controls independent of the host window.

To create a window based on a control template, create a "Control template" control.

**Remark**: The programming associated with the template elements can be performed in the template directly.

The characteristics of the elements can be dissociated from the template. For example, dissociate the position of a control from the template to move it elsewhere while keeping other changes (code, style, etc.). This is referred to as **control inheritance**. In this case, the elements are identified by a blue square.
