## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000141"></a>
In interactive mode, the WDScript editor is divided into several areas: 

- The ribbon, which contains the most frequently used options,

- The code editor, which allows writing the WLanguage script. 

- The output console, which shows the results of code execution as well as the errors encountered during execution.

## The WDScript ribbon
<a name="the_wdscript_ribbon_ELTTEXTE000165"></a>
The WDScript ribbon has two tabs: 

- The "Home" tab, which includes the different options for handling WLanguage scripts. 

- The "Code" tab, which allows you to handle the WLanguage code. 





### "Home" tab

The "Home" tab allows you to: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WD_Script%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)


- Create and handle a WLanguage script file, via the "New", "Open", "Save" and "Close" options. 

- Run the current script ("GO" option).  

- Change the WDScript options. You can: 

	- Choose the display language of WDScript. 

	- Choose to associate "wl" files generated by WDScript with WDScript or WDScriptConsole. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WD_Script%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.gif)


		- If the wl file is associated with WDScript, it will be automatically opened in the WDScript interface when double-clicked. 

- If the wl file is associated with WDScriptConsole, it will be automatically executed in console mode when double-clicked. 

- include the "Open in WDScript" option in the Windows file explorer. This option will appear in the context menu of the file in the Windows file explorer. 





### "Code" tab
<a name="code_tab_ELTPARAGRAPHE000044"></a>

The "Code" tab allows you to handle the code displayed in the WDScript code editor. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WD_Script%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif)
You can: 

- Comment / Uncomment one or more lines of code 

- Search the displayed script (find a word or go to a specific line). 

- Open the help page for the selected WLanguage function on PC SOFT's documentation website.

## The WDScript code editor
<a name="the_wdscript_code_editor_ELTTEXTE000201"></a>
The WDScript code editor is a simplified version of the code editor in WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile. It is intended for scripts containing shorter and simpler code, compared to its fully-fledged counterpart in the three IDEs.

Features of the WDScript code editor: 

- Syntax highlighting. 

- Simple keyboard shortcuts. 

- Simple code completion. 

- Compilation errors are displayed as tooltips, directly in the code. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WD_Script%20-%20HC%20N%B0005%201.gif)





There are some limitations: 

- The WLanguage script must contain a single block of code. 

- Procedures must be internal procedures. 

- Internal procedures must be declared before being executed. 

- There is no debugger available. 

- Control, window, page or report names cannot be used.

## WDScript output console
<a name="wdscript_output_console_ELTTEXTE000225"></a>
The output console allows you to: 

- View the results returned by the script when run in interactive mode (e.g., **Trace** function). <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WD_Script%20-%20HC%20N%B0004%201.gif)
The return value of the executed code is also displayed. 

- View execution errors when the script is run in interactive mode. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WD_Script%20-%20HC%20N%B0005.gif)





This pane can be undocked and resized. Errors are displayed in red. The ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WD_Script%20-%20HC%20N%B0001%201.gif) button clears the contents of the output window.
