## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000168"></a>
WDScript is a WLanguage script editor included with WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile. WDScript allows you to: 

- write scripts in WLanguage. 

- execute existing WLanguage scripts. 


This makes it possible to automate certain tasks that do not require an interface and that must be launched in "batch" mode (e.g., processing error logs).

### Starting WDScript
<a name="starting_wdscript_ELTPARAGRAPHE000021"></a>

WDScript can be launched in **interactive** mode: 

- from WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile directly: on the "Tools" tab, in the "Utilities" group, click "WDScript". 

- by directly launching the following files, located in the "Programs" subdirectory of the WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile installation directory: 

	- WDScript.exe: Runs the 32-bit version of WDScript. 

	- WDScript64.exe: Runs the 64-bit version of WDScript. 





For more details, see [WDScript: use in interactive mode](../WDScript/1410087245.md). 

WDScript can be launched in **command-line** mode to directly run the desired WLanguage script. 

WDScript can be launched in **"console "** mode via the following executables:  

- WDScriptConsole.exe: Runs the 32-bit version of WDScript in console mode. 

- WDScriptConsole64.exe: Runs the 64-bit version of WDScript in console mode. 




For more details, see [WDScript: use in command-line and console mode](../WDScript/1410087267.md).

### Installing WDScript

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) **Case 1: Setup with WINDEV applications**
 
When creating the setup procedure, you can include WDScript in your WINDEV applications.
Reminder: The setup procedure can be created:

- via the wizard: on the "Project" tab, in the "Generation" group, expand "Setup procedure" and select "Create setup procedure".

- from the setup editor: on the "Tools" tab, in the "Utilities" group, click "WDInst".




**Case 2: Stand-alone setup**
The following files are required to install WDScript:

- WDScript.exe (32-bit) or WDScript64.exe (64-bit): This module is located in the "\\Programs\\" directory of WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile,

- WDScriptConsole.exe (32-bit) or WDScriptConsole64.exe (64-bit): This module is located in the "\\Programs\\" directory of WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile,

- The corresponding framework: since all WLanguage functions can be used, it is necessary to install the full framework. It is located in the following directories:

	- "\\Programs\\Framework\\Win32x86" for WDScript.exe (32-bit),

	- "\\Programs\\Framework\\Win64x86" for WDScript.exe (64-bit).




- The WDTool.wdk component: it can also be found in the "\\Programs\\" directory of WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile.

- The CC280HF.DLL (32-bit) or CC280HF64.DLL (64-bit) file, located in the "\\Programs\\" directory of WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile. These DLLs correspond to the simplified code editor, shared with the HFSQL Control Center.
