The following functions are used to detect objects in images: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [AIDetect](../WDLang6/1410087942.md) | Detects different elements in an image: object, faces, etc, ... This detection is achieved through artificial intelligence (AI). |
| [AIDetectContour](../WDLang6/1410089109.md) | Detects the contours of the shapes in an image. |
| [AIDetectDrawing](../WDLang6/1410089108.md) | Classifies freehand drawings, including circles, squares and triangles. |
| [AIDetectModel](../WDLang6/1410087982.md) | Runs a trained neural network model on an image. This function allows you to use artificial intelligence to detect objects in an image. |



These functions use the following types of variables: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [aiImageResult](../WDLang6/1410087965.md) | The **aiImageResult** type is used to retrieve the result of [AIDetect](../WDLang6/1410087942.md). |
| [aiNeuralNetworkModel](../WDLang6/1410088095.md) | The **aiNeuralNetworkModel** type is used to define all the advanced characteristics of a neural network used by [AIDetectModel](../WDLang6/1410087982.md). |
