### Syntax of the new User Groupware

`<Result> = gpwOpen([<Directory of groupware files>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer constant)`**

Result regarding the opening of login window/page.



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *gpwCancel* | The user clicked the "Cancel" button in the Groupware login window. |
| *gpwError* | An error occurred. For more details, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md). |
| *gpwInvalidPassword* | The password is not valid. It does not correspond to the user password described in the groupware database. |
| *gpwOk* | The user is connected. |
| *gpwUnknownUser* | The user is not listed in the User Groupware database. |



**`<Directory of groupware files>: (Optional character string)`**

These data files are used to manage the users and their rights. By default, these data files are created in a subdirectory of your project (EXE\\GPW_&lt;Project name&gt; directory).
![HFSQL Client/Server](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HFCS.png)   By default, these data files are created on the server in a subdirectory of your database: directory .\\GPW_&lt;Project name&gt;.
If this parameter corresponds to an empty string ("") or if it is not specified, the default directory of the user groupware will be used.

![HFSQL Client/Server](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HFCS.png) If this parameter corresponds to a dot ("."), the data files of user groupware will be created on the server at the root of database.

**`<User files directory>: (Optional character string)`**

These data files can be common to several applications. By default, these data files are created in a subdirectory of your project (EXE\\GPW_&lt;Project name&gt; directory). You can define the location of the User Groupware files common to several applications. In this case, you must specify the path of data files to use.

## Remarks


### How to use gpwOpen?
<a name="how_use_docparampagetitleshort_ELTPARAGRAPHE000209"></a>

**gpwOpen** allows you to define the User Groupware startup mode. This allows you to perform other actions before opening the User Groupware login window or page: execute code, open windows or pages, etc.

Usage example of this function: in a multilingual application that uses the User Groupware, the first window or page of the application is used to choose the runtime language. When creating the application, you must:

- choose not to automatically run the User Groupware during its integration

- open the window or page for language selection as first application window, then call the login window or page with **gpwOpen**.

### Pre-launched sessions
<a name="prelaunched_sessions_ELTPARAGRAPHE000243"></a>

If your project uses pre-launched sessions, this function must not be used in the project initialization event. This function must be used in the "Initializing the project after connection to the site" event.
