Connects a user to an application that is using the User Groupware. This function checks whether the user is registered in the database of the User Groupware. If the user is identified, the application is automatically started by using the rights defined for this user.

**Remark**: No login window is automatically opened: the login and password are directly passed as parameters to the function. The login and password could have been entered in a custom connection window (see the example).

## Example


```wl
// Retrieve the login in a custom window
Login is string
Password is string
Open(WIN_MyLoginWindow, Login, Password)
// Check the login
nRes is int = gpwLogin(Login, Password)
// If the login failed
IF nRes <> gpwOK THEN
	SWITCH nRes
		CASE gpwError: Error("Error while initializing the groupware.")
		CASE gpwUnknownUser: Error("Unknown user.")
		CASE gpwInvalidPassword: Error("Invalid password")
	END
	EndProgram()
END
// Retrieve the first name of user
FirstName is string = gpwGetUserInfo(gpwInfoFirstName)
Info("Welcome" + FirstName)
```

## Syntax

### Directly connect a user to an application via the User Groupware

`<Result> = gpwLogin(<Name> , <Password> [, <Directory of groupware files>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer constant)`**

Result of the connection:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *gpwCancel* | The "Cancel" button was clicked by the user. |
| *gpwError* | An error occurred. For more details, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md). |
| *gpwInvalidPassword* | The password is not valid. It does not correspond to the user password described in the groupware database. |
| *gpwManagement* | The groupware in management mode. |
| *gpwOk* | The user is connected |
| *gpwUnknownUser* | The user is not referenced in the database of user groupware. |



**`<Name>: (Character string)`**

Username.

**`<Password>: (Character string)`**

Password associated with the login of the user, empty string (" ") if no password.

**`<Directory of groupware files>: (Optional character string)`**

These data files are used to manage the users and their rights. By default, these data files are created in a subdirectory of your project (EXE\\GPW_&lt;Project name&gt; directory).
If this parameter corresponds to an empty string ("") or if it is not specified, the default directory of the user groupware will be used.

### Syntax of the former User Groupware (kept for backward compatibility)

`<Result> = gpwLogin(<Name> , <Password> [, <Directory of rights file> [, <User files directory>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer constant)`**

Result of the connection:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *gpwCancel* | The "Cancel" button was clicked by the user. |
| *gpwError* | An error occurred. For more details, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md). |
| *gpwInvalidPassword* | The password is not valid. It does not correspond to the user password described in the groupware database. |
| *gpwOk* | The user is connected |
| *gpwUnknownUser* | The user is not referenced in the database of user groupware. |



**`<Name>: (Character string)`**

Username.

**`<Password>: (Character string)`**

Password associated with the login of the user, empty string (" ") if no password.

**`<Directory of rights file>: (Optional character string)`**

These data files are used to manage the rights granted to the users for the different windows of the application. These files are specific to the application. By default, these data files are created in a subdirectory of your project (EXE\\GPW_&lt;Project name&gt; directory).

If this parameter corresponds to an empty string ("") or if it is not specified, the default directory of the user groupware will be used.

**`<User files directory>: (Optional character string)`**

These data files can be common to several applications. By default, these data files are created in a subdirectory of your project (EXE\\GPW_&lt;Project name&gt; directory). You can define the location of the User Groupware files common to several applications. In this case, you must specify the path of data files to use.

If this parameter corresponds to an empty string ("") or if it is not specified, the default directory of the user groupware will be used.
