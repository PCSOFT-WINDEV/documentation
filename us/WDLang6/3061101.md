## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000153"></a>
WINDEV gives you the ability to lock your applications (after a specific duration for example).

All the application windows are minimized and made invisible. A password is required when the user wants to restore the application. The following window is displayed by default:<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Verrouillage_appli%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)
This password can correspond to:

- the Windows password of the current computer (by default), 

- the user password defined in the user groupware (if the user groupware is used by your application), 

- a specific password, defined by [LockAppPassword](../WDLang6/1000017010.md).




The application can be locked:

- from the characteristics of the project.

- programmatically with the [lock functions](../WDLang6/3061100.md).

## How to?

### Implementing the application lock from the editor

To implement the lock of your application:

1. Open the project description: on the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, click "Description".

2. Go to the "Advanced" tab. 

3. In the "Application security" section, check "Automatically lock the application if it remains idle during: " and specify the idle time before locking the application.

4. Validate.

### Implementing the application lock through programming
<a name="implementing_the_application_lock_through_programming_ELTPARAGRAPHE000065"></a>

To programmatically lock the application, use [LockXXX](../WDLang6/3061100.md).

### Modifying the window used to lock the application
<a name="modifying_the_window_used_lock_the_application_ELTPARAGRAPHE000075"></a>

If the automatic lock is used by your application, the locking window does not appear in your project. However, the skin template of the project can be applied to it by using [ChangeSkinTemplate](../WDLang1/3013026.md).

To customize the lock window and to translate it:

1. Include the "WinDevLockApp.wdw" window in your project. This window is found in the "Programs\\Data\\Preset windows\\AAF" directory of WINDEV. 
	**Tip**: To include this window in your project, go to the "Project" tab, "Project" group, expand "Import" and select "WINDEV elements and their dependencies".

2. Modify the window according to your requirement. Caution: the window must not be renamed.




Remarks: 

- If the lock window is included in your application, you may not benefit from the improvements made to this window during the different updates. Don't forget to check whether this window has evolved.

- **Caution**: To modify this window, the corresponding file must not be read-only. Modify the characteristics of the file in Windows if necessary.
