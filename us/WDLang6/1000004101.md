## Remarks




### Opening and closing the door of the player
<a name="opening_and_closing_the_door_the_player_ELTPARAGRAPHE000058"></a>

- **CDEject**(&lt;Player&gt;,True) has no effect if the door of the player is already opened. **CDEject**(&lt;Player&gt;, False) has no effect if the door of the player is already closed.

- Some players may ignore the request for closing the door. In this case, **CDEject** returns <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> even if the player door remains opened.
