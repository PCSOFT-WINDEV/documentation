## Remarks




### Conversion from PDF to text
<a name="conversion_from_pdf_text_ELTPARAGRAPHE000068"></a>

- The formatting of the document is lost when the conversion is performed from PDF to text.

- The text is extracted in the order or appearance of the PDF commands and it is sequentially written into the result string. The organization of the text in paragraphs and in blocks is kept (as well as the CR characters).  

- The Unicode characters are not returned.

- The data found in a PDF form is not extracted (this data is not stored in the PDF file).
