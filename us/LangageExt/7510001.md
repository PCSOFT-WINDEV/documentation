## Use
<a name="use_ELTTEXTE000553"></a>
Calls a WLanguage function from an external language.

**Caution**: This function must not be used in a WINDEV application. Indeed, this function is not a WLanguage function.

**Using specific preset functions**


```txt
// From a program written in C, C++, Java or Visual Basic
// Open the "Window" window 
CallWD("Open,Window.WDW")
// Switch the window to edit
CallWD("Screen,Input")
// Call a global WLanguage procedure
CallWD("pMyCollection.CalculateOrder(2451478)")
```


**Using the entire WLanguage code** (slower because performs a dynamic compilation of code)


```txt
// From a program written in Pascal...
// Open the "Window" window 
CallWD('Open,Window.WDW')
// Call a global WLanguage procedure
CallWD('pMyCollection.CalculateOrder(2451478)')
```

### Details of parameters 
<a name="details_parameters_ELTPARAGRAPHE000072"></a>

***&lt;Function name&gt;***: Character string
Name of the function to call. This function corresponds to:    

- a WLanguage function.   

- a function specific to the external language. For more details, see [remarks](#NOTE3_1).




***&lt;Function parameters&gt;***: Character string
Parameters of function called.
The different parameters are separated by a comma.
If the parameters are enclosed in double quotes or in single quotes, they must be doubled.

***&lt;WLanguage code&gt;***: Character string
WLanguage code to run.
The code will compiled dynamically and run. It can be: 

- a simple call to a function, most frequent case,

- a complex WLanguage code built dynamically.


As the code is compiled dynamically, there is a compilation step that makes this type of calls less efficient than the calls that use preset functions in external language.
Remark: If double quotes or single quotes are found in the string, they must be doubled.

### Function specific to the external language
<a name="function_specific_the_external_language_ELTPARAGRAPHE000113"></a>

Some actions are automatically performed by WINDEV (a window automatically becomes editable when it is opened for example). This is the reason why no WLanguage function can be used to perform these actions.

However, when using a WINDEV element from a program written in an external language, these actions must be specified.

The following functions are used to perform the actions automatically performed by WINDEV:
