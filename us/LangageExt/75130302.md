## Syntax

`Project(<Project name>)`
---

**`<Project name>: (Character string)`**

Name of the project to start. When running the project, the style sheet of the project library is loaded.  



<a name="NOTE0"></a>
<a name="NOTE0_1"></a>

## Remarks


- Important: **Project** must be called after [Library,Disk](../LangageExt/7513024.md) and before HInit.

- If a first window was selected in the list of projects, this window will be opened by **Project**. To avoid opening a window, select &lt;None&gt; as first window in the list of project windows.

- A program written in C or in Pascal may only contain the function for starting the project.

- WdKey contains "\*E\*" if an error occurred during the opening.

- If a window calls some global variables or procedures, the project must be run by Project before opening the window, otherwise the global variables or procedures and the style sheet will not be recognized.

- Several projects can be called in the same program. To do so, the current project must be closed before opening another one. To close the current project, use the following syntax:

	- Example in C: 
			
		```txt
		HInit(&stArrCtn[0],NBCTN);
		CALLWD("LIBRA,,DISK,MYLIBRARY");
		CALLWD("PROJECT,MyProject");
		```


	- Example in Pascal: 
			
		```txt
		HInit;
		CALLWD('PROJECT, LIBRARY,DISK,MYLIBRARY');
		CALLWD('PROJECT, MyProject');
		```


	- Example in VB: 
			
		```txt
		call HInit
		call CALLWD("PROJECT, BLIBRARY,DISK,MYLIBRARY ")
		call CALLWD("PROJECT, MyProject ")
		```
