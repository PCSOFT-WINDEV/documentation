## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = awSendAndGetInfo(<Data> , <WLanguage procedure>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the sending was successful,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) returns more details about the error.




**`<Data>: (Buffer)`**

Data to send.

**`<WLanguage procedure>: (Procedure name)`**

Name of the WLanguage procedure ("callback") called when the response is received. This procedure is used to retrieve and process the response.
This procedure has the following format:

```txt
PROCEDURE <Procedure name>(<Response>)
```

where &lt;Response&gt; is a Buffer variable.



<a name="NOTE0"></a>
<a name="NOTE0_1"></a>

## Remarks


- The receiver receives the data sent via the procedure passed to [awProcedureGetAndSendInfo](../WDLang3/1000022118.md). Then, the receiver must send a response in return value of this procedure. 

- The data is immediately sent. 

	- From "Watch to Phone": if the iOS application is not started, it will be automatically started in background in order to respond to the call. 

	- From "Phone to Watch": if the Apple Watch application is not started, an error is generated by the call. 




- The messages are delivered in the order in which they have been sent.
