## Syntax

### Displaying the progress bar in a Progress Bar control

`EmailProgressBar(<Name of Progress Bar control> [, <Frequency>])`
---

**`<Name of Progress Bar control>: (Character string)`**

Name of the Progress Bar control where the progress bar will be displayed. This control must exist in the current window.

If this parameter corresponds to an empty string (""), the current progress bar is canceled.

**`<Frequency>: (Optional integer)`**

Specifies the frequency for refreshing the progress bar (in bytes). The default frequency is set to 10.000 (the progress bar is refreshed every 10 KB). 
**Caution**: this frequency is given for information only.

### Managing the progress bar via a procedure

`EmailProgressBar(<WLanguage procedure> [, <Frequency>])`
---

**`<WLanguage procedure>: (Procedure name)`**

Name of the WLanguage procedure that will manage the progress bar. 
This procedure has the following format:

```txt
PROCEDURE <Procedure name> (<Total>, <Progress>)
```
where: 

- &lt;Total&gt; is the number of bytes to transmit or to receive.

- &lt;Progress&gt; is the number of bytes already transmitted or received.




These parameters can be used in the procedure at any time.

If this parameter corresponds to an empty string (""), the current progress bar is canceled.

**`<Frequency>: (Optional integer)`**

Specifies the frequency for refreshing the progress bar (in bytes). The default frequency is set to 10,000 (the procedure is called every 10 KB). 
**Caution**: this frequency is given for information only.

### Managing the progress bar via an event

`EmailProgressBar(<Event name> [, <Frequency>])`
---

**`<Event name>: (Character string)`**

Name of the event that will be run during the progress. This event must be processed by [Event](../WDLang1/3015011.md). In this case: 

- the wParam parameter (the 1st parameter of the event) will correspond to the amount of bytes to send

- the lParam parameter (2nd parameter of the event) will correspond to the amount of bytes already sent. 
	If this parameter corresponds to an empty string (""), the current progress bar is canceled.




**`<Frequency>: (Optional integer)`**

Specifies the frequency for refreshing the progress bar (in bytes). The default frequency is set to 10,000 (the event is triggered every 10 KB). 
**Caution**: this frequency is given for information only.
