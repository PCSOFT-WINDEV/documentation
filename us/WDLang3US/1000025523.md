**MapImage** variables are used to define the characteristics of an image to be drawn on the map displayed in a Map control. The characteristics of this image can be defined and changed using different WLanguage properties. 

**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

## Example


```wl
// Add an image to the Map control
i is MapImage
i.Position = MyPosition
i.Image = "image.png"
i.ActionClick = ClickProc
MapAddImage(MAP_MyMap, i)

INTERNAL PROCEDURE ClickProc(i is MapImage)
	ToastDisplay(StringBuild("Click on the <%1> image.", i.Name))
END
```

### Properties specific to MapImage variables
<a name="properties_specific_mapimage_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000029"></a>

The following properties can be used to handle an image in a Map control:

| Property name | Type used | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ActionClick | Procedure name | Name of the WLanguage procedure called when the user clicks the image displayed in the Map control. This procedure has the following format: <br><br><pre><code>PROCEDURE <Procedure name>(<Image>)</code></pre><br>where &lt;Image&gt; is a **MapImage** variable corresponding to the image the user clicked on. <br><br>If this property is not specified (or corresponds to an empty string ("")), no action will be performed on click.<br><br>Remark: it is recommended to use global procedures. If the procedure is local, its name must be prefixed by the full name of the object to which the procedure belongs (example for a local window procedure: "WIN_Window1.MyProcedure").<br><br> |
| Alignment | Integer constant | Alignment of the image with respect to the position given by the **Position** property : <br><br>- *mkTop*: image above the position. <br><br>- *mkBottom*: image below the position. <br><br>- *mkCenter* (Default value): image centered on the position. <br><br>- *mkRight*: image to the right of the position. <br><br>- *mkLeft*: image to the left of the position. <br><br><br> |
| Angle | Integer | Rotation angle in degrees (between 0 and 360) to be applied to the image. The rotation is performed using the position given by the **Position** property as the center of rotation.<br><br>This property is set to 0 by default. |
| Description | Character string | Description of the image, used to store additional information, for example. |
| Height | Real | Height (in meters) that the image should occupy on the map. <br><br>If this property is not specified in or is set to 0, the height will be automatically calculated according to the width specified via the **Width** property, respecting the image ratio. |
| Image | Character string <br>or [Image](../WDLang1/1000019650.md) variable | Image to display. This property corresponds to: <br><br>- a character string corresponding to the path of the image,<br><br>- a variable of type [Image](../WDLang1/1000019650.md).<br><br><br>This image cannot be a vector image (SVG). |
| Name | Character string | Image name. A name is automatically assigned when the variable is created. It can be modified, but it has to be unique if the shape is added to the Map control. This name can be used to delete the image with [MapDeleteImage](../WDLang3/1000025534.md). |
| Opacity | Integer | Image opacity percentage. By default, this property is set to 100. |
| Position | [geoPosition](../WDLang3/1000019191.md) | Geographic position at which the image is to be drawn. The alignment of the image with respect to this position is given by the **Alignment** property. |
| Width | Real | Width (in meters) that the image should occupy on the map. <br><br>**This property must be specified.** |
| ZOrder | Integer | Z-order of the image in relation to the other shapes in the Map control. Allows you to manage overlays. <br><br>A shape with a high Z-order will be drawn over a shape with a lower Z-order. <br><br>This property is set to 0 by default. <br><br> |

<a name="wlanguage_functions_ELTPARAGRAPHE000158"></a>The following WLanguage functions are used to handle **MapImage** variables: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [MapAddImage](../WDLang3/1000025532.md) | Adds a new image to the map displayed in a Map control. |
| [MapDeleteImage](../WDLang3/1000025534.md) | Deletes an image drawn on the map displayed in a Map control. |
| [MapModifyImage](../WDLang3/1000025533.md) | Modifies an image drawn on the map displayed in a Map control. |
