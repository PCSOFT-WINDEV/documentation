	 This feature is reserved for advanced use to manage special cases.. In most cases, we recommend importing the wsdl of the SOAP webservice. For more details, see [Importing/Consuming Webservices](../WDLang3/3086001.md).

## SOAP
<a name="soap_ELTTEXTE000115"></a>
SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a communication protocol used to run procedures on a remote server. This protocol is mainly based on the HTTP and XML protocols. It can also be used with the SMTP protocol.

The data is transmitted between the local computer and the SOAP server as text in XML format (Extensible Markup Language).

**Benefits of SOAP protocol**
The main benefit of the SOAP protocol is that it is based on two standard protocols:

- XML: for the structure of messages.

- HTTP: for the transfer of data.




For this reason, the SOAP protocol is independent from the operating systems and from the programming languages. The SOAP protocol promotes interoperability.

Furthermore, the use of the HTTP protocol (for data transfer) allows the SOAP protocol to go through firewalls without any problem.

## WINDEV and the SOAP protocol
<a name="windev_and_the_soap_protocol_ELTTEXTE000139"></a>
WINDEV lets you create a **[SOAP client application](../WDLang3/3069008.md)**. This application uses the SOAP functions of WLanguage to make the SOAP server run procedures and to retrieve their result.

**Remark**: The transfers are not secured at the moment (the data transferred is not encrypted). The SOAP protocol should not be used to transfer sensitive data.

The version of SOAP used for the use of Webservices is 1.1 and 1.2.
