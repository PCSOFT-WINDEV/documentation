## Configuring the SOAP administrator
<a name="configuring_the_soap_administrator_ELTTEXTE000099"></a>
**To configure the SOAP administrator**: 

1. Start the SOAP administrator (WDSOAPConfig.EXE). This administrator is found in the setup directory of your application (or in a specific directory if it is already installed). On the development computer, this administrator is available in the "Programs\\Data" directory of WINDEV. ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ConfigSOAP.gif)


2. Configure the different elements:

	- **Time before unloading an unused WDL**: If several libraries (WDL file) corresponding to SOAP server applications (or to XML Web services) are found on the computer, this option is used to configure the maximum timeout before deleting an unused library from the memory. The end code of the project will be run during this deletion.

	- **Maximum number of WDLs in memory**: If several libraries (WDL file) corresponding to SOAP server applications (or to XML Web services) are found on the computer, this option is used to configure the number of WDLs loaded in memory at the same time. When this number is reached, the less recent library is automatically closed. The end code of the project will be run during this closing.

	- **Saving a log (.LOG)**: This option is used to save in a text file all the operations performed on the SOAP server. The date and time are specified for each operation. This file can contain the following messages for example: 
			
		```txt
		Loading the WDL X
		Receiving a request: calling the X function of WDL Y
		The call to the X function failed
		The call to the X function was successful
		The limit of WDL in memory was reached
		Unloading WDL X
		```





- **Log file**: Server directory into which the log file must be created.

- **Location of the WDLs**: Server directory where the libraries of the SOAP Server applications are located. 
			Remark: if the directory does not exist, the WDLs will be sought in the C:\\soapmodules directory.

- **Location of WINDEV DLLs**: Server directory where the WINDEV DLLs used by the SOAP Server applications are found. 
			Remark: if the directory does not exist, the DLLs will be sought in the C:\\soapmodules directory.

- **Location of files at runtime**: Directory of the HyperFileSQL files. 
			When loading the library of the SOAP server:

	- The analysis associated with the SOAP server will be automatically loaded.

	- The data directory specified in the analysis will automatically correspond to this directory.
