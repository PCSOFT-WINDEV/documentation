## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000162"></a>
The Bluetooth LE standard (for Low Energy) is used to manage devices with low energy consumption.

It is fundamental for the "IoT" technology (Internet of Things). The purpose of this standard is to allow connected objects to operate for several months without changing batteries!

## Implementing the management of Bluetooth Low Energy devices
<a name="implementing_the_management_bluetooth_low_energy_devices_ELTTEXTE000186"></a>
Several WLanguage functions and types can be used to manage Bluetooth Low Energy devices in a WINDEV or WINDEV Mobile application. 

The principle for using these functions and types is as follows: 

1. Initialize the Bluetooth Low Energy with [BTLEInitialize](../WDLang3/1000022110.md). 
	

2. Load the list of accessible devices ([BTLEListDevice](../WDLang3/1000021882.md)). 

3. Select the desired device. 

	- ![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png) Select the desired device and initialize it with [BTLEInitializeDevice](../WDLang3/1410087620.md).


 The status of the connection can be checked by [BTLEConnectionStatus](../WDLang3/1000022068.md). 

4. If the connection is established with the device, you have the ability to find out the list of its services ([BTLEGetAllServices](../WDLang3/1000022114.md)). 
	Remark: To get a specific service, use [BTLEGetAService](../WDLang3/1000022111.md). 

5. Select the requested device and load the list of service characteristics ([BTLEGetAllCharacteristics](../WDLang3/1000022115.md)). 
	Remark: To get a characteristic, use [BTLEGetACharacteristic](../WDLang3/1000022113.md). 

6. Select the requested characteristic. You can: 

	- Read the value of the characteristic ([BTLECharacteristicReadValue](../WDLang3/1000022069.md)). 

	- Write the value of the characteristic ([BTLECharacteristicWriteValue](../WDLang3/1000022070.md)).  

	- Enable the notification whenever the value of a characteristic changes ([BTLECharacteristicChangeOfValue](../WDLang3/1000022071.md)).




7. For each characteristic, you also have the ability to retrieve the associated descriptor. This descriptor describes the data exchanged between two devices compatible with Bluetooth Low Energy: unit of the value, range of values, ... You can: 

	- Read the value of the descriptor ([BTLEDescriptorReadValue](../WDLang3/1000022072.md)). 

	- Modify the value of the descriptor ([BTLEDescriptorReadValue](../WDLang3/1000022072.md)).
