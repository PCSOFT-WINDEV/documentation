## Principle
<a name="principle_ELTTEXTE000138"></a>
Secure Shell (SSH) is a secure communication protocol. The exchanged data is secured via encryption keys.

A server can support the secure SSH protocol to receive remote commands. 

WINDEV and WEBDEV propose several functions allowing you to connect, start a session, transmit commands to run and retrieve the result of these commands.

The protocol is SSH-2. 

Two methods can be used to communicate with an SSH server:

- [Send the Shell commands directly](#NOTE2_1),

- [Communicating with an SSH server](#NOTE2_2).

## How to?

### Direct sending of commands
<a name="direct_sending_commands_ELTPARAGRAPHE000057"></a>

The direct sending of commands is performed by [SSHCommand](../WDLang3/1000021143.md). The parameters for connecting to the SSH server must be described in an [sshSession](../WDLang3/1000021157.md) variable.

Example: 


```wl
cMySession is sshSession
buffOutput is Buffer
cMySession.Address = "127.0.0.1"
cMySession.Port = 22
cMySession.User = "login"
cMySession.UserPassword = "pass"
nExitCode is int
sOutput is ANSI string
sOutputErr is ANSI string
(nExitCode, sOutput, sOutputErr) = SSHCommand(cMySession, EDT_Command)
IF ErrorOccurred THEN
	Error(ErrorInfo(errFullDetails))
	RETURN
END
EDT_ExitCode = nExitCode
EDT_StdOut = UTF8ToString(sOutput)
EDT_StdErr = UTF8ToString(sOutputErr)
```

<a name="NOTE2_2"></a>


### Dialog with an SSH server
<a name="dialog_with_ssh_server_ELTPARAGRAPHE000076"></a>The dialog with the SSH server is performed by the following functions:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [SSHConnectShell](../WDLang3/1000021147.md) | Starts a new SSH session of "Shell" type. |
| [SSHDisconnectShell](../WDLang3/1000021148.md) | Closes an SSH session that was opened by [SSHConnectShell](../WDLang3/1000021147.md). |
| [SSHRead](../WDLang3/1000021149.md) | Reads the data found on the output buffer of the SSH session. |
| [SSHWrite](../WDLang3/1000021150.md) | Writes data into the specified SSH session. |



The parameters for connecting to the SSH server must be described in an [sshSession](../WDLang3/1000021157.md) variable.

Example:

```wl
cMySession is sshSession
cMySession.Address = "127.0.0.1"
cMySession.Port = 22
cMySession.User = "login"
cMySession.UserPassword = "pass"
IF SSHConnectShell(cMySession) THEN
	Info("Session started")
	bufOutput is Buffer = "data"
	SSHWrite(cMySession, bufOutput)
	SSHDisconnectShell(cMySession)
END
```
