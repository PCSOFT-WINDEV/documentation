The following functions are used to manage sockets:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [SocketAccept](../WDLang3/3070004.md) | Run on the server, this function accepts a request for connecting to an existing socket found on the server. |
| [SocketChangeTransmissionMode](../WDLang3/3070005.md) | Changes the transmission mode used on a socket. |
| [SocketClientInfo](../WDLang3/3070009.md) | Allows the server to get information about the current client socket. |
| [SocketClose](../WDLang3/3070015.md) | Closes a socket or a connection to a server socket. |
| [SocketConfigure](../WDLang3/1410088949.md) | Configures the use of Socket functions. |
| [SocketConnect](../WDLang3/3070016.md) | Connects a client computer to a given socket. |
| [SocketConnectBluetooth](../WDLang3/1000017145.md) | Connects a client computer to a specific Bluetooth socket. |
| [SocketConnectInfrared](../WDLang3/3070018.md) | Connects a client computer to a given socket via the infrared port. |
| [SocketConnectSSL](../WDLang3/1000017042.md) | Used to establish a secure connection to an SSL server. |
| [SocketCreate](../WDLang3/3070011.md) | Creates a socket. |
| [SocketCreateBluetooth](../WDLang3/1000017167.md) | Creates a socket using a Bluetooth device. |
| [SocketCreateInfrared](../WDLang3/3070012.md) | Creates a socket that is using the infrared port. |
| [SocketCreateSSL](../WDLang3/1000017041.md) | Creates a secure socket according to the SSL protocol. |
| [SocketCreateUDP](../WDLang3/3070019.md) | Creates a socket that is using the UDP protocol. |
| [SocketDeny](../WDLang3/3070010.md) | Run on the server, this function refuses a request for connection to an existing socket found on the server. |
| [SocketExist](../WDLang3/3070013.md) | Checks the existence of socket. |
| [SocketProxy](../WDLang3/1410088761.md) | Specifies whether TCP sockets and WebSockets must go through a SOCKS5 proxy to execute requests. |
| [SocketRead](../WDLang3/3070014.md) | Retrieves a message sent by another socket. |
| [SocketWaitForConnection](../WDLang3/3070006.md) | Run on the server, this function is used to wait for a connection request coming from the client sockets. |
| [SocketWrite](../WDLang3/3070002.md) | Writes a message intended to another socket. |
| [WebSocketClientConnect](../WDLang3/1410087751.md) | Establishes a connection between the client and a WebSocket server. |
| [WebSocketClientConnectSSL](../WDLang3/1410087752.md) | Establishes an SSL connection between the client and a WebSocket server. |

To use this example, a list of contacts must be entered in your address book. The contacts must be identified by a name and the IP address of their computer. When the application is started, the program searches for the accessible contacts (which means the ones who have started this application on their computer). When you double-click a "connected" contact, a discussion window is opened, giving you the ability to communicate with the contact

To use this example, a first instance of the example must be started in "server" mode. Then, by specifying the name of the computer that will be used as server and a nickname, you can connect to this application in "client" mode. You now have the ability to send messages to all the connected users. In this example, a thread and a socket are associated with each connection.

This example allows you to understand the principle of dialog via socket between two applications.<br>Therefore, in the applications that dialog via socket, even if no trace option as implemented by the developers, you will have he ability to view all the exchanges performed on the socket.<br>This example also enables you to understand the operating mode of the network protocols based on the sockets: POP3, SMTP, FTP, HTTP, and so on.<br>Note for the users who are experienced in network communication: <br>This example does not allow you to trace the UDP packages (only the TCP communications can be traced).
