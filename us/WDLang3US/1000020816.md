## Example


```wl

NotifPushEnable(RegisterPushNotif)
```

```wl
// Manage the registration
PROCEDURE RegisterPushNotif(Token is Buffer, NotifError is string)
IF Length(Token) > 0 THEN
	// Informs the application server about the new identifier
	SendIDOnServer(Token)
ELSE

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`NotifPushEnable(<WLanguage procedure> [, <Options>])`
---

**`<WLanguage procedure>: (Procedure name)`**

Name of the WLanguage procedure called when the application receives the registration identifier from the notification service.

**`<Options>: (Combination of optional Integer constants)`**

Registration options. Can correspond to one or more of the following constants: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *notifPushAlertType* | The mobile application will accept the push notifications in alert format. <br><br> |
| *notifPushAllNotif*<br>(Default value) | The mobile application will accept all types of push notifications. |
| *notifPushBadgeType* | The mobile application will accept the push notifications in badge format. <br><br> |
| *notifPushSoundType* | The mobile application will accept the sound push notifications. <br><br> |


Caution: These options are taken into account during the first application setup. Then, the user can modify the notifications accepted in the Notification Center of device.

## Remarks


### WLanguage procedure called
<a name="wlanguage_procedure_called_ELTPARAGRAPHE000073"></a>

The WLanguage procedure called by **NotifPushEnable** must have the following syntax:


```txt
PROCEDURE RegisterPushNotif(<Identifier> is Buffer, <Error> is string)
```


This procedure is called when the registration toward the notification service is ended.

The parameters of this procedure are as follows: 

- &lt;Identifier&gt;: "Token" buffer corresponding to the registration identifier returned by the notification service. This buffer must be transmitted to the application server so that push notifications can be sent to the application. 
	**Caution**: This buffer must be transmitted to the application server:

	- when its value changed in relation to the previous execution of the application. To do so, its value must be stored in a data file of the application or in a buffer on disk created by [fSaveBuffer](../WDLang1/1000019412.md) or [SaveParameter](../WDLang1/3025046.md).

	- if the application is started by the user (and not by the arrival of a push notification). [ExeInfo](../WDLang1/3035001.md) determines whether the application is started when a notification is received.


 This buffer can be empty if a registration error occurred during the registration request. In this case, the &lt;Error&gt; parameter will be filled with the error message.
	
	

- &lt;Error&gt;: Character string describing a registration error. This parameter is filled only if an error occurred during the registration request.

### Special cases
<a name="special_cases_ELTPARAGRAPHE000123"></a>

- **NotifPushEnable** is asynchronous because it executes a request: 








- ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WMPush.gif) ***Cross-platform examples*** : **WM Push** <br>This example shows how to receive Push notifications.<br>It calls the PushNotifActive function and returns the identifier to "WD Push Server", which stores it.<br>Then, the "Send Push" example reads this identifier and sends Push notifications to this example.
