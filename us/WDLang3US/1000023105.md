The **beaconGroup** type is used to define the advanced characteristics for a set of Beacons. The characteristics of this set of Beacons can be defined and changed via different WLanguage properties. 

**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

Reminder: Beacons use Bluetooth Low Energy technology to emit a triplet of values: 

- UUID (Universally Unique Identifier, also known as Proximity UUID): unique identifier that generally represents the organization or the person to which the Beacon belongs.

- Major: number used to identify a group of Beacons within the same organization (same UUID) 

- Minor: number used to identify a specific Beacon within the same group (same UUID and same Major number).


This triplet is used to identify the Beacon in a unique way. 

by using the first value or the first two values of the triplet, you can determine whether a Beacon belongs to an organization and/or to a sub-group of this organization.

## Example


```wl
// Group of all Beacons from the same organization
group is beaconGroup
group.UUID = "f4231ab6-5ef2-6c99-4229-af6c72e0446e" 

// Group of all Beacon tags belonging to the same organization with Major number 5
group is beaconGroup
group.UUID = "f4231ab6-5ef2-6c99-4229-af6c72e0446e" 
group.Major = 5

// Unique Beacon
group is beaconGroup
group.UUID = "f4231ab6-5ef2-6c99-4229-af6c72e0446e" 
group.Major = 5
group.Minor = 1
```

### Properties specific to beaconGroup variables
<a name="properties_specific_beacongroup_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000039"></a>

The following properties can be used to handle a group of Beacons:

| Property name | Type used | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Description | Character string | Description of the group of Beacons. |
| Major | Integer | Integer included between -1 and 65535 describing the Major number of the group of Beacons. <br><br>- The default property value is set to -1. This value means that the Major number will be ignored to determine whether a Beacon belongs to the group. <br><br>- If the value of this property has been specified (other than -1), the **UUID** property must also be specified.<br><br><br> |
| Minor | Integer | Integer included between -1 and 65535 describing the Minor number of the group of Beacons. <br><br>- The default property value is set to -1. This value means that the Minor number will be ignored to determine whether a Beacon belongs to the group. <br><br>- If the value of this property has been specified (other than -1), the **UUID** and **Major** properties must also be specified.<br><br><br> |
| UUID | Character string | Identifier (GUID) common to Beacons of the group. This identifier includes 32 hexadecimal digits separated into 5 groups. Each group must contain the following number of digits: <br><br>- 1st group: 8 digits.<br><br>- 2nd group: 4 digits.<br><br>- 3rd group: 4 digits.<br><br>- 4th group: 4 digits.<br><br>- 5th group: 12 digits.<br><br><br>The different groups are separated by a dash. <br><br>Example of valid identifier: f4231ab6-5ef2-6c99-4229-af6c72e0446e<br><br>This identifier is mandatory in order for the group to be valid. |
