## Syntax

`StreamPlay(<Stream identifier> [, <Type of stream>])`
---

**`<Stream identifier>: (Integer)`**

Identifier of the stream to use. This identifier is defined in the "Connection request of new stream" event associated with the stream. It can also be returned by using the [Value](../Proprietes/2510130.md) property on the stream, or by using the name of the stream directly.

**`<Type of stream>: (Optional Integer constant (or combination of constants))`**

Type of stream to resume:

- Simple constants: 
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *StreamIncomingSound* | Incoming sound stream. |
| *StreamIncomingVideo* | Incoming video stream. |
| *StreamOutgoingSound* | Outgoing sound stream. |
| *StreamOutgoingVideo* | Outgoing video stream. |



- Constants corresponding to a combination of constants: 
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *StreamAll*<br>(default value) | Video + Sound stream (*StreamFullDuplexSound*+ *StreamFullDuplexVideo*). |
| *StreamFullDuplexSound* | Incoming and outgoing sound stream (corresponds to *StreamOutgoingSound* + *StreamIncomingSound*). |
| *StreamFullDuplexVideo* | Incoming and outgoing video stream (corresponds to *StreamOutgoingVideo* + *FluxVidéoRéception*). |

## Remarks


### Procedure for stream detection
<a name="procedure_for_stream_detection_ELTPARAGRAPHE000197"></a>

A stream is associated with the event "Connection request of new stream". This event is run when a request to connect to an incoming stream is detected.

This event is run in one of the following cases: 

- if the [Detection](../Proprietes/2510031.md) property applied to the stream is set to <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>.

- if the option "Detection of active incoming streams" has been checked in the stream description window.




**Remark**: This event is run in a specific thread of WLanguage. Therefore, it is subject to limitations specific to the threads. For more details on threads, see [Managing threads with WINDEV](../WDLang1/3077026.md).

Furthermore, with instant messaging, you have the ability to send a file to your contact and to dialog with him.
