The following constants are used by the Modbusxxx functions:

| Constant | Details | Function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **modbusABCD** | Mode for storing float values on the slave device. Bytes are identified from A to D. A is the most significant byte and D is the least significant byte (IEEE-754 standard).<br><br>The sent bytes are stored the same order on the slave device. | [ModbusWriteFloat](../WDLang3/1000025933.md)<br>[ModbusReadFloat](../WDLang3/1000025936.md) |
| **modbusBADC** | Mode for storing float values on the slave device. Bytes are identified from A to D. A is the most significant byte and D is the least significant byte (IEEE-754 standard).<br><br>The sent bytes are swapped 2 by 2 on the slave device. | [ModbusWriteFloat](../WDLang3/1000025933.md)<br>[ModbusReadFloat](../WDLang3/1000025936.md) |
| **modbusCDAB** | Mode for storing float values on the slave device. Bytes are identified from A to D. A is the most significant byte and D is the least significant byte (IEEE-754 standard).<br><br>The sent bytes are swapped 2 by 2 on the slave device. | [ModbusWriteFloat](../WDLang3/1000025933.md)<br>[ModbusReadFloat](../WDLang3/1000025936.md) |
| **modbusDCBA** | Mode for storing float values on the slave device. Bytes are identified from A to D. A is the most significant byte and D is the least significant byte (IEEE-754 standard).<br><br>The sent bytes are swapped on the slave device. | [ModbusWriteFloat](../WDLang3/1000025933.md)<br>[ModbusReadFloat](../WDLang3/1000025936.md) |
