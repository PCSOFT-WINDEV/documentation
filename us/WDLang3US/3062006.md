<a name="description"></a>
Runs different functions that directly affect the bits of serial port, parallel port or infrared port, independently of the communication protocol. These functions are used to manage:

- the DTR signal,

- the RTS signal,

- the XOFF and XON characters.




**Remarks**: 

- The port must be opened beforehand ([sOpen](../WDLang3/3062013.md)).

- ![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png)![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Infrared ports are not supported.

sEscape(PortNum, "CLRDTR")
```

## Syntax

`<Result> = sEscape(<Port number> , <Function>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the function was run,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. If the port was not opened beforehand (by [sOpen](../WDLang3/3062013.md)), **sEscape** has no effect.




**`<Port number>: (Integer)`**

Identifier of the port used: 

- Port number: 

	- Number of the serial port: 1, 2, 3, ... 32 for COM1, COM2, COM3, ... COM32.

	- Number of the parallel port: -1, -2, -3 or -4 for LPT1, LPT2, LPT3 or LPT4.

	- Number of the infrared port: 1, 2, 3, ... 32 for IR1, IR2, IR3, ... IR32.




- Port identifier returned by [sOpen](../WDLang3/3062013.md) (if this function was called with a port name). 
	![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) Only this type of parameter is available.




**`<Function>: (Character string)`**

Function to run:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| CLRBREAK | Clears the "Break line" signal.<br><br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This function is not supported. |
| CLRDTR | Clears the DTR signal. |
| CLRRTS | Clears the RTS signal. |
| RESETDEV | Re-initializes the device if possible.<br><br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This function is not supported. |
| SETBREAK | Enables the "Break Line" signal.<br><br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This function is not supported. |
| SETDTR | Sends the DTR signal. |
| SETRTS | Sends the RTS signal. |
| SETXOFF | The transmission behaves like if the XOFF character was received.<br><br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This function is not supported. |
| SETXON | The transmission behaves like if the XON character was received.<br><br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This function is not supported. |








## Remarks
![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) **Special case for Linux**: 

- Only serial ports can be opened and initialized. 

- By default, users do not have access to serial ports. It is necessary to grant them specific rights to manage serial ports.

### Using an external library: RXTX
<a name="using_external_library_rxtx_ELTPARAGRAPHE000328"></a>

In Java, the use of functions for handling the serial and parallel ports ([sOpen](../WDLang3/3062013.md), [sWrite](../WDLang3/3062009.md), [sRead](../WDLang3/3062012.md), ...) requires the presence of an external library: RXTX. 

This library includes a Jar archive and one or more native libraries that depend on the operating system on which the application is run.
 
To use these functions: 

- the Jar archive (RXTXComm.jar) must: 

	- be found in the same directory as the Java application generated by WINDEV, 

	- be found in the execution classpath of the application, 

	- be directly included in the generated application (from the wizard for Java generation). 




- the native libraries corresponding to the operating system on which the application is run must be found: 

	- in the same directory as the Java application generated by WINDEV, 

	- in the path of the application libraries (librarypath).







The RXTX library and its documentation can be downloaded from: [http://users.frii.com/jarvi/rxtx/index.html](http://users.frii.com/jarvi/rxtx/index.html) (link valid at the time this documentation was published). 

**Caution**: The management of infrared ports is not available in Java.
