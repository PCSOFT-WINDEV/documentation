	To install the final SOAP server, this file is found in the setup directory of your application.

	Remark: If the ".soap" extension is already associated with a module on your server, use a different extension. In this case, this new extension must be specified in the functions used to specify the URL of the SOAP server (&lt;URL of SOAP server&gt; in [SOAPRun](../WDLang3/3069013.md), for example).
