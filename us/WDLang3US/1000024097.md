## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Chart control>.Scatter3DAddData(<Series number> , <X value> , <Y value> , <Z value> [, <Color> [, <Type>]])`
---

**`<Chart control>: (Control name)`**

Name of the Chart control to use (in the window editor).

**`<Series number>: (Integer)`**

Number of the series into which a value will be added. If the specified series does not exist, the chart designer creates as many series as necessary in order to get a consistent matrix. All the created series are initialized to 0.

**`<X value>: (Real)`**

Horizontal coordinate (X-coordinate) of the point to add.

**`<Y value>: (Real)`**

Vertical coordinate (Y-coordinate) of the point to add.

**`<Z value>: (Real)`**

Coordinate in altitude of the point to add.

**`<Color>: (Integer or Integer constant)`**

Point color. This color can correspond to:

- an RGB color (returned by [RGB](../WDLang1/3029012.md)),

- an HSL color (returned by [HSL](../WDLang1/3029057.md)),

- [a preset color](../WDLang5/3010002.md).

- the *ColorUndefined* constant (default value) to apply the series color.




**`<Type>: (Optional Integer constant)`**

Type of point:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *grPointCircle* | Point shaped like a circle. |
| *grPointCross* | Point shaped like a cross. |
| *grPointCube* | Point shaped like a cube (3D). |
| *grPointDiamond* | Point shaped like a diamond. |
| *grPointPyramid* | Point shaped like a pyramid (3D). |
| *grPointSphere* | Point shaped like a sphere (3D). |
| *grPointSquare* | Point shaped like a square. |
| *grPointTriangle* | Point shaped like a triangle. |


If this parameter is not specified, the type of point corresponds to the type of point defined for the series.
