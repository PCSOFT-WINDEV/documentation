![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) 
### Enabling the notification mechanism (in a mobile)

`GPSFollowMovement(<WLanguage procedure> [, <Timeout> [, <Distance>]])`
---

**`<WLanguage procedure>: (Procedure name)`**

Name of WLanguage procedure called at each notification.

This procedure has the following format:


```txt
PROCEDURE <Procedure name>(<Location>)
```
&lt;Location&gt; is a variable of type [geoPosition](../WDLang3/1000019191.md) that contains information about the device's location at the time of the notification.

**`<Timeout>: (Optional integer or optional Duration)`**

Minimum timeout (in hundredths of a second) between two notifications. If this parameter is not specified, the minimum timeout will be set to 60 seconds.
Remark: This parameter can be: 

- an integer corresponding to the number of hundredths of a second,

- a Duration variable,

- the duration in a readable format (e.g., 1 s or 10 ms).




![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) This parameter is ignored.

**`<Distance>: (Optional real)`**

Minimum distance (in meters) between two notifications.

If this parameter is not specified, the minimum distance will be set to 5 meters.

### Retrieved properties
<a name="retrieved_properties_ELTPARAGRAPHE000165"></a>

- To determine if a value was assigned to the [Speed](../WDLang3/1000019191.md), [Accuracy](../WDLang3/1000019191.md), [Direction](../WDLang3/1000019191.md) or [Altitude](../WDLang3/1000019191.md) properties of a [geoPosition](../WDLang3/1000019191.md) variable when the location was retrieved, use the [SpeedValid](../WDLang3/1000019191.md), [AccuracyValid](../WDLang3/1000019191.md), [DirectionValid](../WDLang3/1000019191.md) and [AltitudeValid](../WDLang3/1000019191.md) properties.

- To reinitialize a geoPosition variable, use [VariableReset](../WDLang1/3013069.md).

- The positioning information that was retrieved corresponds to the last known device location: therefore, they may not correspond to the current device location if the device was moved while the GPS signal was not valid for example. You can use the [MeasurementDate](../WDLang3/1000019191.md) property of the [geoPosition](../WDLang3/1000019191.md) variable to determine the date and time at which the position was calculated.

- [Speed](../WDLang3/1000019191.md), [Accuracy](../WDLang3/1000019191.md), [Direction](../WDLang3/1000019191.md) and [Altitude](../WDLang3/1000019191.md) will be specified only if the location provider allows it (otherwise, these properties will take their default value).

### Notes
<a name="notes_ELTPARAGRAPHE000235"></a>

- Geolocation functions can consume a lot of resources on the device (battery, bandwidth, etc.). Therefore, we advise you not de define very small values for the minimum time-out and for the minimum distance between two notifications.

- To stop receiving notifications, call **GPSFollowMovement** without parameter or call [GPSEnd](../WDLang3/1000019210.md).

### Required application feature
<a name="required_application_feature_ELTPARAGRAPHE000531"></a>

When this function is used, an application feature is declared in the application generation wizard.

Required feature: Geolocation

This feature allows the applications to access the geolocation features found on the device or on the computer. 

Caution: Android 12 specific case: To execute the procedure called by **GPSFollowMovement** when the application is in the background, it is necessary to run a persistent thread ([ThreadPersistent](../WDLang1/1000020584.md)).
