## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000207"></a>
WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile propose several WLanguage functions allowing you to compress and merge your files into **archives**.

An archive is a physical file:

- whose type is ".WDZ" for a WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile archive.

- whose type is ".ZIP" for a WinZip or PKZip archive.

- whose type is ".CAB" for a "Cabinet Files" archive.

- whose type is ".RAR". 

- whose type is ".7z".

- whose type is ".tar" or ".tgz" (".tar.gz").




This file groups all types of files (".pdf", ".fic", ".mmo", ...) automatically compressed.

For example, the archives allow you to:

- save your files on a regular basis while reducing the storage space, 

- simplify the transmission of your files on Internet/Intranet, 

- create self-extracting archives, 

- ...




An optimized compression allows your files to occupy less disk space and be easily transmitted on different media (CD, Internet, etc.).

Two types of archives are available:

- [single-part archive](../WDLang3/3082015.md): the archive includes a single file.

- [multi-part archive](../WDLang3/3082015.md): the archive includes several files (or sub-archives).

## Handling the archives
<a name="handling_the_archives_ELTTEXTE000231"></a>
To manage your archives, WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile propose several [WLanguage functions](../WDLang3/3082006.md). These functions are used to:

- handle the archives: [creation](../WDLang3/3082003.md), [opening](../WDLang3/3082044.md), [closing](../WDLang3/3082005.md).

- handle the files found in the archive: add and compress files (single file or set of files in a directory), extract and decompress a file, delete files from an archive.

- get various [information](../WDLang3/3082040.md) about the archives and about the compressed files: size before and after compression, ...

- [split](../WDLang3/3082020.md) and/or [merge](../WDLang3/3082046.md) archive volumes.

- create [self-extracting archives](../WDLang3/3082013.md).

### Type of archives
<a name="type_archives_ELTPARAGRAPHE000126"></a>

- The ".WDZ" archives are available in WINDEV (32-bit and 64-bit executable) and WEBDEV.

- The ".ZIP" archives (WinZip or PKZip) are available in WINDEV (32-bit and 64-bit executable), WEBDEV, WINDEV Mobile, Java and Linux.

- The ".CAB" archives ("Cabinet files") are available in WINDEV (32-bit executable only) and WEBDEV.

- The ".RAR" archives are available in WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile.
	remark: RAR archives are supported up to and including version 4. 

- The ".7z" archives are available in WINDEV (32-bit and 64-bit executable) and WEBDEV.

- The ".tar" or ".tgz" archives (".tar.gz") are available in WINDEV (32-bit executable only) and WEBDEV.




Remarks:

- The size of the ".WDZ" archives cannot exceed 4 GB.

- The archives in".CAB" format are necessarily single-part archives.

## Examples
<a name="examples_ELTTEXTE000261"></a>
To save the database of your customer, your program creates a backup archive. The files to save are compressed into the archive.

The archive is then split into several parts. 

				
To simplify the use of backup files: create a self-extracting archive. Simply run the archive to automatically decompress all the files.

This feature can be very useful to manage the automatic backups. Furthermore, the example allows you to create multi-volume archives.
