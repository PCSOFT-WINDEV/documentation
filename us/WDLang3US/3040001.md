## Syntax

`<Result> = FTPMakeDir(<Connection identifier> , <Directory to create>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the directory was created,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) with the *errMessage* constant.




**`<Connection identifier>: (Integer)`**

Connection identifier, returned by [FTPConnect](../WDLang3/3040016.md).



**`<Directory to create>: (Character string)`**

Name and (full or relative) path of directory to create. The different path sections are separated by "slashes" ("/"). The directories are created recursively: there is no need to create the different levels of directories one by one.

## Remarks


### Timeout
<a name="timeout_ELTPARAGRAPHE000083"></a>

By default, all the FTP functions fail if the FTP server does not respond within 20 seconds. This timeout can be modified with [FTPConnect](../WDLang3/3040016.md) when connecting to the FTP server.

<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Rights of users
<a name="rights_users_ELTPARAGRAPHE000111"></a>

Only a user who has write rights on the FTP server can handle the files or the directories found on an FTP server. In most cases, no write rights are granted to the "anonymous" users.

### Relative and absolute path
<a name="relative_and_absolute_path_ELTPARAGRAPHE000118"></a>

The notions of relative path and absolute path are very important in an FTP application.

- A path starting with a slash is considered as being an **absolute path**: it is the path in relation to the root of the FTP server (parameter specific to the server).
	ex: /ad/user/JULIA

- A path not starting with a slash is considered as being a **relative path**, which means a path given in relation to the current directory. This current directory can be returned or modified by [FTPCurrentDir](../WDLang3/3040003.md).


When connecting to an FTP site, the initial directory (the "home directory" of the user) is not necessarily found at the root of the FTP server. Therefore, we recommend that you use relative paths.
