Adds data in a time chart. A time chart is a chart in which the unit of the X-axis is time (date, time, duration). 

This time scale can be used, for example, to represent a change in a measurement (temperature sensor for example) over a day.

## Example


```wl
nSeries is int = 1
rTemperature is array of 24*60 real

FOR i = 1 TO 24*60 // 24h * 60 mn
	d is Duration
	d.Minute = I
	CHART_TemperatureSensor.AddTimeData(nSeries, d, rTemperature[i])
END

CHART_TemperatureSensor.Draw()
```

```wl
// Sinusoidal drawing
FOR i = 1 TO 360
	d is Duration
	d.Minute = I
	CHART_Sin.AddTimeData(1, d, 2 + Sin(i))
END

CHART_Sin.Draw()
```

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Chart control>.AddTimeData(<Series number> , <Time> , <Value>)`
---

**`<Chart control>: (Control name)`**

Name of the Chart control to be used.

**`<Series number>: (Integer)`**

Number of the series into which a value will be added. If the specified series does not exist, the chart designer creates as many series as necessary in order to get a consistent matrix. All the created series are initialized to 0.

**`<Time>: (Duration or DateTime or Date or Time)`**

Position in time for which the value will be added.

**`<Value>: (Integer or real)`**

Value to add. 
If a value is already present for a position in time, this value will be replaced with the new value.

## Remarks
This function allows you to add data to charts that use a time scale and also to real-time charts. For more details, see [Real-time chart](../WDChamp/1000021037.md).
