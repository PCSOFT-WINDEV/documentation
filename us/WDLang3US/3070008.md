## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000183"></a>
WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile include several functions allowing you to perform an advanced management of sockets.

A socket is a communication resource used by applications to communicate from one computer to another regardless of the type of network.

This communication mode can be used, for example, to establish a communication between computers connected by Internet.



WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile allow you to manage:

- The standard sockets.

- The UDP sockets.

- The sockets by infrared.

- SSL sockets.




Examples for using sockets:

- manage a messaging in real-time.

- access to a news server (forum).

## Different modes
<a name="different_modes_ELTTEXTE000207"></a>
A WINDEV or WEBDEV application can manage the sockets according to different modes:

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) [Client WINDEV/WEBDEV application](../WDLang3/3070017.md): the application connects to any server and exchanges data via a socket.

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) [WINDEV "Simplified server" application](../WDLang3/3070001.md): the WINDEV application is a server, exchanging information via a socket with **a single client computer** (WINDEV socket recommended on the client computer but not mandatory).

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) [WINDEV "Standard server" application](../WDLang3/3070003.md): the WINDEV application is a server, exchanging information via sockets with **several client computers**.

## Modifying the standard behavior of sockets
<a name="modifying_the_standard_behavior_sockets_ELTTEXTE000231"></a>


### Optimizing the network frames
<a name="optimizing_the_network_frames_ELTPARAGRAPHE000078"></a>

By default, in Windows, the network frames are optimized according to the Nagle algorithm.

To communicate with a system that does not support this optimization (some embedded industrial operating systems for example), this optimization must be disabled.

To do so, enter the following code:


```wl
Socket.Option = SocketNagleOff
```

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) 

### Optimizing the connections for an IP address
<a name="optimizing_the_connections_for_address_ELTPARAGRAPHE000093"></a>

When an IP address is passed to [SocketConnect](../WDLang3/3070016.md), you have the ability to optimize the connection by using the following code:  


```wl
Socket.Option = SocketOptimizeIPConnection
```


This option is not enabled by default because the connection may fail in some configurations. However, it may be useful in some applications for which the performances are critical.
<a name="NOTE3_3"></a>


### Re-using an address that is already used
<a name="reusing_address_that_already_used_ELTPARAGRAPHE000109"></a>

By default, [SocketCreate](../WDLang3/3070011.md)  allows you to reuse an address (already used by the application itself or by another application). To forbid this operating mode, type the following line of code:


```wl
Socket.Option = SocketNoReuseAddress
```


**Remark**: By extension, this option allows you to find out whether an address or a port is already used. In this case, [SocketCreate](../WDLang3/3070011.md) returns an error.

### Using the default settings
<a name="using_the_default_settings_ELTPARAGRAPHE000128"></a>

The following code allows you to restore the default setting:


```wl
Socket.Option = SocketOptionDefault
```

To use this example, a list of contacts must be entered in your address book. The contacts must be identified by a name and the IP address of their computer. When the application is started, the program searches for the accessible contacts (which means the ones who have started this application on their computer). When you double-click a "connected" contact, a discussion window is opened, giving you the ability to communicate with the contact

To use this example, a first instance of the example must be started in "server" mode. Then, by specifying the name of the computer that will be used as server and a nickname, you can connect to this application in "client" mode. You now have the ability to send messages to all the connected users. In this example, a thread and a socket are associated with each connection.
