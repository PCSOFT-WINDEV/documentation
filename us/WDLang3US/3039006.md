## Remarks


### Procedure for stream detection
<a name="procedure_for_stream_detection_ELTPARAGRAPHE000152"></a>

A stream is associated with the event "Connection request of new stream". This event is run when a request to connect to an incoming stream is detected.

This event is run in one of the following cases: 

- if the [Detection](../Proprietes/2510031.md) property applied to the stream is set to <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>.

- if the option "Detection of active incoming streams" has been checked in the stream description window.




**Remark**: This event is run in a specific thread of WLanguage. Therefore, it is subject to limitations specific to the threads. For more details on threads, see [Managing threads with WINDEV](../WDLang1/3077026.md).
