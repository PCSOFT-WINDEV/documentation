## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000102"></a>
A "beacon" is a hardware transmitter that can "dialog" on a small perimeter with smartphones or tablets via a Bluetooth connection. The technology used is the one of BTLE (Bluetooth Low Energy).

The Beacon can for example indicate the proximity of an art masterpiece in a museum; the application can display the explanation text, or it can start a video or an audio file.

On the commercial side, a Beacon can trigger a message regarding a bargain on a nearby product. A Beacon can also inform a user that he is not far away from a store that sells a product he is looking for.

## Principle
<a name="principle_ELTTEXTE000126"></a>
An application asks the phone to be warned when one or more Beacons are found nearby. This application can be closed immediately, therefore it consumes no battery.

When the phone detects a Beacon, it restarts the application and transmits the Beacon information.

Furthermore, the phone warns the application when it exits from the emission area of Beacon.

## Implementation
<a name="implementation_ELTTEXTE000150"></a>
Several WLanguage functions and 2 specific types can be used to manage Beacons. 



Depending on the use mode of your application, you have the ability to use one of the following methods: 

- **Method 1: Automatic detection of Beacons**
	This method consists in detecting groups of Beacons in the background with [BeaconDetectBackground](../WDLang3/1000023112.md). A specific action is performed when a group of Beacons is detected. Example: 
	
	```wl
	// In a museum, we want to trigger the reading (resp. the stop) of an audio guide 
	// when the visitor enters into (resp. exits from) a room. 
	// Each Beacon is associated with the same UUID corresponding to the museum and 
	// a Major number corresponding to the room in which the beacon will be positioned. 
	// A Beacon is placed at each entrance to each room of the museum.. 
	// The application must call the BeaconDetectBackground function 
	// with an array of BeaconGroup variables corresponding to each museum room. 
	
	// The callback procedure passed as parameter to the function will be called
	// whenever entering into or exiting from a room and it will give information 
	// about the detected groupe of beacons in order to
	// emulate the audio-guide to play the corresponding track.
	
	// Museum UUID
	sUUID is string = "f4231ab6-5ef2-6c99-4229-af6c72e0446e"
	// Create a beaconGroup variable for each room
	groupRoom1 is beaconGroup
	groupRoom1.UUID = sUUID
	groupRoom1.Major = 1
	groupRoom2 is beaconGroup
	groupRoom2.UUID = sUUID
	groupRoom2.Major = 2
	groupRoom3 is beaconGroup
	groupRoom3.UUID = sUUID
	groupRoom3.Major = 3
	groupRoom4 is beaconGroup
	groupRoom4.UUID = sUUID
	groupRoom4.Major = 4
	// Start the detection
	arrBeaconGroup is array of beaconGroup = [groupRoom1, ...
	    groupRoom2, groupRoom3, groupRoom4)
	// The ProcDetection procedure will be run whenever the mobile enters into 
	// or exits from the area defined by each group of beacons. 
	BeaconDetectBackground(arrBeaconGroup, ProcDetection)
	```

	```wl
	PROCEDURE ProcDetection(Group is beaconGroup, nType is int)
	
	IF nType = bdbLeave THEN 
		// Stop the current track
		RETURN
	END
		
	IF nType = bdbEnter THEN	
		SWITCH Group.Major
			CASE 1
			// Read the track for room 1
			CASE 2
			// Read the track for room 2
			...
		END
	END
	```


- **Method 2: Precise detection of Beacons**
	This method consists in using the precise detection ([BeaconDetectPrecise](../WDLang3/1000023115.md)) to get the nearest Beacon and perform a specific operation. Example: 
	
	```wl
	// In a museum, we want to display on the visitor device the information 
	// regarding the masterpiece he is looking at. Associate to each Beacon 
	// the same UUID corresponding to the museum as well as Major and Minor numbers 
	// allowing each Beacon to be uniquely identified. 
	// A Beacon is placed next to each work of art in the museum. 
	// The application must call the BeaconDetectPrecise function with a 
	// BeaconGroup variable corresponding to the museum tags. 
	// The callback procedure passed as parameter to the function will be called whenever 
	// a new list of Beacons is detected. Then, all you have to do is find 
	// the nearest Beacon to identify the work the visitor is looking at and to display 
	// the corresponding information in the application.
	
	// Museum UUID
	sUUID is string = "f4231ab6-5ef2-6c99-4229-af6c72e0446e"
	// Create a beaconGroup variable corresponding to the museum tags
	groupMuseum is beaconGroup
	groupMuseum.UUID = sUUID
	// Start the detection
	BeaconDetectPrecise(groupMuseum, ProcDetection)
	INTERNAL PROCEDURE ProcDetection(arrInfo is array of beaconDetectionInfo)
		nMinDistance is int 
		NearestBeacon is beaconDetectionInfo	
		FOR EACH Information of arrInfo
			IF nMinDistance = 0 _OR_ Information.Distance < nMinDistance
				NearestBeacon = Information
			END
		END
		// Display information about the masterpiece associated with the tag
		DisplayMasterpieceInfo(NearestBeacon.Major, NearestBeacon.Minor)
	END
	```
