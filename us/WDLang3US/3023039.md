### Disrupted communication in FTP and HTTP
<a name="disrupted_communication_ftp_and_http_ELTPARAGRAPHE000209"></a>

The WINDEV application may be locked if the communication is disrupted: you must switch off and restart the Pocket PC in order to reinitialize the communication layer of Windows Mobile.

To display a message indicating the problem and the possible solution, the process to monitor should be included in a thread (the FTP transfer for exmaple). This thread will be monitored on a regular basis. If a problem occurs, you will have the ability to display a message in plain words (for example "A network failure occurred. Some applications may not operate properly. We advise you to restart your Mobile").
