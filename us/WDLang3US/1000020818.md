Specifies the WLanguage procedure called when a push notification is received by a WINDEV Mobile application (Android or iOS).

**`<WLanguage procedure>: (Procedure name)`**

Name of the procedure that will be called when a push notification is received. This procedure must be a global procedure of application in the following format: 


```txt
PROCEDURE <Procedure name>(<Notification> is Notification)
```

### Behavior when a notification is received
<a name="behavior_when_notification_received_ELTPARAGRAPHE000047"></a>

The behavior when a notification is received is as follows:

1. **If the application is closed**, the system displays the notification in the notification bar. The user can choose to validate the notification. If he does, the application is started. 
	
	Two cases may occur once the application is started:

	- If **NotifPushProcedure** was called in the project initialization code, the global procedure passed to this function as parameter is called, and the first window of the application is not opened. 
			Remark: [OpenMobileWindow](../WDLang1/1000021018.md) must be called in the procedure. 

	- If **NotifPushProcedure** has not been called, the first window of the application is opened.  




2. **If the application is already started**:







Remarks:

- The *exeLaunch* constant of [ExeInfo](../WDLang1/3035001.md) allows you to know if the application was automatically started by the system further to the reception of a push notification: 
	
	```wl
	ExeInfo(exeLaunch) = exePushNotification
	```


- [WinStatus](../WDLang1/3038030.md) allows you to test (if necessary ) the existence of a window in order to open it: 
	
	```wl
	// Summary: Procedure called when clicking on a PUSH notification
	PROCEDURE onPush(MyNotif is Notification)
	
	IF WinStatus("WIN_Main") = NotFound THEN
		// WIN_Main is already open or displayed
		ReceivePushNotif(myNotif, True)
	ELSE
		// Open home window
		OpenMobileWindow(WIN_Main, MyNotif)
	END
	```
