## Example


```wl
IF EmailCheckAddress("morgan@test.com", emailValidateSyntax) <> emailAddressValid THEN
	Error("Please check the email address") 
END
```
<a name="Example2"></a>

```wl
SWITCH EmailCheckAddress("azerty@orange.com")
	CASE emailAddressValid
		Info("Valid address")
	CASE emailAddressIncorrectSyntax
		Info("The syntax of the address is incorrect.")
	CASE emailAddressRefused
		Info("The address was refused by the email server." + ...
			"ErrorInfo returns the reason for the refusal.")
	CASE emailAddressError
		Info("An error occurred during the check. " + ...
			"ErrorInfo returns the details of the error.")	
	OTHER CASE
		Info("Undefined case") 
END

## Syntax

`<Result> = EmailCheckAddress(<Address> [, <Validation level>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer constant)`**

Constant used to find out whether the address passed as parameter is valid:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *emailAddressError* | An error occurred during the check. [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) returns the details of the error. |
| *emailAddressIncorrectSyntax* | The syntax of address is incorrect. |
| *emailAddressRefused* | The address was refused by the email server. [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) returns the reason for the refusal. |
| *emailAddressValid* | The address is valid. This address can be used by [EmailSendMessage](../WDLang3/3032005.md). |

Remark: A timeout may be required according the response time of the server.

**`<Address>: (Character string)`**

Email address to check.

**`<Validation level>: (Optional integer constant)`**

Desired type of validation. You have the ability to use one of the following constants:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *emailValidateByServer* | Checks whether the SMTP email server of the domain to which the address belongs accepts the address in input. The syntax of the email address is automatically checked (*emailValidateSyntax* constant).<br> |
| *emailValidateSyntax*<br>(Default value) | Checks the syntax of the email address. The TLD (Top Level Domain) is not checked. |
| *emailValidateSyntaxStrict* | Checks the syntax of the email address as well as the TLD (Top Level Domain) in relation to the list of existing TLDs (see Notes).<br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This constant is not available. |

## Remarks


### Email address to check
<a name="email_address_check_ELTPARAGRAPHE000110"></a>

- Although email addresses with the format "@[domain name].tld" have a valid syntax according to the RFC822 standard, they are not supported by **EmailCheckAddress**.

- If the &lt;Validation level&gt; corresponds to the *emailValidateSyntax* constant, the email address can contain an empty TLD ("doe@domain." for example).

- If the &lt;Validation level&gt; corresponds to the *emailValidateByServer* or *emailValidateSyntaxStrict* constant, the email address cannot contain any empty TLD ("vince@domain." for example). In this case, &lt;Result&gt; corresponds to *emailAddressIncorrectSyntax*.



<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Validation by server: Necessary conditions
<a name="validation_server_necessary_conditions_ELTPARAGRAPHE000127"></a>

To use the validation by server (*emailValidateByServer* constant), the application must be able to contact:

- a DNS server (by UDP on port 53),

- the email server of the domain to which the address to check belongs (by TCP, port 25).




Therefore, the firewalls may have to be configured specifically.  

**Caution**: In some cases, an email server may accept a non-existing address (when the server is a relay server that cannot access the list of accounts of the domain for which the emails are collected). In this case, &lt;Result&gt; will correspond to the *emailAddressValid* constant even if the address does not exist. Furthermore, the time for retrieving the sever response can be quite long.

**Remark**: The interrogated SMTP email server is found by the MX record (Mail Exchanger) of the domain of the email address.

### List of TLDs used during a string syntactic validation
<a name="list_tlds_used_during_string_syntactic_validation_ELTPARAGRAPHE000143"></a>

When performing a strict syntactic check (*emailValidateSyntaxStrict* constant), a list of international and national TLDs is used. 

The list of TLDs was updated with the official IANA list (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) dated May 2021. 
Remark: The available TLDs may have changed since this update.
