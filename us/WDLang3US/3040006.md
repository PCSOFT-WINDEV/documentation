## Syntax

### Identifying the attributes of last consulted file

`<Result> = FTPAttribute()`
---

**`<Result>: (Character string)`**



- "ERR" if an error occurred. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) with the *errMessage* constant.

- One or more letters corresponding to the file attributes ("AH" for example). The following letters are used:

	- R: Read-only file. The file can be accessed in read-only.

	- H: Hidden file. The file name is grayed or invisible in the explorer.
			![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This option is not available.

	- S: System file. The file is a Windows system file.
			![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This option is not available.

	- A: "Archive" file. This attribute indicates that the file can be archived. Some programs use this attribute to determine which files have been saved.
			![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This option is not available.

	- D: Directory or subdirectory. The file is a directory or a subdirectory.

	- C: Compressed file (on the NTFS partitions). This file was automatically compressed during its copy on an NTFS partition (Windows NT or 2000).
			![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This option is not available.







This syntax returns the attributes of the last file accessed by one of the following FTP functions: [FTPDate](../WDLang3/3040015.md), [FTPTime](../WDLang3/3040013.md), [FTPSize](../WDLang3/3040007.md), [FTPListFile](../WDLang3/3040018.md). Unlike the syntax 2, no request is sent to the server. This syntax is recommended.

**`<Connection identifier>: (Integer)`**

Connection identifier, returned by [FTPConnect](../WDLang3/3040016.md).



**`<File name>: (Character string)`**

Name and full (or relative) path of the file be accessed. The different path sections are separated by "slashes" ("/").

## Remarks




### Identifying the files attributes
<a name="identifying_the_files_attributes_ELTPARAGRAPHE000141"></a>

To retrieve the different attributes of a file, check whether one of the letters identifying an attribute is found in &lt;Result&gt;. This search can be performed by [Position](../WDLang1/3024027.md) for example.
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>




### Timeout
<a name="timeout_ELTPARAGRAPHE000152"></a>

By default, all the FTP functions fail if the FTP server does not respond within 20 seconds. This timeout can be modified with [FTPConnect](../WDLang3/3040016.md) when connecting to the FTP server.
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>




### Rights of users
<a name="rights_users_ELTPARAGRAPHE000181"></a>

Only a user who has read rights on the FTP server can identify the attributes of the files or directories found on an FTP server. In most cases, read rights are granted to the "anonymous" users, giving them the ability to identify the attributes of a file or directory found on an FTP server.
<a name="NOTE0_5"></a>




### Relative and absolute path
<a name="relative_and_absolute_path_ELTPARAGRAPHE000189"></a>

The notions of relative path and absolute path are very important in an FTP application.

- A path starting with a slash is considered as being an **absolute path**: it is the path in relation to the root of the FTP server (parameter specific to the server).
	ex: /ad/user/JULIA

- A path not starting with a slash is considered as being a **relative path**, which means a path given in relation to the current directory. This current directory can be returned or modified by [FTPCurrentDir](../WDLang3/3040003.md).




When connecting to an FTP site, the initial directory (the "home directory" of the user) is not necessarily found at the root of the FTP server. Therefore, we recommend that you use relative paths.
