Used to establish a secure connection to an SSL server.

## Example


```wl
IF SocketConnectSSL("Server", 8000, "150.134.20") = False THEN
	Error("Connection error" + ErrorInfo(errMessage))
END
```

## Syntax

`<Result> = SocketConnectSSL(<Socket name> , <Port number> , <Address> [, <SSL option> [, <Maximum timeout> [, <Client certificate>]]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the connection was established,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. If an error occurs, you can get more details on the error with [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md).




**`<Socket name>: (Character string)`**

Name that will be given to the connection opened on the server socket. This name will be used by all socket functions.

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Caution: the socket name is case sensitive.

**`<Port number>: (Integer)`**

Port number of the socket. If you are using a socket associated with a preset protocol, use the port number associated with the protocol.
If the socket was created by a WINDEV application, this number must be included between 5 000 and 65 000. In this case, the number must be identical to the port number specified in [SocketCreateSSL](../WDLang3/1000017041.md).

**`<Address>: (Character string)`**

Server address. If this parameter is not specified, the server is sought on the current computer. This address can be given in the following format:

- IP address in XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX format (125.5.110.100 for example).

- URL containing the server name (www.windev.com for example). This syntax is recommended.




![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) The address can also correspond to the IP address returned by [NetIPAddress](../WDLang3/3056023.md).

**`<SSL option>: (Optional combination of integer constants)`**

Used to choose the protocol and the identification mode: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *ProtocolSSL2* | SSL2 protocol<br><br>![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) This protocol is not supported. |
| *ProtocolSSL3* | SSL3 protocol<br><br>![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) This protocol is not supported. |
| *ProtocolTLS1* | TLS1 protocol |
| *ProtocolTLS1_1* | TLS 1.1 protocol |
| *ProtocolTLS1_2* | TLS 1.2 protocol |
| *ProtocolTLS1_3* | TLS 1.3 protocol |


By default, the combination used is: *ProtocolTLS1* + *ProtocolTLS1_1* + *ProtocoleTLS1_2*.

**`<Maximum timeout>: (Optional integer or optional Duration)`**

Maximum timeout (in milliseconds) for establishing the connection. This timeout will be used if the server refuses the connection ([SocketDeny](../WDLang3/3070010.md)). In this case, the connection will not be locking.
This parameter can be: 

- an integer corresponding to the number of milliseconds,

- a Duration variable,

- the duration in a readable format (e.g., 1 s or 10 ms). 


This wait is equal to 10 milliseconds by default.

**`<Client certificate>: (Certificate variable)`**

Name of the [Certificate](../WDLang1/1000019287.md) variable allowing the server to authenticate the client that wants to connect and to check whether this client is allowed to access the server. This certificate must be recognized on the server. 
![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) This parameter is not available.

## Remarks


### Optimizing the connections for an IP address
<a name="optimizing_the_connections_for_address_ELTPARAGRAPHE000160"></a>

When an IP address is passed to **SocketConnectSSL**, the connection can be optimized by using the following code:  


```wl
Socket.Option = SocketOptimizeIPConnection
```


This option is not enabled by default because the connection may fail in some configurations. However, it may be useful in some applications for which the performance is critical.

**Remark**: To restore the default behavior, simply use the *SocketOptionDefault* constant:


```wl
Socket.Option = SocketOptionDefault
```

### Timeout
<a name="timeout_ELTPARAGRAPHE000177"></a>

The timeout specified by &lt;Maximum timeout&gt; groups the timeout of two steps:

- the timeout for address resolution: this timeout cannot be configured and it can be optimized (see below).

- the maximum timeout for the connection to be accepted by the server. Several cases may occur:

	- the server refuses the connection.

	- the server accepts the connection within the timeout

	- the server is not available.

	- the specified address is invalid.







To optimize the timeout for address resolution (time required to find the address), we advise you to:

- use a DNS on the network. Therefore, this address will be sought toward this server and not for each computer (1 search instead of x searches where x represents the number of computers). Each computer must be registered toward this server.

- for an IP address, use Socket.Option = SocketOptimizeIPConnection.
