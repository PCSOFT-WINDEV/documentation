Writes a character string to the output buffer of the specified serial port, parallel port or infrared port. The end of writing can be checked by [sInExitQueue](../WDLang3/3062005.md).

**Remarks**: 

- The port must be opened beforehand ([sOpen](../WDLang3/3062013.md)).

- ![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Infrared ports are not supported.

- ![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) Only serial ports are supported.

## Example


```wl
// The COM2 port is opened
PortNum = sOpen("COM2", 2000, 2000) // Open COM2
IF PortNum <> 0 THEN
	sMessage is string 
	// Send a message to the output buffer of COM2
	sWrite(PortNum, sMessage)
	// Wait for the end of the write operation
	LOOP
		IF sInExitQueue(2) = 0 THEN BREAK
	END
	Info("End of write operation")
END

### Writing a buffer into the output buffer of a port

`<Result> = sWrite(<Port number> , <Buffer to write>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**



- Number of characters written,

- 0 if timeout is over and if the writing was not performed.




**`<Port number>: (Integer)`**

Identifier of the port used:

- Port number:

	- Number of the serial port: 1, 2, 3, ... 32 for COM1, COM2, COM3, ... COM32.

	- Number of the parallel port: -1, -2, -3 or -4 for LPT1, LPT2, LPT3 or LPT4.

	- Number of the infrared port: 1, 2, 3, ... 32 for IR1, IR2, IR3, ... IR32.
			![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Infrared ports are not supported.




- Port identifier returned by [sOpen](../WDLang3/3062013.md) (if this function was called with a port name). 
	![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) Only this type of parameter is available.




**`<Buffer to write>: (Buffer)`**

Buffer that must be written into the output buffer.

## Remarks




### Miscellaneous
<a name="miscellaneous_ELTPARAGRAPHE000146"></a>

- **[sOpen](../WDLang3/3062013.md)** has no effect if the port was not opened by sWrite.

- A 32-bit application is locked during the duration of the transfer. To avoid this lock, the timeout between two write operations must be specified in [sOpen](../WDLang3/3062013.md). When the timeout is over and if the writing was not performed, **sWrite** returns 0.
	![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) **sWrite** is a blocking function during the transfer even if a timeout was specified in [sOpen](../WDLang3/3062013.md).

- The time required to transfer the string depends on the transmission speed.

- The string or the buffer is automatically transferred.

- WLanguage does not support control signals.

- The time to wait for a character to be read or written is specified with [sOpen](../WDLang3/3062013.md). 

	- If this time is set to 1s when reading 1024 bytes, the waiting time will be 1024s. 

	- If this time is set to "-1s" when reading 1024 bytes, the waiting time will be 1s.


 This prevents lock problems when reading from or writing to the print port.

### Transmission between two computers that use character strings in different formats (UNICODE and ANSI)
<a name="transmission_between_two_computers_that_use_character_strings_different_formats_unicode_and_ansi_ELTPARAGRAPHE000189"></a>

Some conversions are required to perform a transmission between two computers that use different formats of character strings (Windows (ANSI) and Windows Mobile (UNICODE) for example):


|   |   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Format of character strings on the current computer** | **Write operation**<br>(**sWrite** function) | **Read operation**<br>([sRead](../WDLang3/3062012.md)) |
| **String in ANSI format** | **String in UNICODE format** |
| ANSI<br>(PC running Windows for example) | The character string will be in ANSI format | No conversion is required | Conversion required ([UnicodeToAnsi](../WDLang1/3024025.md)) |
| UNICODE | The character string will be in UNICODE format | Conversion required ([AnsiToUnicode](../WDLang1/3024002.md)) | No conversion is required |


![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) **Special case for Linux**: 

- Only serial ports can be opened and initialized. 

- By default, users do not have access to serial ports. It is necessary to grant them specific rights to manage serial ports. 



![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) 

### Using an external library: RXTX
<a name="using_external_library_rxtx_ELTPARAGRAPHE000416"></a>

In Java, the use of functions for handling the serial and parallel ports ([sOpen](../WDLang3/3062013.md), [sWrite](../WDLang3/3062009.md), [sRead](../WDLang3/3062012.md), ...) requires the presence of an external library: RXTX. 

This library includes a Jar archive and one or more native libraries that depend on the operating system on which the application is run.
 
To use these functions: 

- the Jar archive (RXTXComm.jar) must: 

	- be found in the same directory as the Java application generated by WINDEV, 

	- be found in the execution classpath of the application, 

	- be directly included in the generated application (from the wizard for Java generation). 




- the native libraries corresponding to the operating system on which the application is run must be found: 

	- in the same directory as the Java application generated by WINDEV, 

	- in the path of the application libraries (librarypath).







The RXTX library and its documentation can be downloaded from: [http://users.frii.com/jarvi/rxtx/index.html](http://users.frii.com/jarvi/rxtx/index.html) (link valid at the time this documentation was published). 

**Caution**: The management of infrared ports is not available in Java.
