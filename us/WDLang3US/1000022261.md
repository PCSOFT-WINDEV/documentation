**`<Chart name>: (Control name or character string)`**

Name of the chart to be used. This name corresponds to:

- the chart name defined through programming with [grCreate](../WDLang3/3042005.md).

- the name of Chart control (found in the window editor or in the report editor).




**`<Series number>: (Integer)`**

Number of the series for which the opacity must be modified.

**`<Percentage of opacity>: (Integer)`**

## Remarks
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


- The change of opacity is taken into account by all types of charts. 

- The opacity defined for the series has priority over the global opacity defined for the Chart control ([Opacity](../Proprietes/2514006.md)).
