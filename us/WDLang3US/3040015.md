## Syntax

### Getting the different dates of the last file accessed

`<Result> = FTPDate([<Type of date>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Character string)`**



- Date (in YYYYMMDD format) of the last file accessed via one of the following FTP functions: [FTPAttribute](../WDLang3/3040006.md), [FTPTime](../WDLang3/3040013.md), [FTPSize](../WDLang3/3040007.md), [FTPListFile](../WDLang3/3040018.md).

- Empty string ("") if an error occurred. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) with the *errMessage* constant.


![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png)![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Modification date of the last file accessed.**Unlike syntax 2, no request is sent to the server. Therefore, this syntax is recommended whenever possible.**

**`<Type of date>: (Optional constant)`**

Indicates the date to handle:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *ftpAccess* | Date the file was last accessed. |
| *ftpCreation* | Date the file was created. |
| *ftpModification*<br>(Default value) | Date the file was last modified. |

![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png)![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This parameter is not available. Only the date the file was last modified is returned.

---

**`<Result>: (Character string)`**



- Date of the specified file (in YYYYMMDD format),

- Empty string ("") if an error occurred. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) with the *errMessage* constant.




![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png)![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Modification date of the last file accessed.

**`<Connection identifier>: (Integer)`**

Connection identifier, returned by [FTPConnect](../WDLang3/3040016.md).



**`<File name>: (Character string)`**

Name and full (or relative) path of the file be accessed. The different path sections are separated by "slashes" ("/").

| --- | --- |
| *ftpAccess* | Date the file was last accessed. |

## Remarks


### File date
<a name="file_date_ELTPARAGRAPHE000144"></a>

Due to a bug in a Microsoft component, the year returned by **FTPDate** may be invalid for some versions of Internet Explorer 5.0. If the file was created or modified on the same day, the date may be one year earlier than the actual date.
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Timeout
<a name="timeout_ELTPARAGRAPHE000153"></a>

By default, all the FTP functions fail if the FTP server does not respond within 20 seconds. This timeout can be modified with [FTPConnect](../WDLang3/3040016.md) when connecting to the FTP server.
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Rights of users
<a name="rights_users_ELTPARAGRAPHE000181"></a>

Only a user who has read rights on the FTP server can get information about the files or the directories found on an FTP server. In most cases, the read rights are granted to the "anonymous" users.
<a name="NOTE0_5"></a>


### Relative and absolute path
<a name="relative_and_absolute_path_ELTPARAGRAPHE000188"></a>

The notions of relative path and absolute path are very important in an FTP application.

- A path starting with a slash is considered as being an **absolute path**: it is the path in relation to the root of the FTP server (parameter specific to the server).
	ex: /ad/user/JULIA

- A path not starting with a slash is considered as being a **relative path**, which means a path given in relation to the current directory. This current directory can be returned or modified by [FTPCurrentDir](../WDLang3/3040003.md).


When connecting to an FTP site, the initial directory (the "home directory" of the user) is not necessarily found at the root of the FTP server. Therefore, we recommend that you use relative paths.
