## Example


```wl
pos1 is geoPosition
pos1.Latitude = 1.442951
pos1.Longitude = 43.604363

pos2 is geoPosition
pos2.Latitude = 2.505874
pos2.Longitude = 50.458744

InfoBuild("The distance between the two locations is %1 meters.", geoDistance(pos1, pos2))
```

`<Result> = geoDistance(<Location 1> , <Location 2> [, <Unit>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Real)`**

Approximate distance between the two locations. This distance is expressed in the selected unit (in meters by default). 

**`<Location 1>: (geoPosition variable)`**

Name of the [geoPosition](../WDLang3/1000019191.md) variable corresponding to the first location to compare.

**`<Location 2>: (geoPosition variable)`**

Name of the [geoPosition](../WDLang3/1000019191.md) variable corresponding to the second location to compare.

**`<Unit>: (Integer constant)`**

Unit in which the distance must be returned: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *geoKilometer* | Distance in kilometers. |
| *geoMeter* <br>(default value) | Distance in meters. |
| *geoMile* | Distance in international earth miles. |
