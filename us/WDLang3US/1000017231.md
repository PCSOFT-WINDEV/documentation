## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000124"></a>
Create a new type of application! With no contact between the PC and the mobile device, several processes can be run on the PC by using the data found on the mobile device.

For example:

- An application on PC (or mobile device) can emulate services on a device that supports the bluetooth standard.

- An application can automatically retrieve photos from a cell phone.

- An application can read the list of contacts found on a cell phone.

- A PC can print the data found on a PDA.

## How to?

### Several groups of functions allow you to communicate by Bluetooth:
<a name="several_groups_functions_allow_you_communicate_bluetooth_ELTPARAGRAPHE000025"></a>

- [The Bluetooth functions](../WDLang3/1000017173.md) (BTxxx): These functions allow you to manage the Bluetooth devices. You can for example list the services found on a device, and enable or disable them. You can also authenticate toward a Bluetooth device and get various information about the device.

- [The OBEXxxx functions](../WDLang3/1000017175.md): These functions allow you to manage the exchanges of files via the OBEX protocol. The OBEX protocol is a protocol for exchanging data via Infrared and Bluetooth.

- [SocketConnectBluetooth](../WDLang3/1000017145.md) and [SocketCreateBluetooth](../WDLang3/1000017167.md) that allow you to manage the sockets that use the Bluetooth devices.

## Which keys should be used?
<a name="which_keys_should_used_ELTTEXTE000172"></a>
The functions allowing you to handle the Bluetooth keys operate with the keys that use a protocol stack issued by Microsoft or Bluesoleil. To get the stack used, call [BTStack](../WDLang3/1000017229.md).

Some WLanguage functions can only be used with some types of stacks. This information is presented in details in each relevant WLanguage function. 

The following keys use a Microsoft stack (without installing to driver supplied with the keys):

- D-Link DBT-120, 

- Broadcom Bluetooth 2.0 EDR USB, 

- EMTEC Dongle Bluetooth 2.0 EDR - EKCOB110, 

- HAMA Nano Bluetooth Adapter 2.0 EDR - 10m, 

- Conceptronic Dongle Bluetooth 2.0 EDR - CBT200U2A, 

- Kensington Bluetooth USB Micro Adapter (Bluetooth 2.0 - USB 2.0), 

- (\*) Belkin Bluetooth 2.0 Adapter - F8T013FR1 - 10-meter range (USB 2.0), 

- (\*) Belkin Bluetooth 2.0 Adapter - F8T012FR1 - 100-meter range (USB 2.0), 

- TrendNet TBW-104UB - USB Bluetooth 2.0 Adapter, 

- (\*) TrendNet TBW-102UB - Bluetooth Class 2 Adapter (Bluetooth 1.1), ...




This list is not exhaustive and it will be updated on a regular basis.

(\*) Some keys do not directly operate in Windows, a driver must be installed via the following operating mode:

1. if it was installed, uninstall the driver supplied with the key via "Add/Remove programs" found in the Control Panel, 

2. insert the CD supplied with the key in the drive, DO NOT start its automatic execution, 

3. connect the key, 

4. ask Windows to find the driver on the CD.




This method allows you to have a key recognized by Windows and therefore to use a Microsoft stack.
