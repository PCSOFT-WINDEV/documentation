## Remarks


### Saving a chart
<a name="saving_chart_ELTPARAGRAPHE000200"></a>

- To save a chart, the chart must have been drawn beforehand ([&lt;Chart&gt;.Draw](../WDLang3/1000024062.md)). The modifications performed since the last call to [&lt;Chart&gt;.Draw](../WDLang3/1000024062.md) will be ignored.

- The default size of the image is set to 639 x 479. These dimensions are taken into account if the chart was never drawn or if it is not visible.

### Backup in WMF format
<a name="backup_wmf_format_ELTPARAGRAPHE000230"></a>

- This file can be read by a tool that recognizes WMF format.

- The size of the file is identical to the size of the destination (size of window size, control or file).

- We recommend that you preview the chart before it is saved in a file.

### Differences between grDestinationWMF and &lt;Chart&gt;.SaveWMF
<a name="differences_between_grdestinationwmf_and_docparampagetitleshort_ELTPARAGRAPHE000242"></a>

- [grDestinationWMF](../WDLang3/3042019.md) is used to define the destination for the next drawing of the chart. When [&lt;Chart&gt;.Draw](../WDLang3/1000024062.md) is used, the chart will be drawn in the specified file and all the changes made since the chart was last drawn will be taken into account.

- **&lt;Chart&gt;.SaveWMF** is used to save the chart in a file in WMF format. The image saved corresponds to the chart during the last call to [&lt;Chart&gt;.Draw](../WDLang3/1000024062.md). The changes made to the chart since [&lt;Chart&gt;.Draw](../WDLang3/1000024062.md) was last called will be ignored.
