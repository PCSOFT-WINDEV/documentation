Modifies the client certificate used by default to identify oneself on a server. This certificate is used by the SOAP functions and by the HTTP functions as follows. 

During the call to an HTTP function or to a SOAP function, the following steps must be performed if the site asks for a client certification: 

- **If a certificate is fixed**, it is sought. If the certificate exists, it is used. 

- **If a certificate is not fixed or if the fixed certificate was refused by the site**, a window for certificate selection allows you to select the certificate to use.

## Syntax

`HTTPCertificate(<Certificate>)`
---

**`<Certificate>: (Character string)`**

Corresponds to: 

- the name of the certificate to use. If two certificates with the same name are found in the certificate store,  one of them will be chosen at random by the system.

- the thumbprint of the certificate to use. Only the thumbprint can identify a certificate. 


The certificate name (and thumbprint) can be retrieved with [HTTPListCertificate](../WDLang3/1000018890.md). 

If this parameter corresponds to an empty string (""), the default certificate is reinitialized to "&lt;None&gt;". 

**Caution**: **HTTPCertificate** does not check if the certificate exists.
