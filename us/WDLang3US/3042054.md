## Remarks


- If all the chart series are deleted, new data must be added in order to redraw the chart.

- The modifications performed by **grDeleteSeries** will be taken into account during the next call to [grDraw](../WDLang3/3042026.md).

- For a series based on an item, the data is erased. The data source is stored and the data can be rebuilt. To cut the link to the source, use [grSourceSeries](../WDLang3/3042067.md) and modify the source of the series.
