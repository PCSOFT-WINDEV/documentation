`inAppRestorePurchases(<WLanguage procedure>)`
---

**`<WLanguage procedure>: (Procedure name)`**

Name of WLanguage procedure ("callback" procedure) run when a purchase is restored by the store. This procedure has the following format: 

```txt
PROCEDURE <Procedure name>(<Success> is boolean, 
	<Product> is inAppProduct, <Quantity> is int)
```
where: 

- &lt;Success&gt; is boolean: 

	- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the product was restored,

	- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) before any other call to a WLanguage function (this would reinitialize the error).
