### Using the speech synthesis in the application
<a name="using_the_speech_synthesis_the_application_ELTPARAGRAPHE000054"></a>

To use the speech synthesis in the application:

1. Initialize the options for managing the voice synthesis with [SpeechSynthesisInitialize](../WDLang3/1000020171.md). 
	Remark: This function is optional. If the parameters of speech synthesis have not been defined beforehand, the default parameters will be used and the language for text reading will be the first language available for the engine of speech synthesis according to the following sequence:

	- Application language (default language or language defined by [Nation](../WDLang1/3054014.md)), 

	- Language of device,

	- English,

	- Default language of engine for speech synthesis.




3. Start the reading with the following functions: 
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [SpeechSynthesisReadFile](../WDLang3/1000020172.md) | Reads the content of the specified file by using the engine for speech synthesis found on the device. |
| [SpeechSynthesisReadText](../WDLang3/1000019805.md) | Reads the specified text using the device's text-to-speech engine. |




Remarks: 

- If a new read operation is triggered while another read operation is in progress, the new read operation will start once the first one is over. 
	To know whether a read operation is in progress on the speech synthesis engine, use [SpeechSynthesisInProgress](../WDLang3/1000020173.md). 
	To stop the current read operations, use [SpeechSynthesisStop](../WDLang3/1000020174.md).
