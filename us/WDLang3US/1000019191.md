The **geoPosition** type is used to handle geographic positions via WLanguage geolocation functions. A geographic position is defined by a latitude, a longitude and a measurement date. It can also include information on altitude, speed, direction and/or measurement accuracy.

The **geoPosition** type is used to define the advanced characteristics of a geographic position. The characteristics of this position can be defined and changed using different WLanguage properties.

**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

## Example


```wl
pos1 is geoPosition
pos1.Latitude = 1.442951
pos1.Longitude = 43.604363

pos2 is geoPosition
pos2.Latitude = 2.505874
pos2.Longitude = 50.458744

InfoBuild("The distance between the two positions is %1 meters", geoDistance(pos1, pos2))
```

### Properties specific to geoPosition variables
<a name="properties_specific_geoposition_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000073"></a>

The following properties can be used to handle a **geoPosition** variable:

| **Property name** | **Type used** | **Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Accuracy | Real | Accuracy of measurement (in meters).<br><br>This property is specified only when it is supported by the location provider.<br><br>This property was renamed in version 26. "Accuracy" is kept for backward compatibility. |
| AccuracyValid | Boolean | <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the current location contains valid accuracy information.<br><br>**Accuracy** is considered valid in the following cases:<br><br>- it was assigned by programming.<br><br>- it was initialized by the location provider.<br><br><br>**AccuracyValid** is accessible in read-only mode. |
| Altitude | Real | Altitude of the position (in meters).<br><br>This property is specified only when it is supported by the location provider. |
| AltitudeValid | Boolean | <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the current location contains valid altitude information.<br><br>**Altitude** is considered valid in the following cases:<br><br>- it was assigned by programming.<br><br>- it was initialized by the location provider.<br><br><br>**AltitudeValid** is accessible in read-only mode. |
| Direction | Real | Moving direction of the device (in degrees East of true North).<br><br>Remarks: <br><br>- The value of **Direction** is taken into account unless the device moves too slowly.<br><br>- This property is specified only when it is supported by the location provider.<br><br><br> |
| DirectionValid | Boolean | <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the current location contains valid direction information.<br><br>**Direction** is considered valid in the following cases:<br><br>- it was assigned by programming.<br><br>- it was initialized by the location provider.<br><br><br>**DirectionValid** is accessible in read-only mode. |
| Latitude | Real | Latitude of the position (in degrees).<br><br>Possible values range from -90° (South Pole) to +90° (North Pole). |
| Longitude | Real | Longitude of the position (in degrees).<br><br>Possible values range from -180° (West longitude) to +180° (East longitude) relative to the Greenwich Meridian. |
| MeasurementDate | DateTime variable or character string | Date and time of the measurement. This date and this time correspond to the local time on the device. To get the time in UTC format, use [DateTimeLocalToUTC](../WDLang1/3027036.md).<br><br> |
| PositionValid | Boolean | <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the latitude and/or the longitude have been specified for the current location. <br><br>**PositionValid** is accessible in read-only mode. |
| Speed | Real | Ground speed of the moving device (in meters/second). <br><br>This property is specified only when it is supported by the location provider. |
| SpeedValid | Boolean | <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the current location contains valid speed information.<br><br>**Speed** is considered valid in the following cases:<br><br>- it was assigned by programming.<br><br>- it was initialized by the location provider.<br><br><br>**SpeedValid** is accessible in read-only mode. |

|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [geoAzimuth](../WDLang3/1000019212.md) | Returns the direction represented by a location in relation to another one. |
| [geoDistance](../WDLang3/1000019211.md) | Returns the distance between the two locations. This distance is expressed in meters by default. |
| [geoRunApp](../WDLang3/1000019954.md) | Starts the device's native maps application to display: <br><br>- a specific geographical location, <br><br>- a route between two locations.<br><br><br> |
| [GPSGetPosition](../WDLang3/1000019205.md) | Retrieves information about the current device position. |
| [GPSLastPosition](../WDLang3/1000019239.md) | Retrieves the information about the last known device position. |
| [MapGetPosition](../WDLang3/1000019790.md) | Returns the geographical position of the point located in the center of the map currently displayed in a Map control. |
| [MapInfoXY](../WDLang3/1000019950.md) | Returns the geographical position (latitude and longitude) corresponding to a point in a Map control. |
