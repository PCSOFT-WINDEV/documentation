## Syntax

### Extracting a file identified by its index

`<Result> = <Archive>.ExtractFile(<File index> [, <File destination> [, <Progress>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer or buffer)`**



- 0 if the file was extracted,

- An error code (value greater than 0) otherwise. For more details on these error codes, see the Remarks.




When extracting "in memory", corresponds to the buffer containing the extracted file.

**`<Archive>: (zipArchive variable)`**

Name of a variable of type [zipArchive](../WDLang3/1000018679.md) corresponding to the archive to use.

**`<File index>: (Integer)`**

Index of file to extract from the archive.  [SearchFile](../WDLang3/1000026330.md) returns this index.

**`<File destination>: (Optional character string or constant)`**

Destination path of extracted file:

- Optional character string: The file is extracted into the specified path to which is added the stored tree structure of file (the drive is not stored). The specified path is created if it does not exist.
	![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) The destination path of the extracted file must correspond to the working directory of the application (returned by [fDataDir](../WDLang1/3036001.md)) or one of its subdirectories.

- Optional constant:
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *zipDirectory*<br>(Default value) | Extraction into the current directory while restoring the tree structure of file (if it was stored). |
| *zipDrive* | Extraction:<br><br>	- to the initial file location if it was stored and if the drive exists.<br><br>	- while restoring the tree structure of the file on the current drive if the drive or the stored directory does not exist.<br><br>	- into the current directory if only the file name and extension have been stored.<br><br><br>![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) This constant is not available. The directories have no root.<br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This constant and *zipDirectory* will have the same effect.**Archives in 7z format**: This constant and *zipDirectory* will have the same effect. |
| *zipInMemory* | Extracts the file in memory. The file content is directly returned by the function. It can be assigned to a Buffer variable for example.<br>This feature is available for ZIP and WDZ archives only. |
| *zipNone* | Extraction into the current directory without restoring the tree structure of file (if it was stored). |


	![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) These constants cannot be used.




**`<Progress>: (Control name or procedure name)`**

Progress bar management mode. This parameter can correspond to: 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) the name of a Progress Bar control found in a window. The progress bar will display the progress of file extraction.  

- the name of a WLanguage procedure. This procedure has the following format: 
	
	```txt
	<Nom de la procédure> (<Fichier en cours>, <Pourcentage d'avancement>)
	```

	where: 

	- &lt;Current file&gt; corresponds to the name of the file currently processed. 

	- &lt;Progress percentage&gt; corresponds to the progress percentage of the file being extracted from the archive. 







Caution: The progress bar is refreshed at the end of file extraction for the following types of archives: 

- TAR or TGZ (TAR.GZ), 

- RAR, 

- CAB.

## Remarks


### Error codes
<a name="error_codes_ELTPARAGRAPHE000520"></a>

The following error codes are returned:

- 1: The path passed as parameter does not exist.

- 2: Access denied: the user has no sufficient rights.

- 6: The files of the sub-archives are not arranged in order (when extracting from a multi-part archive).

- 21: The specified password is not correct.




The message corresponding to the error code is returned by [zipMsgError](../WDLang3/3082034.md).
Reminder: 

- ![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png)![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) Only ZIP, TAR and TGZ (TAR.GZ) archives are available.

- ![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Only ZIP archives are available.

- RAR is supported up to and including version 4.



<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Extracted file
<a name="extracted_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000551"></a>

The extracted file is not deleted from the archive. To delete one file or all the files from the archive, use [&lt;zipArchive variable&gt;.DeleteFile](../WDLang3/1000019152.md) or [&lt;zipArchive variable&gt;.DeleteAll](../WDLang3/1000019154.md).

### Extraction and password
<a name="extraction_and_password_ELTPARAGRAPHE000573"></a>

If the file is not encrypted and if [zipPassword](../WDLang3/3082053.md) was used:

- Archive in WDZ format: The file is still extracted.

- Archive in ZIP format: An error occurs.

### Index of files in the archive
<a name="index_files_the_archive_ELTPARAGRAPHE000589"></a>

When a file is added into an archive, an index is automatically assigned to the file. This index corresponds to the order in which the files are included in the archive. To select a file in the archive, you can use:

- the index of the element (the index of an element is returned by [SearchFile](../WDLang3/1000026330.md)).

- the stored path of the element.


<a name="NOTE0_5"></a>


### Stored path
<a name="stored_path_ELTPARAGRAPHE000608"></a>

The table below presents the paths stored in the archive according to:

- the access path to the file,

- the stored path section.




The current directory is: "C:\\Temp".


|   |   |   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **zipAddFile** | **File location** | *zipNone* | *zipDirectory* | *zipDrive* |
| zipAddFile("Archi",...<br>"File.txt") | C:\\Temp\\File.txt | File.txt | File.txt | File.txt |
| zipAddFile("Archi",...<br>"Data\\File.txt") | C:\\Temp\\Data\\File.txt | File.txt | Data\\File.txt | Data\\File.txt |
| zipAddFile("Archi",...<br>"D:\\Data\\File.txt") | D:\\Data\\File.txt | File.txt | Data\\File.txt | D:\\Data\\File.txt |


**Remark**: If the *zipDrive* constant is used: 

- the WDZ format stores the full path of the file (including the drive letter). 

- the ZIP format does not store the drive letter.

- the 7z format stores the directories only.


![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) The *zipDrive* constant is equivalent to the *zipDirectory* constant.![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) The directory and the disk are not stored in the archive path. Only the file name and extension are stored.
