**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the request for product consumption was performed,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md).

- Identifier of the product to the consume, 

- Name of [inAppProduct](../WDLang3/1000020868.md) variable corresponding to the product to consume.




**`<Purchase identifier>: (Character string)`**

Purchase identifier of product to the consume. This identifier is received when purchasing a product with [inAppPurchaseProduct](../WDLang3/1000020873.md). It can also be retrieved by [inAppListPurchase](../WDLang3/1000020888.md).

**`<WLanguage procedure>: (Procedure name)`**

Name of WLanguage procedure ("callback" procedure) run when receiving the response to the request for product consumption. This procedure has the following format:

&lt;Success&gt; is boolean: 

- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the product was consumed,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) before any other call to a WLanguage function (this would reinitialize the error).
