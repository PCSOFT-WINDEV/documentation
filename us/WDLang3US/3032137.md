### Method for accessing Outlook
<a name="method_for_accessing_outlook_ELTPARAGRAPHE000018"></a>

The Outlook access method is as follows: 

1. Starting a session for accessing the emails, tasks, appointments, contacts and/or groups of contacts: [EmailStartOutlookSession](../WDLang3/3032128.md) or [OutlookStartSession](../WDLang3/3032123.md). You can also use [EmailStartSession](../WDLang3/3032028.md) with a variable of type [emailOutlookSession](../WDLang3/1000018767.md).

2. Stopping the session: [CloseSession](../WDLang3/3032124.md) or [EmailCloseSession](../WDLang3/3032006.md).

### Sending and receiving emails
<a name="sending_and_receiving_emails_ELTPARAGRAPHE000046"></a>

To send and receive emails, Outlook must be started on the current computer.

To actually send and receive emails:

- **Sending and receiving emails automatically**: Select the following options in the options of Outlook:

	- "Send the messages immediately during the connection". 

	- "Check the new incoming messages every X minutes" and specify the requested number of minutes.




- **Sending and receiving emails manually**: Click the "Send/Receive" button.

### Version of Outlook
<a name="version_outlook_ELTPARAGRAPHE000061"></a>

The access to Outlook is available for Outlook version 97 or later.

Remark: The groups of contacts are not supported by Outlook 97. Therefore, they cannot be accessed in this version of Outlook.

Caution: Only the emails can be accessed in Outlook Express. In this case, use [EmailStartSession](../WDLang3/3032028.md) to start the session for accessing emails.

### MS Exchange server
<a name="exchange_server_ELTPARAGRAPHE000075"></a>

- The access to Outlook is compatible with the MS Exchange servers but it requires the presence of an Outlook client on the computer.

- When using the Exchange or Outlook functions in a WEBDEV site, an Outlook client must be installed and configured on the server in the profile of the Internet guest.

## Handling data
<a name="handling_data_ELTTEXTE000242"></a>
Once the session for accessing Outlook was started, you have the ability to handle:

- the emails via the [Email functions](../WDLang3/3032034.md). 
	Caution: If an Outlook user owns several messaging accounts and several data files (pst file) in his profile, only the emails found in the pst file linked to the server (default pst file) will be read. 

- the tasks via the [Task functions](../WDLang3/1000012009.md).

- the appointments via the [Appointment functions](../WDLang3/1000011009.md).

- the contacts via the [Contact functions](../WDLang3/1000006110.md).

- the groups of contacts via the [Group functions](../WDLang3/1000008119.md).

### Limitations
<a name="limitations_ELTPARAGRAPHE000120"></a>

- The WLanguage functions can be used to write the information into the "Contacts" database of Outlook but not into the "Address Book" database. Depending on the creation mode of the email in Outlook, Outlook proposes:

	- the addresses of contacts (containing the addresses managed WINDEV).

	- the addresses of the address book.




- When used in in a WEBDEV site, an Outlook client must be installed and configured on the server in the profile of the Internet guest.

- To access Outlook in 64-bit mode, the WINDEV application must also be in 64-bit mode.
