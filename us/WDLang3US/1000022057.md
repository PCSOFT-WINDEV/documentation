The **btleService** type is used to handle a Bluetooth Low Energy service ("Bluetooth GATT Service"). 

Each Bluetooth LE service is identified by a unique character string (UUID) and it contains a set of characteristics. A list of different standard services can be found on the site 
[https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/gatt/services](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/gatt/services).
For more details about the standard specifications, see: 
[https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/protocol-specifications](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/protocol-specifications).

The characteristics of Bluetooth LE service can be defined and modified by several WLanguage properties. 

**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).
