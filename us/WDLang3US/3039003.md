<a name="Use"></a>
<a name="description"></a>
Associates a stream connection request with a Conference control. This function must be used in the event "Connection request of new stream" associated with the stream.
<a name="Example1"></a>
<a name="sample_code"></a>

## Example


```wl
// -- Event "Connection request of new stream"
// Procedure used to detect a new stream
// nStreamID is an integer variable containing the identifier of the detected stream
PROCEDURE NewStream(nStreamID)
// Accept the detected stream? CBOX_Auto_Response is a Check Box control
IF CBOX_Auto_Response[1] = True THEN
	StreamAccept(nStreamID, MySelf)
ELSE
	StreamReject(nStreamID)
END
```

## Syntax

`<Result> = StreamAccept(<Connection identifier> , <Conference control>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the stream was associated with the Conference control, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise (invalid identifier, control not found, ...). To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md).




**`<Connection identifier>: (Integer)`**

Identifier of stream connection. This connection will be associated with a Conference control and therefore with the stream to which the control is associated. This identifier is defined in the event "Connection request of new stream" associated with the stream.

**`<Conference control>: (Control name)`**

Name of a Conference control that accepts the connection.

## Remarks


### StreamAccept: Operations performed
<a name="streamaccept_operations_performed_ELTPARAGRAPHE000044"></a>

The stream associated with the control is linked to this connection.

The stream establishes links to all the Conference controls linked to it.

The identifier of the connection (and therefore the identifier of the stream) is returned:

- with the [Value](../Proprietes/2510130.md) property.

- by using the name of the stream directly.

- by using the name of the Conference control directly.




If the Conference control is already connected with a stream, the stream is automatically disconnected.

### Procedure for stream detection
<a name="procedure_for_stream_detection_ELTPARAGRAPHE000192"></a>

A stream is associated with the event "Connection request of new stream". This event is run when a request to connect to an incoming stream is detected.

This event is run in one of the following cases: 

- if the [Detection](../Proprietes/2510031.md) property applied to the stream is set to <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>.

- if the option "Detection of active incoming streams" has been checked in the stream description window.




**Remark**: This event is run in a specific thread of WLanguage. Therefore, it is subject to limitations specific to the threads. For more details on threads, see [Managing threads with WINDEV](../WDLang1/3077026.md).

Furthermore, with instant messaging, you have the ability to send a file to your contact and to dialog with him.
