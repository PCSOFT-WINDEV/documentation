## Syntax

### Extracting a file identified by its index

`<Result> = zipExtractFile(<Archive> , <File index> [, <File destination> [, <Progress>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer or buffer)`**



- 0 if the file was extracted,

- An error code (value greater than 0) otherwise. For more details on these error codes, see the [Remarks](#NOTE0_1).




When extracting "in memory", corresponds to the buffer containing the extracted file.

**`<Archive>: (Character string or zipArchive variable)`**

Name of the archive to be used.
This name can correspond to:

- an archive name defined with [zipOpen](../WDLang3/3082044.md) or [zipCreate](../WDLang3/3082003.md).

- the name of a variable of type [zipArchive](../WDLang3/1000018679.md). 
	![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Variables of type [zipArchive](../WDLang3/1000018679.md) are not available in Java.




**`<File index>: (entier)`**

Index of file to extract from the archive.  [zipFindFile](../WDLang3/3082002.md) returns this index. 

**`<File destination>: (Optional character string or constant)`**

Destination path of extracted file:

- Optional character string: The file is extracted into the specified path to which is added the stored tree structure of file (the drive is not stored). The specified path is created if it does not exist.
	![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) The destination path of the extracted file must correspond to the working directory of the application (returned by [fDataDir](../WDLang1/3036001.md)) or one of its subdirectories.

- Optional constant:

**`<Progress>: (Control name or procedure name)`**

Progress bar management mode. This parameter can correspond to: 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) the name of a Progress Bar control found in a window. The progress bar will display the progress of file extraction.  

- the name of a WLanguage procedure. This procedure has the following format: 
	
	```txt
	<Nom de la procédure> (<Fichier en cours>, <Pourcentage d'avancement>)
	```

	where: 

	- &lt;Current file&gt; corresponds to the name of the file currently processed. 

	- &lt;Progress percentage&gt; corresponds to the progress percentage of the file being extracted from the archive.

## Remarks


### Error codes
<a name="error_codes_ELTPARAGRAPHE000372"></a>

The following error codes are returned:

- 1: The path passed as parameter does not exist.

- 2: Access denied: the user has no sufficient rights.

The message corresponding to the error code is returned by [zipMsgError](../WDLang3/3082034.md).
Reminder: 

- ![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png)![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) Only ZIP, TAR and TGZ (TAR.GZ) archives are available.

### Extracted file
<a name="extracted_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000402"></a>

The extracted file is not deleted from the archive. To delete one file or all the files from the archive, use [zipDeleteFile](../WDLang3/3082041.md) or [zipDeleteAll](../WDLang3/3082051.md).
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png)![User code (UMC)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/MCU.png) 

### Extraction and password
<a name="extraction_and_password_ELTPARAGRAPHE000419"></a>

If the file is not encrypted and if [zipPassword](../WDLang3/3082053.md) was used:

- Archive in WDZ format: The file is still extracted.

- Archive in ZIP format: An error occurs.



<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Index of files in the archive
<a name="index_files_the_archive_ELTPARAGRAPHE000434"></a>

When a file is added into an archive, an index is automatically assigned to the file. This index corresponds to the order in which the files are included in the archive. To select a file in the archive, you can use:

- the index of the element (the index of an element is returned by [zipFindFile](../WDLang3/3082002.md)).

- the stored path of the element.



<a name="NOTE0_5"></a>


### Stored path
<a name="stored_path_ELTPARAGRAPHE000449"></a>

The table below presents the paths stored in the archive according to:

- the access path to the file,

- the stored path section.




The current directory is: "C:\\Temp".


|   |   |   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **zipAddFile** | **File location** | *zipNone* | *zipDirectory* | *zipDrive* |
| zipAddFile("Archi",...<br>"File.txt") | C:\\Temp\\File.txt | File.txt | File.txt | File.txt |
| zipAddFile("Archi",...<br>"Data\\File.txt") | C:\\Temp\\Data\\File.txt | File.txt | Data\\File.txt | Data\\File.txt |
| zipAddFile("Archi",...<br>"D:\\Data\\File.txt") | D:\\Data\\File.txt | File.txt | Data\\File.txt | D:\\Data\\File.txt |


**Remark**: If the *zipDrive* constant is used: 

- the WDZ format stores the full path of the file (including the drive letter). 

- the ZIP format does not store the drive letter.

- the 7z format stores the directories only.


![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) The *zipDrive* constant is equivalent to the *zipDirectory* constant.![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) The directory and the disk are not stored in the archive path. Only the file name and extension are stored.
