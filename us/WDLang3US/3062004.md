Retrieves the number of pending bytes in the input buffer of a specified serial port or infrared port.

**Remarks**: 

- This function cannot be used with a parallel port.

- ![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Infrared ports are not supported.

- ![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) Only serial ports are supported.

## Example


```wl
// The port is opened. Retrieves the number of pending bytes
// in the input buffer of COM4 and read them.
PortNum is int
PortNum = sOpen("COM4", 2000, 2000)
Number is int
MessageRead is string
Number = sInEntryQueue(PortNum)
MessageRead = sRead(PortNum, Number)
// Equivalent to: MessageRead = sRead(PortNum, sInEntryQueue(PortNum))
```

## Syntax

`<Result> = sInEntryQueue(<Port number>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**



- Number of pending bytes in the input buffer of the specified port, 

- 0 if the function failed. The [ErrorOccurred](../WDLang1/3087001.md) variable is set to <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if an error occurred on the port (parity bit for example). The error details are returned by [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md).




**`<Port number>: (Integer)`**

Port number to use: 

- Number of the serial port: 1, 2, 3, ... 32 for COM1, COM2, COM3, ... COM32.

- Number of the infrared port: 1, 2, 3, ... 32 for IR1, IR2, IR3, ... IR32.
	![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) The management of infrared ports is not available in Java.

- Port number returned by [sOpen](../WDLang3/3062013.md) (if this function was called with a port name).

### Using an external library: RXTX
<a name="using_external_library_rxtx_ELTPARAGRAPHE000097"></a>

In Java, the use of functions for handling the serial and parallel ports ([sOpen](../WDLang3/3062013.md), [sWrite](../WDLang3/3062009.md), [sRead](../WDLang3/3062012.md), ...) requires the presence of an external library: RXTX. 

This library includes a Jar archive and one or more native libraries that depend on the operating system on which the application is run.
 
To use these functions: 

- the Jar archive (RXTXComm.jar) must: 

	- be found in the same directory as the Java application generated by WINDEV, 

	- be found in the execution classpath of the application, 

	- be directly included in the generated application (from the wizard for Java generation). 




- the native libraries corresponding to the operating system on which the application is run must be found: 

	- in the same directory as the Java application generated by WINDEV, 

	- in the path of the application libraries (librarypath).







The RXTX library and its documentation can be downloaded from: [http://users.frii.com/jarvi/rxtx/index.html](http://users.frii.com/jarvi/rxtx/index.html) (link valid at the time this documentation was published). 

**Caution**: The management of infrared ports is not available in Java.
