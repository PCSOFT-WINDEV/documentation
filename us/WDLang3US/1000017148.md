## Example


```wl
sMACAddress is string
// Retrieve the MAC address of Bluetooth device
// The address is stored in a table column
sMACAddress = TABLE_Devices.COL_MACAddr[TABLE_Devices]
// OBEX connection
EDT_OBEXID = OBEXConnect(obexBluetooth, sMACAddress)
...
// Retrieve the simple list of shared files
FileList is string = OBEXListFile(EDT_OBEXID)
```

## Syntax

`<Result> = OBEXListFile(<Identifier of OBEX connection> [, <Home directory> [, <Level of details>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Character string)`**

List of directory files:

- ***in simple mode***: list in the following format: 
	&lt;Name of file 1&gt; + TAB + &lt;Type 1&gt; + CR + ... &lt;Name of file N&gt; + TAB + &lt;Type N&gt; 
	where &lt;Type&gt; corresponds to "F" if the element is a file and to "D" if the element is a directory.

- ***in detailed mode***: list in the following format: 
	&lt;Name of File 1&gt; + TAB + &lt;Type 1&gt; + TAB + &lt;Size in Bytes 1&gt; + TAB + &lt;Rights 1&gt; + TAB + &lt;Modification Date 1&gt; + TAB + &lt;Creation Date 1&gt; + TAB + &lt;Access Date 1&gt; + CR + ... 
	where &lt;Type&gt; corresponds to "F" if the element is a file and to "D" if the element is a directory, 
	&lt;Rights&gt; is a string that can contain the letters "R" (read rights), "W" (write rights) and "D" (erase rights). 
	Dates are in "YYYYMMDDHHmmSS" format.




**If the *obexListDirectory* constant is used**, these lists will also contain the sub-directories. This list may possibly contain a ".." directory if the root of the tree structure of the OBEX server is not listed.

**`<Identifier of OBEX connection>: (Integer)`**

Identifier of the OBEX connection to use. This identifier is returned by [OBEXConnect](../WDLang3/1000017153.md).

**`<Home directory>: (Optional character string)`**

Name of the directory to list. The transfer directory is used if this parameter is not specified.

**`<Level of details>: (Optional Integer constant (or combination of constants))`**

Level of result details:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *obexListDetailed* | &lt;Result&gt; contains the list of files in detailed mode. |
| *obexListDirectory* | &lt;Result&gt; contains the list of files and directories. This constant can be combined with *obexListSimple* and *obexListDetailed*. When it is used on its own, it is equivalent to *obexListSimple* + *obexListDirectory*. |
| *obexListSimple*<br>(Default value) | &lt;Result&gt; contains the list of files in simple mode. |

## Remarks




### Operating mode
<a name="operating_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000075"></a>

The name of the directory to list is not always known. A first call to **OBEXListFile** (without directory name) is used to list the root of OBEX tree structure. If the mobile devices supports the creation of sub-directories, you will have the ability to call **OBEXListFile** by specifying the name of a subdirectory.

### Limitation
<a name="limitation_ELTPARAGRAPHE000087"></a>

Only the Microsoft bluetooth stacks are supported by this function. To know the stack used, call [BTStack](../WDLang3/1000017229.md). 

For more details, see [Which stacks to use?](../WDLang3/1000017231.md)
