| [HTTPCookieReset](../WDLang3/1000019232.md) | Deletes all cookies (globally or for a domain) stored: <br><br>- by the calls to [HTTPRequest](../WDLang3/3043007.md).<br><br>- by the calls to [HTTPSend](../WDLang3/1000021183.md).<br><br><br> |
| [HTTPCookieWrite](../WDLang3/1000019234.md) | Adds or modifies a cookie in an HTTP request. |

| [HTTPListCertificate](../WDLang3/1000018890.md) | Lists the client certificates found on the computer to authenticate on a server. |
| [HTTPProgressBar](../WDLang3/3043009.md) | Displays a progress bar when: <br><br>- receiving the response to an HTTP request.<br><br>- sending an HTTP form ([HTTPSendForm](../WDLang3/1000017190.md)) or an HTTP query.<br><br><br> |
| [HTTPRequest](../WDLang3/3043007.md) | Starts an HTTP request on a server. |

| [HTTPTimeOut](../WDLang3/3043008.md) | Sets the timeout for WLanguage functions that use the HTTP protocol ([HTTPRequest](../WDLang3/3043007.md), [SOAPExecute](../WDLang3/3069013.md), [DotNetExecute](../WDLang3/3031016.md), [J2EEExecute](../WDLang3/3047007.md), etc.). |
| [InternetConnected](../WDLang3/3043005.md) | Defines whether an Internet connection is enabled on the current computer. In mobile, you can also be notified when the status of the Internet connection changes. |
| [OpenAPIToHTTP](../WDLang3/1410088947.md) | Builds the HTTP request to call a function of an API. It can then be sent using [HTTPSend](../WDLang3/1000021183.md). |

The following advanced types can be used with the HTTP functions:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [Cookie](../WDLang3/1000019222.md) | The **Cookie** type is used to handle the cookies transmitted in the HTTP requests. |
| [httpProgress](../WDLang3/1000021222.md) | The **httpProgress** type is used to manage the progress when sending or receiving an HTTP request. |
| [httpRequest](../WDLang3/1000021158.md) | The **httpRequest** type is used to retrieve the advanced characteristics of an HTTP/HTTPS request. |
| [httpResponse](../WDLang3/1000021165.md) | The **httpResponse** type is used to get the advanced characteristics of the response of the HTTP/HTTPS request. |
| [restRequest](../WDLang3/1000021481.md) | The **restRequest** type is used to define the advanced characteristics of a REST request. |
| [restResponse](../WDLang3/1000021477.md) | The **restResponse** type is used to define all the advanced characteristics of a REST response. |

- ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WDTraceSocket.gif) ***Sample components (WINDEV)*** : **WD Trace Socket** <br>The purpose of this example is to trace everything that occurs on a communication via socket, on a specific address, on a specific port. This example allows you to understand the principle of dialog via socket between two applications.<br>Therefore, in the applications that dialog via socket, even if no trace option as implemented by the developers, you will have he ability to view all the exchanges performed on the socket.<br>This example also enables you to understand the operating mode of the network protocols based on the sockets: POP3, SMTP, FTP, HTTP, and so on.<br>Note for the users who are experienced in network communication: <br>This example does not allow you to trace the UDP packages (only the TCP communications can be traced).
