Defines the WLanguage procedure that will be called when the location of the user changes. 

**Caution**: 

- Before using this function, [geoTrackingEnable](../WDLang3/1000021583.md) must be used to enable location tracking. 

- To be run in the background, this function must be called in the "Initializing" event associated with the project. For more details, see [Remarks](#NOTE0_1).

## Example


```wl
// -- Project initialization (REQUIRED to run the function in the background)
geoTrackingProcedure(TrackingProcedure)
```

```wl
// Implement the TrackingProcedure procedure
PROCEDURE TrackingProcedure(mLocation is geoPosition)
// Send the location to the server
SendServer(mLocation)
```

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = geoTrackingProcedure(<WLanguage procedure>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the location tracking system is available,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if the location tracking system is not available. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md). 




**`<WLanguage procedure>: (Procedure name)`**

Name of WLanguage procedure called when the location of the user changes. 

This procedure has the following format: 

```txt
PROCEDURE <Procedure name>(<Location> is geoPosition)
```


In this code, &lt;Location&gt; is a [geoPosition](../WDLang3/1000019191.md) variable corresponding to the current location of the user. 

This procedure must be a global procedure of application.

## Remarks


### Specific features
<a name="specific_features_ELTPARAGRAPHE000066"></a>

- **geoTrackingProcedure** must be called in the project initialization code. Indeed, the WLanguage procedure can be called just after the initialization, for a clock in background mode for example.

- If the application is in stand-by mode, it is automatically restarted when a location is received.

### Tracking management: low precision
<a name="tracking_management_low_precision_ELTPARAGRAPHE000081"></a>

Caution: This location tracking has low precision. The events are sent only if significant changes of location occur and at time intervals exceeding several minutes. For information, the sending conditions per platform are as follows: 


For a more precise tracking, you must use [GPSFollowMovement](../WDLang3/1000019206.md). However, this function: 

- requires the application to be started,

- consumes more battery.
