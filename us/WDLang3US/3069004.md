## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000179"></a>
The SOAP Server application is an application containing all the procedures to run. These procedures are run by the SOAP client application.

## How to create a SOAP Server application?

### Creating a SOAP Server application
<a name="creating_soap_server_application_ELTPARAGRAPHE000026"></a>

To create a SOAP server application: 

1. Create a WINDEV project.

2. Create the global procedures. Each global procedure can be run by the SOAP client. 
	Caution: the server application must have no interface (no window, report, trace window or dialog box). This application is also limited by the rights granted to the Web server.

3. Type (if necessary) the initialization code and the project closing code. These two sections of code will be respectively run when loading and unloading the library on the server.

4. Create the library of your project (.WDL file). This file contains all the procedures of the project.




Remark: In the SOAP Client application, the name of the library used (WDL) must be specified in the **namespace** (see [SOAPRun](../WDLang3/3069013.md)).

**Caution**: The transfers are not secured at the moment (the data transferred is not encrypted). The SOAP protocol should not be used to transfer sensitive data.

### Hosting different versions of WINDEV SOAP servers
<a name="hosting_different_versions_windev_soap_servers_ELTPARAGRAPHE000047"></a>

Different versions of WINDEV Web services can be hosted on a IIS HTTP server: to do so, define 2 different extensions in the Inetmgr.exe program (".soap12" and ".soap17" for example).

Two different versions cannot be hosted on an Apache server.

### Running the test of your SOAP server application on the development computer
<a name="running_the_test_your_soap_server_application_the_development_computer_ELTPARAGRAPHE000056"></a>

To run the test of your SOAP server application on the development computer: 

1. Create the library (.WDL file) of your Server application. Create a project configuration to generate the library if necessary.

2. Configure the Internet server installed on your computer for your WINDEV application:

	- [Configuration for Apache](../WDLang3/3086004.md)

	- [Configuration for IIS](../WDLang3/3086005.md)

	- [Configuration for Netscape iPlanet 4.1.](../WDLang3/3086006.md)




3. Configure the SOAP administrator (WDSOAPConfig.EXE application in "Data" directory of WINDEV). For more details, see [Configuring the administrator](../WDLang3/3086007.md).

4. Restart your Web server.

5. Run the test of your SOAP client application.

### Installing your application on a SOAP server
<a name="installing_your_application_soap_server_ELTPARAGRAPHE000079"></a>

To install your application on a SOAP server: 

1. Create the library (.WDL file) of your Server application. Create a project configuration to generate the library if necessary. 
	Caution: The WINDEV DLLs must not be renamed.

2. Create the setup program of your application: on the "Project" tab, in the "Generation" group, expand "Setup procedure" and select "Create setup procedure".
	The following files must be selected for the setup:

	- WDSOAPConfig.EXE application found in the "Data" directory of the installation directory of WINDEV.

	- the WINDEV DLLs required to run your application. Check whether the following DLLs are selected: wdxxxobj.dll, wdxxxpnt.dll, wdxxxstd.dll and wdxxxvm.dll.

	- the WINDEV DLLs specific to the HTTP server used: wdxxxsapa.dll for Apache 1.3, wdxxxsapa2.dll for Apache 2.0, wdxxxsiis for IIS, ...




3. Install the application on the server.  

4. Configure the Internet server for your WINDEV application:

	- [Configuration for Apache](../WDLang3/3086004.md)

	- [Configuration for IIS](../WDLang3/3086005.md)

	- [Configuration for Netscape iPlanet 4.1.](../WDLang3/3086006.md)




5. Configure the SOAP administrator. For more details, see [Configuring the administrator](../WDLang3/3086007.md).

6. In order for the SOAP client to contact the server, the server address used in [SOAPRun](../WDLang3/3069013.md) must have the following format:
	
	```txt
	<IP address of server>\Server.soap
	```





**Remark**: If several soap server applications are installed on the same computer, you must necessarily install:

- all the libraries (WDL) in the same directory.

- all the WINDEV DLLs used in the same directory.




A single SOAP administrator will be installed and used.

**Caution**: The rights granted to the user of the http site are very important. If a WINDEV SOAP server must write into a file, write rights must be granted to the user of the site (Internet guest).
