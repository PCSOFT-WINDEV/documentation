### Sending a specific FTP command to a server

`<Result> = FTPCommand(<Connection identifier> , <FTP command> [, <Server response> [, <Result of command> [, <Transfer mode> [, <Data to send>]]]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the command was run,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if a problem occurred.




**`<Connection identifier>: (Integer)`**

Connection identifier, returned by [FTPConnect](../WDLang3/3040016.md).

**`<FTP command>: (Character string)`**

FTP command sent to the server.

**`<Server response>: (Optional character string)`**

Character string variable containing the server response for the specified FTP command. This parameter enables you to get the server response on the connection channel (the connection channel allows error or success messages to be received).

**`<Result of command>: (Optional ANSI character string)`**

ANSI Character String variable containing the data corresponding to the result of the specified FTP command. This result is returned by the server on the data channel.

**Caution**: If this parameter is specified, **FTPCommand** locks the computer until a result is received. More specifically, if the command does not expect a result through the data channel, the client is locked indefinitely. For more details, see the RFC959 specification.

**`<Transfer mode>: (Optional Integer constant)`**

Transfer mode used:					


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *ftpASCIIMode* | Transfer performed in ASCII mode. This mode is used to transfer data between two different types of operating systems, from UNIX to Windows for example: the transferred file is changed into the ASCII format of destination system. |
| *ftpBinaryMode* <br>(Default value) | Transfer performed in binary mode: The file is strictly identical between the sending and the receiving. |



**`<Data to send>: (Optional character string)`**

Data associated with the FTP command that will be sent to the FTP server. This data is sent through the data channel.

## Remarks


### Reminder about the FTP protocol
<a name="reminder_about_the_ftp_protocol_ELTPARAGRAPHE000127"></a>

This protocol is using 2 communication channels:

- **A command channel**: is used to send commands and to receive error or success messages, 

- **A data channel** used to transfer the data associated with the command.



<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### FTP commands
<a name="ftp_commands_ELTPARAGRAPHE000137"></a>

All the commands that can be used on an FTP server are found in the RFC989 specification. This document is available on the Internet (use a search engine and search for the RFC959 reference).

**Some standard examples: Uploading and downloading files with FTPCommand**

1. Downloading files:


```txt
Response, ResData are strings 
FTPCommand(<Connection identifier>, ...
	"RETR" + <Name file server>, ...
	Response, ResData, <Transfer mode>)
// ResData contains the file
```


2. Uploading files:


```txt
Response, ResData, DataResult are strings 
// ResData contains the file to upload
FTPCommand(<Connection identifier>,...
	"STOR " + <Name File server>, ...
	Response, DataResult, <Transfer mode>, ResData)
```

### Example: Getting a TEST file found in the AAA library of an AS/400: 
<a name="example_getting_test_file_found_the_aaa_library_as400_ELTPARAGRAPHE000155"></a>


```wl
Response, ResData are strings 
FTPID = FTPConnect("as400", "login", "PWD")
FTPCommand(FTPID,"RETR " + "AAA/TEST", Response, ResData)
// ResData contains the file
fSaveText("C:\Tmp\test", ResData)
```
