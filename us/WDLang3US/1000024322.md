## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000075"></a>
WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile include a Chart control (that can be used in the window editor, page editor and report editor) as well as several functions used to create and handle charts.
![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) **Using charts in WEBDEV Linux and in WINDEV Linux**
To use the charts in Linux, the QT library (Core and GUI) version 5 (or later) must be installed. 

**In Ubuntu**, this library can be installed with the following commands: 


```txt
sudo apt-get install libqtcore5
sudo apt-get install libqtgui5
```

### Creating charts through programming
<a name="creating_charts_through_programming_ELTPARAGRAPHE000172"></a>

WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile include several functions for handling charts. These functions allow you to create the charts, to modify them, to change the display options...

The following operations are used to create the charts: 

1. Create the chart with [grCreate](../WDLang3/3042005.md).

2. Initialize the chart data with the following functions:

	- [&lt;Chart&gt;.AddData](../WDLang3/1000023533.md).

	- [&lt;Chart&gt;.ScatterAddDataXY](../WDLang3/1000024105.md) for the Scatter charts.

	- [&lt;Chart&gt;.StockAddData](../WDLang3/1000023565.md) for the Stock charts.

	- [&lt;Chart&gt;.SurfaceAddData](../WDLang3/1000024143.md) for the Surface charts. 

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) [&lt;Chart&gt;.SunburstAddData](../WDLang3/1000024132.md) for the Sunburst charts.

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) [&lt;Chart&gt;.HMAddData](../WDLang3/1000024079.md) for the Heatmap charts.




3. Choose the display destination of the chart with the following functions:

	- [grDestinationControl](../WDLang3/3042020.md): to display the chart in an Image control

	- [grDestinationWnd](../WDLang3/3042031.md): to display the chart in an independent window
			

	- [grDestinationBMP](../WDLang3/3042018.md), [grDestinationEMF](../WDLang3/3042017.md) or [grDestinationWMF](../WDLang3/3042019.md) to save the chart in files in BMP, EMF or WMF format respectively. 

	- [grDestinationImage](../WDLang3/1000020952.md): to save the chart in an [Image](../WDLang1/1000019650.md) variable directly. 




4. Draw the chart with [&lt;Chart&gt;.Draw](../WDLang3/1000024062.md).




Several functions are used to configure and modify the appearance of the chart. You have the ability to display a legend, the title of axes, ... For more details, see the list of [functions for chart management](../WDLang3/1000024173.md).

### Charts and threads
<a name="charts_and_threads_ELTPARAGRAPHE000274"></a>

A single chart can be handled in a thread.

Consequences:

- Two threads cannot handle the same chart.

- A chart created in a thread is automatically destroyed at the end of this thread. The chart exists in the thread that contains the call to [grCreate](../WDLang3/3042005.md).

### Default values of a chart (in a window or in a page)
<a name="default_values_chart_window_page_ELTPARAGRAPHE000294"></a>

The default values of a chart are as follows:

- Context menu enabled (can be configured by [&lt;Chart&gt;.Menu](../WDLang3/1000024094.md) and [&lt;Chart&gt;.MenuOption](../WDLang3/1000024112.md)).
