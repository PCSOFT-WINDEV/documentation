Connects a client computer to a given socket.

**Remarks**:

- **UDP sockets**: The UDP protocol being a "connectionless" protocol, **SocketConnect** cannot be used with the UDP protocol. To send or receive data with the UDP protocol, you must create a UDP socket ([SocketCreateUDP](../WDLang3/3070019.md)) then send/receive data with the "special UDP" syntaxes of [SocketWrite](../WDLang3/3070002.md) and [SocketRead](../WDLang3/3070014.md). 

- **SSL sockets**: To send or receive data with the SSL protocol, you must create an SSL socket ([SocketCreateSSL](../WDLang3/1000017041.md)) and connect to this socket with [SocketConnectSSL](../WDLang3/1000017042.md).

- **Communication with robots or with non-WINDEV applications**: To simplify the exchanges of data by socket, a transmission mode is initialized by default. For a communication with an external module (non-WINDEV application, robot, ...), this transmission mode can prevent the communications from operating properly. [SocketChangeTransmissionMode](../WDLang3/3070005.md) is used to change this transmission mode (the *SocketNoEndTag* constant allows you not to modify the frames read and written).




**Reminder**: A socket is a communication resource used by applications to communicate from one computer to another regardless of the type of network.

## Syntax

### Connecting to a socket

`<Result> = SocketConnect(<Socket name> , <Port number> [, <Address> [, <Maximum timeout>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the function was successful,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. If an error occurs, you can get more details on the error with [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md).




**`<Socket name>: (Character string)`**

Name that will be given to the connection opened on the server socket. This name will be used by all socket functions.
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Caution: The socket name is case sensitive.

**`<Port number>: (Integer)`**

Port number of the socket. If you are using a socket associated with a preset protocol, use the port number associated with the protocol.
If the socket was created by a WINDEV application, this number must be included between 5 000 and 65 000. In this case, the number must be identical to the port number specified in [SocketCreate](../WDLang3/3070011.md).

**`<Address>: (Optional character string)`**

Server address. If this parameter is not specified, the server is sought on the current computer. This address can be given in the following format:

- IP address in XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX format (125.5.110.100 for example).

- URL containing the server name (www.windev.com for example). This syntax is recommended.


![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) The address can also correspond to the IP address returned by [NetIPAddress](../WDLang3/3056023.md).

**`<Maximum timeout>: (Optional integer or optional Duration)`**

Maximum timeout (in milliseconds) for establishing the connection. This timeout will be used if the server refuses the connection ([SocketDeny](../WDLang3/3070010.md)). In this case, the connection will not be locking. This parameter can correspond to: 

- an integer corresponding to the number of milliseconds,

- a Duration variable,

- the duration in a readable format (e.g., 1 s or 10 ms). 


This timeout is set to 5000 milliseconds by default (5 seconds). For more details, see [the remarks](#NOTE0_2).

### Optimizing the connections for an IP address
<a name="optimizing_the_connections_for_address_ELTPARAGRAPHE000244"></a>

When an IP address is passed to **SocketConnect**, the connection can be optimized by using the following code:  

```wl
Socket.Option = SocketOptimizeIPConnection
```
This option is not enabled by default because the connection may fail in some configurations. However, it may be useful in some applications for which the performance is critical.

**Remark**: To restore the default behavior, simply use the *SocketOptionDefault* constant:

```wl
Socket.Option = SocketOptionDefault
```

### Timeout
<a name="timeout_ELTPARAGRAPHE000260"></a>

The timeout specified by &lt;Maximum timeout&gt; groups the timeout of two steps:

- the timeout for address resolution: this timeout cannot be configured and it can be optimized (see below).

- the maximum timeout for the connection to be accepted by the server. Several cases may occur:

	- the server refuses the connection.

	- the server accepts the connection within the timeout.

	- the server is not available.

	- the specified address is invalid.







To optimize the timeout for address resolution (time required to find the address), we advise you to:

- use a DNS on the network. Therefore, this address will be sought toward this server and not for each computer (1 search instead of x searches where x represents the number of computers). Each computer must be registered toward this server.

- for an IP address, use the **Socket.Option** variable as follows: 
	
	```wl
	Socket.Option = SocketOptimizeIPConnection
	```

### Connecting to an infrared port
<a name="connecting_infrared_port_ELTPARAGRAPHE000287"></a>

To connect to a socket that is using an infrared port:

1. Create a socket using the infrared port on the server ([SocketCreateInfrared](../WDLang3/3070012.md) in a WINDEV application).

2. In the client application (WINDEV application), use [SocketConnectInfrared](../WDLang3/3070018.md) to connect to this socket.
