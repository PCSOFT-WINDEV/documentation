## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000138"></a>
Starting with version 27, files can be downloaded in the background, using the system download manager. Therefore, it is no longer necessary to keep the application open to prompt the user to download a file. The download manager allows you to download large files and generate a notification when downloads are complete.

### Adding a download
<a name="adding_download_ELTPARAGRAPHE000016"></a>

To propose a download in your Android application: 

1. Define a download request with a variable of type [DownloadParameter](../WDLang3/1410087293.md). This variable contains multiple properties, but only one is really necessary: the **Source** property which corresponds to the URI of the file to download. 

2. Add the download in the download manager with [DownloadAdd](../WDLang3/1410087319.md). Once added, the download manager will start the download as soon as possible. 




**Remark: Download end procedure**
To be notified when a download is completed, you can specify a procedure that will be called at the end of the download. To do so, it is necessary to specify the procedure to call in the **ProcedureEnd** property of the [DownloadParameter](../WDLang3/1410087293.md) variable. 

- If the application was closed before the end of the download, it will be restarted to execute the procedure when the download is completed. 

- If the procedure returns <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>, the download will be deleted as well as the downloaded file. Otherwise, the download will be kept in the download manager and the file will not be deleted.





### Monitoring a download
<a name="monitoring_download_ELTPARAGRAPHE000044"></a>

To monitor the download in the Android application, retrieve the download details with [DownloadAdd](../WDLang3/1410087319.md), specifying the download identifier provided by [DownloadGetInfo](../WDLang3/1410087320.md). This information is stored in a variable of type [DownloadInfo](../WDLang3/1410087306.md).

If there is an error during the download, the download end procedure is started. The **Status** property of the [DownloadInfo](../WDLang3/1410087306.md) variable is set to *downloadStatusFailed*. In this case, the **StatusDetails** property can be used to determine the cause of the error. 

To retrieve all the downloads started by the application in the download manager, use [DownloadList](../WDLang3/1410087322.md).


### Removing a download

To remove a download from the download manager, use [DownloadRemove](../WDLang3/1410087321.md) and specify the identifier of the download to be removed. This function will cancel the download and remove it from the download manager, as well as the downloaded file, if it exists.

## WLanguage functions
<a name="wlanguage_functions_ELTTEXTE000198"></a>
The following WLanguage functions are used to manage downloads: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [DownloadAdd](../WDLang3/1410087319.md) | Adds a new download in the device's download manager. |
| [DownloadGetInfo](../WDLang3/1410087320.md) | Retrieves the details of a download present in the download manager. |
| [DownloadList](../WDLang3/1410087322.md) | Lists the downloads from the current application in the download manager. |
| [DownloadRemove](../WDLang3/1410087321.md) | Cancels a download by removing it from the download manager, and deletes any existing files. |





Remarks: 

- Using download functions automatically adds the INTERNET permission to the list of permissions required by the application. The DOWNLOAD_WITHOUT_NOTIFICATION permission is also added if the **downloadNotifNone** constant is used with the **NotificationMode** property of the [DownloadParameter](../WDLang3/1410087293.md) variable.

- When running the application in the simulator, download functions will have no effect.
