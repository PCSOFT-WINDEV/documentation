The folder must be found in the "Personal folders" branch.

During the call to **EmailRemoveFolder**, the following operations are automatically performed:

- the messages found in the folder to delete are moved into the bin ("Deleted elements" folder).

- the sub-folders of the folder to delete as well as their content are moved into the bin ("Deleted elements" folder).

- the folder to delete is permanently deleted.




If the folder to delete is already found in the bin, the folder and its content are permanently deleted.

**Reminder**: This function cannot be used to delete a folder from the Outlook Express messaging software.
