## Remarks


### Creating and drawing a chart through programming
<a name="creating_and_drawing_chart_through_programming_ELTPARAGRAPHE000056"></a>

To draw a chart:

- create the chart ([grCreate](../WDLang3/3042005.md)),

- add data ([grAddData](../WDLang3/3042023.md), [grStockAddData](../WDLang3/3042009.md) and [grScatterAddDataXY](../WDLang3/3042032.md)),

- define the chart destination ([grDestinationBMP](../WDLang3/3042018.md), [grDestinationControl](../WDLang3/3042020.md), [grDestinationEMF](../WDLang3/3042017.md), [grDestinationWnd](../WDLang3/3042031.md) and **grDestinationWMF**),

- draw the chart ([grDraw](../WDLang3/3042026.md)).

### WMF file for destination
<a name="wmf_file_for_destination_ELTPARAGRAPHE000097"></a>

- During the next call to [grDraw](../WDLang3/3042026.md), the chart will be drawn in the meta file named &lt;Name of Meta File&gt;.

- This file can be read by a tool that recognizes WMF format.

- The size of this meta file can be defined by [grWndSize](../WDLang3/3042016.md).

- We recommend that you preview the chart before it is saved in a file.

### Differences between grDestinationWMF and grSaveWMF
<a name="differences_between_grdestinationwmf_and_grsavewmf_ELTPARAGRAPHE000113"></a>

- **grDestinationWMF** is used to define the destination of the next chart drawing. When [grDraw](../WDLang3/3042026.md) is used, the chart will be drawn in the specified file and all the changes made since the chart was last drawn will be taken into account.

- [grSaveWMF](../WDLang3/3042044.md) is used to save the chart in a file in WMF format. The image saved corresponds to the chart during the last call to [grDraw](../WDLang3/3042026.md). The changes made to the chart since [grDraw](../WDLang3/3042026.md) was last called will be ignored.
