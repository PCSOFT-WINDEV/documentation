Changes the value of the "timeout" for connecting to the SMTP, POP3 and IMAP messaging servers. The value of the "timeout" is set to 10 minutes by default. This value is returned by [EmailGetTimeOut](../WDLang3/3032011.md).

**Reminder**: The timeout is the maximum amount of time allowed while waiting for a response from the messaging server. If the server does not respond within this time-out, the connection fails.

## Remarks


### Connection and timeout functions
<a name="connection_and_timeout_functions_ELTPARAGRAPHE000063"></a>

The connection functions ([EmailStartSession](../WDLang3/3032028.md), [EmailStartPOP3Session](../WDLang3/3032022.md) and [EmailStartSMTPSession](../WDLang3/3032025.md)) are locking functions during the entire connection. If the server does not respond, these functions are locking functions during the time-out duration.

**Remark**: The timeout value defined by **EmailSetTimeOut** represents the time passed to wait for the response from the messaging server. The real execution time of [EmailStartSession](../WDLang3/3032028.md), [EmailStartPOP3Session](../WDLang3/3032022.md) and [EmailStartSMTPSession](../WDLang3/3032025.md) can be greater than this value (for a slow DNS for example).
