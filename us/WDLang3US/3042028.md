Retrieves and/or modifies the value of the line thickness in a Line chart.

![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) **Caution**: A specific configuration is required to use this function in Linux. For more details, see [The charts](../WDChamp/3042060.md).

## Example


```wl
// Chart created through programming
// Modifies the line thickness for all the series of the chart
grLineThickness("MyChart", grAllSeries, 4)
```
<a name="Example2"></a>

```wl
// Chart control
// Modifies the line thickness for all the series of the chart
grLineThickness(CHART_MyChart, grAllSeries, 4)
```

## Syntax

### Retrieving the thickness of the line (Line chart)

`<Result> = grLineThickness(<Chart name> , <Series number>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**

Line thickness.

**`<Chart name>: (Control name or character string)`**

Name of the chart to be used. This name corresponds to:

- the chart name defined through programming with [grCreate](../WDLang3/3042005.md).

- the name of Chart control (found in the window editor or in the report editor).


This chart must be a Line chart.



**`<Series number>: (Integer)`**

Number of the series for which the line thickness is requested.  


<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Modifying the thickness of the line (Line chart)

`grLineThickness(<Chart name> , <Series number> , <New thickness>)`
---

**`<Chart name>: (Control name or character string)`**

Name of the chart to be used. This name corresponds to:

- the chart name defined through programming with [grCreate](../WDLang3/3042005.md).

- the name of Chart control (found in the window editor or in the report editor).


This chart must be a Line chart.



**`<Series number>: (Integer)`**



- Number of the series for which the line thickness must be modified. 

- *grAllSeries* constant to change the thickness of all the series (including the new ones).




**`<New thickness>: (Integer)`**

New thickness of the line. This parameter can correspond to a value greater than 0. The line thickness is set to 1 by default.

## Remarks


### Units taken into account for the thickness
<a name="units_taken_into_account_for_the_thickness_ELTPARAGRAPHE000176"></a>

The line thickness corresponds to values greater than or equal to 0.

- If the thickness corresponds to 0, the thickness will be 1 pixel on the screen (which means 1 pica when printing).

- If the thickness is greater than 1, the thickness will be x pixels on the screen, which means x picas when printing.



<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Miscellaneous
<a name="miscellaneous_ELTPARAGRAPHE000188"></a>

- No error is returned if **grLineThickness** is applied to a chart other than a Line chart. The information is stored and it will be used when the type of the chart is modified (by [grType](../WDLang3/3042062.md) or with the context menu of the chart).

- Equivalence: the **grLineThickness** function is equivalent to the [Thickness](../Proprietes/2510144.md) property.

- The data defined by **grLineThickness** will be taken into account during the next call to [grDraw](../WDLang3/3042026.md).
