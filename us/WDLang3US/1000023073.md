## Example


```wl
gMqttSession is mqttSession
...
lbResult is boolean
lbResult = MQTTSubscribe(gMqttSession, "sensors/sensor1/temperature1", mqttQualityAtLeastOnce, ...
	Proc_MQTTSubscribe)

// The procedure specified in MQTTSubscribe must be a project global procedure 
PROCEDURE Proc_MQTTSubscribe(pMqttSession is mqttSession, ...
	Topic is string, abuffer is Buffer)
		Trace("Subscription")
END
```

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = MQTTSubscribe(<MQTT session> , <Topic> , <Quality> , <Procedure>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the subscription is implemented,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. 




**`<MQTT session>: (mqttSession variable)`**

Name of the [mqttSession](../WDLang3/1000023023.md) variable corresponding to the MQTT session to be used. 

**`<Topic>: (Character string)`**

Topic for which the subscription is requested. 

**`<Quality>: (Integer constant)`**

Requested quality:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *mqttQualityAtLeastOnce* | The message will be delivered at least once. The client will transmit the message several times if necessary until the server (broker) confirms that the message was transmitted on the network. |
| *mqttQualityAtMostOnce* | The message will be delivered once at most. The message is not stored. It is sent without guarantee of receipt. The MQTT (broker) does not inform the sender that the message was received. The message can be lost if the client is disconnected or if the server is stopped. |
| *mqttQualityExactlyOnce* | The message will be necessarily saved by the issuer. It will be transmitted as long as the receiver does not confirm its sending on the network. The issuer is using a sophisticated recognition with the server (broker) to avoid duplicating messages. This mode is slower but it is more secure. |



**`<Procedure>: (Name of the WLanguage procedure)`**

Name of the WLanguage procedure ("callback") executed each time a new notification is received. 
**It must be a global procedure of the project**: using an internal procedure is not allowed. This procedure has the following format:

```txt
PROCEDURE <Procedure name>(<Connection> is mqttSession, 
<Topic> is string, <Message> is Buffer)
```
where: 

- &lt;Connection&gt; corresponds to a [mqttSession](../WDLang3/1000023023.md) variable containing the characteristics of MQTT session. 

- &lt;Topic&gt; corresponds to the message topic. 

- &lt;Message&gt; corresponds to the message content.
