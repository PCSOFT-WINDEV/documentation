## Principle
<a name="principle_ELTTEXTE000134"></a>
										
The management of the incoming calls is performed in a specific "thread". When an incoming call is detected, the procedure associated with the thread is run. The management of the call is performed in this procedure.

## Steps to follow
<a name="steps_follow_ELTTEXTE000158"></a>
To manage the incoming calls in a WINDEV or WINDEV Mobile application: 

1. Define (if necessary) the TAPI device on which the calls must be detected. Use the functions:
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [tapiCapability](../WDLang3/3076014.md) | Returns the characteristics of a telephony device. |
| [tapiDevice](../WDLang3/3076032.md) | Selects the TAPI device that will be used during the following telephony operations: <br><br>	- [tapiDial](../WDLang3/3076013.md),<br><br>	- [tapiListen](../WDLang3/3076029.md).<br><br><br> |
| [tapiDeviceList](../WDLang3/3076024.md) | Lists the TAPI 2.0 and TAPI 3.1 compatible devices installed on the current computer. |

2. Start the detection of incoming calls with [tapiListen](../WDLang3/3076029.md). This function runs a specific WLanguage procedure. This procedure will be automatically run when an incoming call is detected.

3. In this procedure, you can:

	- find out the status of the call via the following constants:

		- *tapiLineBusy*: The line is currently busy. 

		- *tapiLineConnected*: The line is connected. 

		- *tapiLineDialing*: Dialing in progress. 

		- *tapiLineDialTone*: The line gets a dial tone

		- *tapiLineDisconnected*: The correspondent has hung up

		- *tapiLineProceeding*: The call is dialed: searching for the correspondent

		- *tapiLineRingBack*: Ringing in progress

		- *tapiNewCall*: New call detected waiting for an answer or for a reject.

		- *tapiCallInformation*: The additional information (presentation of the number) is available. In most cases, this information will be available after the fist ring.




- manage the call via the following functions:

	- finding out the characteristics of the incoming call:
						

4. To end the session for detecting the incoming calls, use [tapiStopCallDetection](../WDLang3/3076022.md).

### Example used to manage the incoming calls in the main thread
<a name="example_used_manage_the_incoming_calls_the_main_thread_ELTPARAGRAPHE000068"></a>

- Code for declaring the global variables of the window used for call detection. The different events used to manage the calls in the main thread of the application are declared in this code.
	
	```wl
	GLOBAL 
	gnEventID is int 
	// Implement an event to manage the incoming calls in popup 
	IF Event("DetectedCall", "*.*", "PhoneCall") = 0 THEN 
		Error("Unable to manage the popup for call detection", ErrorInfo()) 
	END 
	IF Event("EndDetectedCall", "*.*", "EndPhoneCall") = 0 THEN 
		Error("Unable to manage the popup for call detection", ErrorInfo()) 
	END 
	IF Event("DetectedCallIdentifier", "*.*", "PhoneCallInfo") = 0 THEN 
		Error("Unable to manage the popup for call detection", ErrorInfo()) 
	END
	```


- Window initialization code: this code is used to start the procedure for call detection.
	
	```wl
	// Start the service for call detection 
	IF tapiListen("IncomingCall", tapiOptionMediaModeFax, "CallDetection") THEN 
		// The service for call detection is started 
		Message("Call detection enabled") 
	ELSE 
		// The service for call detection is not started 
		 Error("Unable to start the call detection" + CR + ...
				"Error details:"+ CR + ErrorInfo(errMessage)) 
	END
	```


- Procedure for call detection:
	This procedure is used to detect the incoming calls. 
	For each incoming call, the characteristics of the call are transmitted to the main thread by [PostMessage](../WDLang1/3015001.md).
	
	```wl
	PROCEDURE CallDetection(nServiceID, nCallID, nStatus) 
	// WARNING: 
	// The processes performed by this procedure are called from a thread 
	// The display should be done via the main thread
	// (this is why PostMessage is used) 
	// The "Trace" function must be used to debug this process 
	// detection of incoming calls 
	SWITCH nStatus 
		// Detect a new call: 
		// Note: Additional information will be available after the fist ring 
		CASE tapiNewCall: 
		  // Signal to the main window that a new call is arriving 
		  // to open a popup 
		  PostMessage(Handle(Window_Call), "PhoneCall", nCallID, nStatus) 
		  // Information about the call is available 
		CASE tapiCallInformation: 
		  // Signal to the main window that a new call is arriving 
		  // to open a popup 
		  PostMessage(Handle(Window_Call), "PhoneCallInfo", nCallID, nStatus) 
		  // The line was hung up 
		CASE tapiLineDisconnected: 
		  // Signal to the main window that a new call is arriving 
		  // to open a popup 
		  PostMessage(Handle(Window_Call), "PhoneCallEnd", nCallID, nStatus) 
	END
	```

Once contacts have been entered in the main window (the table is in edit), you will be able to call them from the application directly (your computer must be equipped with a modem properly installed). You will be able to get a notification for the incoming calls and to identify the caller
