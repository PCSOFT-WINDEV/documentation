Disables the detection of an event on a serial port. The event was managed by [sEvent](../WDLang3/3062014.md).

## Example


```wl
// Detect characters on COM1 port
sEvent(1, sEveCharReceived, "Read")
sEvent(1, sEveBreak, "Break")
...
sEndEvent(1, sEveBreak)
...

// --Procedure Read(PortNum, Event)
Trace(sRead(1, sInEntryQueue(1)))
```

## Syntax

`<Result> = sEndEvent(<Port number> [, <Event to stop>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the function was run,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise.




**`<Port number>: (Integer)`**



- Number of the serial port (1, 2, 3, up to 32 for COM1, COM2, COM3, ... COM32). 

- Port number returned by [sOpen](../WDLang3/3062013.md) (if this function was called with a port name).




**`<Event to stop>: (Optional Integer constant (or combination of constants))`**

Event whose management must be stopped. If this parameter is not specified, all the events managed on the port are disabled.

## Remarks




### Closing the port
<a name="closing_the_port_ELTPARAGRAPHE000127"></a>

When closing the port, all the events managed on this port are disabled. When re-opening the port, [sEvent](../WDLang3/3062014.md) must be re-run to define the events managed on this port.

### Using an external library: RXTX
<a name="using_external_library_rxtx_ELTPARAGRAPHE000266"></a>

In Java, the use of functions for handling the serial and parallel ports ([sOpen](../WDLang3/3062013.md), [sWrite](../WDLang3/3062009.md), [sRead](../WDLang3/3062012.md), ...) requires the presence of an external library: RXTX. 

This library includes a Jar archive and one or more native libraries that depend on the operating system on which the application is run.
 
To use these functions: 

- the Jar archive (RXTXComm.jar) must: 

	- be found in the same directory as the Java application generated by WINDEV, 

	- be found in the execution classpath of the application, 

	- be directly included in the generated application (from the wizard for Java generation). 




- the native libraries corresponding to the operating system on which the application is run must be found: 

	- in the same directory as the Java application generated by WINDEV, 

	- in the path of the application libraries (librarypath).







The RXTX library and its documentation can be downloaded from: [http://users.frii.com/jarvi/rxtx/index.html](http://users.frii.com/jarvi/rxtx/index.html) (link valid at the time this documentation was published). 

**Caution**: The management of infrared ports is not available in Java.
