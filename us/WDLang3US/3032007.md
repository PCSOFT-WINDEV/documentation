## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000249"></a>
WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile allow you to directly manage the emails from your applications. Sending and receiving emails are simplified by:

- [multiple WLanguage functions](../WDLang3/3032034.md),

- several advanced types used to easily handle several connections to servers and an important number of messages:

	- The [Email](../WDLang3/1000018713.md) and [emailAttach](../WDLang3/1000018752.md) types are used to manage the messages and their attachments.
			These types of variables replace the [email structure](../WDLang3/3032029.md), which is kept for compatibility.

	- The [emailPOP3Session](../WDLang3/1000018759.md), [emailSMTPSession](../WDLang3/1000018765.md), [emailNotesSession](../WDLang3/1000018768.md), [emailOutlookSession](../WDLang3/1000018767.md) and [emailIMAPSession](../WDLang3/1000018957.md) types are used to manage the connections to the messaging servers.







Remark: You also have the ability to handle the content of emails without sending them ([EmailBuildSource](../WDLang3/1000017225.md) and [EmailImportSource](../WDLang3/1000017226.md)).

## Managing emails
<a name="managing_emails_ELTTEXTE000273"></a>
Several methods can be used to manage emails:

- Management via the POP3, IMAP and SMTP protocols: 

	- **the POP3 protocol**: this ***protocol for receiving emails*** is recognized by all the service providers. This protocol allows you to directly communicate with the server, available at your ISP. This protocol is used to list and read incoming messages. 

	- **the IMAP protocol**: this ***protocol for receiving emails*** allows you to leave the emails on the server so that they can be viewed from different messaging clients or webmail. Several characteristics associated with the emails can be managed. 

	- **the SMTP protocol**: this ***protocol for sending emails*** is recognized by all the service providers. 







- Management via Lotus Notes, Outlook or MS Exchange: 

	- **the "Simple Mail API API (also called SMAPI or Simple MAPI)"**: this management mode of emails is used by most of the Microsoft applications and mainly the MS Exchange client.

	- **the Lotus Notes or Outlook messaging software**: these programs allow you to send and receive emails.







**Remarks**:

- ![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png)![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Only the POP3 and SMTP protocols are available.




- ![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) The SSL connections are not supported (for a secure POP3, SMTP or IMAP server).

## Two-factor authentication for emails
<a name="twofactor_authentication_for_emails_ELTTEXTE000297"></a>
More and more providers offer secure email accounts (SMTP/IMAP) with two-factor authentication.

Here is how it works: 

- Connect to the email provider using OAuth: this connection provides a token. 

- Use the token to connect to IMAP or SMTP email boxes.




Let's see an example of code that can be used:




```wl
// Example of IMAP connection with a Gmail account
// and two-factor authentication
OAuthGoogleCnt is OAuth2Parameters
gMyIMAPSession is emailIMAPSession

// IMAP server parameters
gMyIMAPSession.ServerAddress = "imap.gmail.com"
gMyIMAPSession.Option = optionSSL
MyIMAPSession.Port = "993"

// OAuth connection parameters
OAuthGoogleCnt.ClientID = "Application ID"
OAuthGoogleCnt.ClientSecret = "Secret application ID"
OAuthGoogleCnt.AuthURL = "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth"
OAuthGoogleCnt.TokenURL = "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token"
OAuthGoogleCnt.Scope = "https://mail.google.com/"
OAuthGoogleCnt.RedirectionURL = "http://localhost:9000"
OAuthGoogleCnt.ResponseType = "code"

// OAuth authentication

gMyIMAPSession.AuthToken = AuthIdentify(OAuthGoogleCnt)

// If the authentication was successful, log in to email inbox.
IF gMyIMAPSession.AuthToken <> Null THEN
	IF EmailStartSession(gMyIMAPSession) THEN
	// Session started
	ELSE
	// Error starting the session.
	END
ELSE
	// Authentication error.
END
```
