Returns the number of incoming messages currently found:

- on the email server (POP3 and IMAP protocol). 

	- POP3 protocol: This number of messages remains constant during the entire email session, even if new emails are received or if emails are deleted by [EmailDeleteMessage](../WDLang3/3032027.md).

	- IMAP protocol: This number of messages evolves according to the incoming emails or to the emails actually deleted from the email server (via an "expunge" commande, clear the bin from a WebMail for example). You also have the ability to force the destruction of all deleted emails via [EmailExpunge](../WDLang3/1000021553.md).




- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) in the Outlook messaging software. This number of messages evolves according to the emails received or deleted by [EmailDeleteMessage](../WDLang3/3032027.md).

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) in the Notes messaging software. This number of messages evolves according to the emails received or deleted by [EmailDeleteMessage](../WDLang3/3032027.md).

## Syntax

### Finding out the number of emails found on the email server (POP3 protocol)

`<Result> = EmailNbMessage(<POP3 session>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**



- Number of messages received on the server at the beginning of current email session,

- -1 if an error occurred. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md).




**`<POP3 session>: (Character string)`**

Identifies the user session (POP3). This parameter can correspond to:

- the username that was used to start the email session ([EmailStartSession](../WDLang3/3032028.md)).  

- a variable of type [emailPOP3Session](../WDLang3/1000018759.md).

## Remarks


### Deleted messages (POP3 protocol)
<a name="deleted_messages_pop3_protocol_ELTPARAGRAPHE000272"></a>

If a message was deleted by [EmailDeleteMessage](../WDLang3/3032027.md):

- **EmailNbMessage** returns the number of messages on the email server before they are deleted. 

- the message numbers are not re-assigned.




Therefore, if four messages are found on the server at the beginning of session, these messages are numbered from 1 to 4. If message #1 is deleted:

- **EmailNbMessage** used in the same session always returns 4.

- Message 1 cannot be read by [EmailReadMessage](../WDLang3/3032016.md) because the message does not exist anymore (only messages 2, 3 and 4 exist).




The message numbers are re-assigned during the next connection.

### Deleted messages (Outlook messaging)
<a name="deleted_messages_outlook_messaging_ELTPARAGRAPHE000305"></a>

If a message was deleted by [EmailDeleteMessage](../WDLang3/3032027.md) in the same email session, **EmailNbMessage** returns the actual number of messages in the inbox folder.
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Deleted messages (IMAP protocol)
<a name="deleted_messages_imap_protocol_ELTPARAGRAPHE000319"></a>

If a message was deleted by [EmailDeleteMessage](../WDLang3/3032027.md), this message is actually deleted from the session: 

- during the next "expunge" command (clear the bin from a WebMail for example).

- when using [EmailExpunge](../WDLang3/1000021553.md) to force all the deleted emails to be destroyed.



<a name="NOTE0_5"></a>


### New messages (POP3 protocol)
<a name="new_messages_pop3_protocol_ELTPARAGRAPHE000339"></a>

The POP3 protocol cannot be used to find out and manage the new messages received during the connection. To get the new messages, you must disconnect ([EmailCloseSession](../WDLang3/3032006.md)) and reconnect ([EmailStartSession](../WDLang3/3032028.md)).
