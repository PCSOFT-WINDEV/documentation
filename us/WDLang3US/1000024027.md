The **URI** (Uniform Resource Identifier) type identifies physical or abstract resources (e.g. files or Web pages). 

There are two types of URIs: 

- **URL**s (Uniform Resource Locator): identify a resource through its location and the means to access it. 
	Examples: 

	- Web address: https://www.windev.com/windevmobile/index.html

	- Location of a file on disk: file:///C:/Users/johndoe/Documents/log.txt




- **URN**s (Uniform Resource Name): identify a resource by its name. They do not make it possible to locate the resource but must remain unique and persist even if the resource no longer exists or becomes unavailable. 
	Example: ISBN number: urn:isbn:0-395-36341-1 




A URI can be represented as a character string whose syntax complies with the standard defined by RFC 3986. Each URI can contain up to five parts:

```txt
<scheme>: [//<authority>]<path>[? <query>] [ # <fragment> ]
```


- The **URI scheme** is a letter followed by any combination of letters, numbers, plus sign (+), period (.) or dash (-) and ends with a colon (:). In the case of a URL, it generally corresponds to the protocol to be used to access the resource: http, https, ftp, etc.

- The **authority** of the URI is an optional part that corresponds to the identification information to access the resource. Its format is usually: 
	
	```txt
	[<user>[:<password>]]host[:<port>]
	```


- The **path** is a sequence of segments separated by slashes (/). In the case of a URL on a Web page for example, it represents the path to the resource on the host.

- The **request** is an optional part preceded by a*?* and followed by a set of pairs ' key=value' separated by '&'. In the case of a URL on a web page for example, it allows you to pass named parameters to the page.

- The **fragment** is an optional part preceded by a '#' that allows providing additional information to access a secondary resource (page number, anchor of an HTML page, etc.).

### Properties specific to URI variables
<a name="properties_specific_uri_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000081"></a>

The following properties can be used to handle a URI variable:

| Property name | Type used | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Authority | Character string | <br><br>- "Authority" part of the URI,<br><br>- Empty string if not specified.<br><br><br>This property is available in read and write mode. |
| Fragment | Character string | <br><br>- Fragment of the URI,<br><br>- Empty string if not specified.<br><br><br>This property is available in read and write mode. |
| Host | Character string | <br><br>- Host of the URI,<br><br>- Empty string if not specified.<br><br><br>This property is available in read and write mode.<br><br>Caution: If the **Host** property is modified: <br><br>- the **User** and **Password** properties are reset: you need to assign a value to these two properties. <br><br>- the **Port** property is reset: a value has to be assigned to the **Port** property as well. <br><br><br> |
| Path | Character string | Path of the URI.<br><br>This property is available in read and write mode. |
| Port | Integer | <br><br>- Port number (between 1 and 65365),<br><br>- 0 if not specified.<br><br><br><br><br>This property is available in read and write mode. |
| Query | Character string | <br><br>- Query found in the URI,<br><br>- Empty string if not specified.<br><br><br><br><br>This property is available in read and write mode. |
| Scheme | Character string | Scheme found in the URI.<br><br>If changes are made, this property is mandatory and cannot be empty.<br><br>This property is available in read and write mode. |
| User | Character string | Username.<br><br>This property is available in read and write mode. |
| UserPassword | Character string | <br><br>- User password, <br><br>- Empty string if not specified.<br><br><br><br><br>This property is available in read and write mode. |
| Value | Character string | Complete URI. |


You can use [VariableReset](../WDLang1/3013069.md) to reset the contents of a variable of type **URI**.
