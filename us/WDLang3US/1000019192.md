The following functions are used to handle geolocation data and to control GPS devices:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [geoAzimuth](../WDLang3/1000019212.md) | Returns the direction represented by a location in relation to another one. |
| [geoDistance](../WDLang3/1000019211.md) | Returns the distance between the two locations. This distance is expressed in meters by default. |
| [geoGetAddress](../WDLang3/1000019797.md) | Retrieves an address or a list of addresses corresponding to the description of a geographic location. |
| [geoGetArea](../WDLang3/1000025776.md) | Retrieves the coordinates of the geographic area that corresponds to a given description. |
| [geoRunApp](../WDLang3/1000019954.md) | Starts the device's native maps application to display: <br><br>- a specific geographical location, <br><br>- a route between two locations.<br><br><br> |
| [geoTrackingDisable](../WDLang3/1000021584.md) | Disables the tracking of user positions for a WINDEV Mobile application. |
| [geoTrackingEnable](../WDLang3/1000021583.md) | Enables the management of location tracking in a WINDEV Mobile application. |
| [geoTrackingProcedure](../WDLang3/1000021585.md) | Defines the WLanguage procedure that will be called when the location of the user changes. |
| [geoTrackingStatus](../WDLang3/1000021592.md) | Retrieves the status of the system for position tracking. |
| [GPSDetectPosition](../WDLang3/1000019209.md) | Asks to be notified when the device gets close to a given location. |
| [GPSEnd](../WDLang3/1000019210.md) | Indicates the end of the use of geolocation functions. |
| [GPSFollowMovement](../WDLang3/1000019206.md) | Requests to be notified periodically of the device's current location. |
| [GPSGetPosition](../WDLang3/1000019205.md) | Retrieves information about the current device position. |
| [GPSInfo](../WDLang3/1000019208.md) | Returns the information about the location provider used by the application for geolocation functions. |
| [GPSInitParameter](../WDLang3/1000019204.md) | Initializes the parameters of geolocation WLanguage functions and finds a location provider. |
| [GPSLastPosition](../WDLang3/1000019239.md) | Retrieves the information about the last known device position. |
| [GPSStatus](../WDLang3/1000019207.md) | Retrieves the activation status of the geolocation provider or asks to be notified when the status changes. |
| [GPSStopDetection](../WDLang3/1000019240.md) | Stops the location detection triggered by [GPSDetectPosition](../WDLang3/1000019209.md). |





The following advanced types are used to handle geolocation data:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [Address](../WDLang3/1000019944.md) | The **Address** type is used to manipulate the address of a place or person. |
| [geoPosition](../WDLang3/1000019191.md) | The **geoPosition** type is used to handle geographic positions via WLanguage geolocation functions. |
