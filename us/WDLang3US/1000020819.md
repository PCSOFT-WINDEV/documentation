Sends a push notification to a mobile device (iOS or Android). This function can be used in a WINDEV application or in a WEBDEV site. 
<a name="Example1"></a>
<a name="sample_code"></a>

## Example


```wl
// Envoi d'une notification push sur iOS
TokensEnvoi est un tableau de Buffers
MonMotDePasse est une chaine ANSI = "Password"

POUR i = 1 A nbTokens
	Ajoute(TokensEnvoi, tokens[i])
FIN 

MaNotification est une Notification
MaNotification.Message = "Nouvelle notification"

MonRésultat est un booléen 
MonRésultat = NotifPushEnvoie(MaNotification, TokensEnvoi, ...
		"certifapple.cer", MonMotDePasse, NomBundleID, typeServiceIOSProd)

SI MonRésultat = Faux ALORS
	Trace(ErreurInfo())
FIN
```

### iPhone/iPad: Sending a notification

`<Result> = NotifPushSend(<Notification> , <Tokens> , <Identification> , <Password> , <TopicID> , <Server type>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the sending was successful,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) is used to identify the error returned by the notification service. 




**`<Notification>: (Notification)`**

Name of the [Notification](../WDLang3/1000019441.md) variable corresponding to the notification to send. 

**`<Tokens>: (Array of buffers)`**

Name of Array variable containing the list of tokens representing the devices onto which the notification will be sent. 

**`<Identification>: (Character string)`**

Full path of the file containing the certificate for the application push notifications (obtained from Apple). For more details, see [Conditions required for the Push notifications in iOS](../WDLang3/1000021032.md). 

**`<Password>: (ANSI character string)`**

Password of the file containing the certificate for Push notifications. If the file does not have a password, use an empty string (""). This parameter must correspond to an ANSI character string. 

**`<TopicID>: (Character string)`**

Bundle identifier specified in the "General" section of the Xcode project generation wizard. 

**`<Server type>: (Integer constant)`**

Type of server onto which the notification will be sent: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *typeServiceIOSRelease* | Server of IOS release (APN). |
| *typeServiceIOSTest* | Server of IOS test (APN). |

### Android: Sending a notification 

`<Result> = NotifPushSend(<Notification> , <Tokens> , <Identification> , <Invalid tokens> [, <Platform>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the sending was successful,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) is used to identify the error returned by the notification service. These errors can contain a list of invalid tokens that must be deleted from the token database.




**`<Notification>: (Notification)`**

Name of the [Notification](../WDLang3/1000019441.md) variable corresponding to the notification to send. 

**`<Tokens>: (Array of buffers)`**

Name of the Array variable containing the list of tokens representing the devices to which the notification will be sent. 

**`<Identification>: (Character string)`**

Application ID parameter: 

- on the GCM service: Google authorization key. 
	A specific configuration is required to get this key. For more details, see [Configuration required for Push notifications in Android](../WDLang3/1000021022.md). 

- on the Firebase platform, with API Cloud Messaging: Google authorization key. 
	A specific configuration is required to get this key. For more details, see [Configuration required for Push notifications in Android](../WDLang3/1000022215.md). 

- on the Firebase platform, with API Firebase Cloud Messaging V1: content of the JSON file corresponding to the private key of the service account. 
	To obtain this JSON file, a specific configuration is necessary. For more details, see [Configuration required for Push notifications in Android](../WDLang3/1000022215.md). 




**`<Invalid tokens>: (Array of buffers)`**

Name of the Array of Buffers variable. This parameter is filled with the list of invalid tokens returned by the server. 



**`<Platform>: (Optional Integer constant)`**

Platform that will be used to send the notification. The Android application that will receive he notifications must have been configured for this type of platform.

| *npeFirebase* | Firebase platform using API Cloud Messaging. <br>Platform for sending Notification push available from WINDEV 22 Update 1. This platform is always available: <br><br>- for existing Firebase projects already using this solution. <br><br>- for new Firebase projects, if this API is activated. <br><br><br> |
| *npeFirebaseCM_v1* | Firebase platform using API Firebase Cloud Messaging V1. <br>New platform for sending Notification push enabled by Default for new Firebase projects. <br>This platform must be used from WINDEV 28 Update 2 for projects using API Firebase Cloud Messaging V1. |
| *npeGCM*<br>(Default value) | Google Cloud Messaging platform. <br>Former Google solution for sending push notifications. <br>This platform should only be used for existing projects already using push notifications (projects created with versions earlier than WINDEV 22 Update 1) |

## Remarks


- The push notification is sent to a notification service (Apple or Google) that redistributes this notification to a set of mobile devices. 

- The supported services are: 

	- Google Firebase (Google GCM is supported for backward compatibility. Firebase is recommended by Google).

		- API Firebase Cloud Messaging V1

		- API Cloud Messaging




- Apple APN. 

- The notifications sent to the Android devices take into account the proxy defined by [Proxy](../WDLang3/3043002.md). 

- **Starting with Android 8**, notifications sent to Android devices take into account the notification category (also called "Channel"). 

- **Specific features for iOS**: 

	- The notifications sent to the devices running iOS are direct (they do not transit via the proxy).

	- The Apple service allows 256 bytes of data per notification only. Therefore, pay attention to the amount of data sent in the [Notification](../WDLang3/1000019441.md) variable (the message for example) to avoid exceeding this limit. An error will occur if the limit is exceeded.

	- The connection to the APN server may fail if two notifications are sent in a very short time interval (if the server is still processing the first message).

	- To send push notifications on the iOS devices, the application must be able to access the ports 2195 and 2196 in TCP.
