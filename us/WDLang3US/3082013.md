## Syntax

`<Result> = zipCreateExe(<Archive> , <Executable path> [, <Extraction options> [, <Executable icon> [, <Default extraction directory> [, <Translation of self-extracting program>]]]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**



- 0 if the executable was created,

- An error code (value greater than 0) otherwise. For more details on these error codes, see the [Remarks](#NOTE0_1).




**`<Archive>: (Character string or zipArchive variable)`**

Name of the archive to be used.
This name can correspond to:

- the name of an archive, defined by [zipOpen](../WDLang3/3082044.md) or [zipCreate](../WDLang3/3082003.md).

- the name of a variable of type [zipArchive](../WDLang3/1000018679.md).




**`<Executable path>: (Character string)`**

Path of executable to create (up to 260 characters). This path can be a path relative to the current directory or a full path. 
The .EXE extension is mandatory.

**`<Extraction options>: (Optional constant)`**

Extraction options to use: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *zipAdministrator* | Forces the created executable to be run as administrator. This mode is used to avoid the virtualization of files from Windows Vista. |
| *zipCurrentDirectory* | All the archive files will be extracted into the current directory. |
| *zipDefaultDir* | Uses the default directory (&lt;Default extraction directory>). |
| *zipSelectRestorePath* | The self-extracting program will display the "Keep the tree structure" check box in the dialog box. |
| *zipTempDirectory*<br>(Default value) | The archive files will be extracted from the temporary directory of the computer where the executable is run. All the files are extracted into the same location. |
| *zipTree* | The archive files will be extracted according to the tree structure of directories found in the archive. |
| *zipWithUI* | The self-extracting program will display a dialog box allowing the user to chose the destination directory. |



**`<Executable icon>: (Optional character string)`**

Path of the icon file representing the created executable. This path can correspond to a path relative to the current path or to a full path. 
If this parameter is not specified, a default icon will be assigned to the executable.

**`<Default extraction directory>: (Optional character string)`**

Directory proposed by default by the decompression window (if the *zipWithGUI* constant is proposed). If no extraction interface is proposed, this directory will be used by default to extract the archive files.

**`<Translation of self-extracting program>: (Optional character string)`**

Full path of file (INI format) that contains the translation of messages for the self-extracting program. The format of this file is presented in details in the Notes.

## Remarks


### Use condition
<a name="use_condition_ELTPARAGRAPHE000132"></a>

A self-extracting archive can be created only if:

- The archive exists (archives are created using [zipCreate](../WDLang3/3082003.md)).

- The archive is accessible in read/write.

- The archive is a single-part archive.




**Caution**: 

- **Archives in "CAB" format**: This function is not available.

- **Archives in "RAR" format**: This function is not available.

- **Archives in "7z" format**: This function is not available.

- **Archives in "TAR" and "TARGZ" format**: This function is not available.



<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Error codes
<a name="error_codes_ELTPARAGRAPHE000155"></a>

The following error codes are returned:

- 10: Insufficient space to create the executable or the user has no write rights on the initial archive (.WDZ).

- 11: Error converting archive to self-extracting archive.

- 12: Insufficient space to create the executable or the user has no read rights on the initial archive (.WDZ).




The message corresponding to the error code is returned by [zipMsgError](../WDLang3/3082034.md).
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Stored path of archive files
<a name="stored_path_archive_files_ELTPARAGRAPHE000173"></a>

When the files are extracted from a self-extracting archive, the stored path of the files is not kept. Only the name and the extension of the files are stored.
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Self-extracting archive
<a name="selfextracting_archive_ELTPARAGRAPHE000182"></a>

A self-extracting archive from a WINDEV archive can be opened with [zipOpen](../WDLang3/3082044.md) and be used like any other archive.

The source archive (.WDZ or .ZIP) cannot be rebuilt from a self-extracting archive.

No password can be defined for a self-extracting archive.

**Caution**: 

- A self-extracting archive in ZIP format cannot be opened by [zipOpen](../WDLang3/3082044.md).

- If the self-extracting archive contains empty and non-empty sub-directories, when decompressing the archive, only the directories that contain a file are re-created. 



<a name="NOTE0_5"></a>


### Closing the archive
<a name="closing_the_archive_ELTPARAGRAPHE000206"></a>

Once **zipCreateExe** has been used on an archive, this archive is not closed. You must call [zipClose](../WDLang3/3082005.md) to close the source archive.
<a name="NOTE0_6"></a>


### Translating the interface of the self-extracting program (&lt;Translation of self-extracting program&gt; parameter)
<a name="translating_the_interface_the_selfextracting_program_parameter_ELTPARAGRAPHE000220"></a>

By default, the self-extracting program comes in three languages: English, Spanish and French. The self-extracting program will use the language of the executable or the language specified by [Nation](../WDLang1/3054014.md).  

The interface of the self-extracting program can use a language other than the default language (English).
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=zipcreeExe%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)
To do so, create a .INI file containing the following information:


```txt
[GENERAL]
NATIONDEFAUT=1
[WDAUTOEX01]
R000=Self-extracting PC SOFT archive
R001=Extract the content of the archive in the directory:
R002=Keep the tree structure
R003=Extract
R004=Close
```
For example, to get an interface in French:


```txt
[GENERAL]
NATIONDEFAUT=1
[WDAUTOEX01]
R000=Archive Autoextractible PC SOFT
R001=Extraire le contenu de l'archive dans le repertoire:
R002=Conserver l'arborescence 
R003=Extraire
R004=Fermer
```
**Caution**: The first three lines of this file must not be modified.

In the following lines, specify the desired translation.

The "Translation of self-extracting program" parameter must correspond to the path of the .INI file containing the translation of the interface.
<a name="NOTE0_7"></a>


### The executable is found on a media from which the archive files cannot be extracted
<a name="the_executable_found_media_from_which_the_archive_files_cannot_extracted_ELTPARAGRAPHE000246"></a>The executable may be found on a media (CD for example) from which the archived files cannot be extracted. In this case, run the executable and specify in the command line:


```txt
/DIR=<Directory>
```
The &lt;Directory&gt; parameter specifies the location from which the archive files must be extracted. If the &lt;Directory&gt; parameter contains space characters, the character string must be enclosed in quotes.

This parameter has priority over the &lt;Extraction directory&gt; parameter.
<a name="NOTE0_8"></a>


### The self-extracting archive contains executable files
<a name="the_selfextracting_archive_contains_executable_files_ELTPARAGRAPHE000260"></a>

If the last archived file is an executable (.EXE), this file will be automatically run once all the archive files have been extracted.
<a name="NOTE0_9"></a>


### Command line parameters of a self-extracting archive
<a name="command_line_parameters_selfextracting_archive_ELTPARAGRAPHE000269"></a>

The following parameters are used to launch a self-extracting archive from the command line: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| /DIR=&lt;Directory&gt; | Used to specify where the archived files should be extracted from. If the &lt;Directory&gt; contains space characters, the character string must be enclosed in quotes.<br><br>Caution: This parameter has priority over the parameter &lt;Extraction directory&gt; specified with **zipCreateExe**. |
| /TIT=&lt;Title&gt; | &lt;Title&gt; corresponds to the title of the self-extracting window. |
| /PID=&lt;Num PID&gt; | Used to wait for the end of the &lt;PID Num&gt; process before starting the extraction. |
| /SILENT | Used to start the extraction without a progress bar or a dialogue. |
| /WAIT | If the self-extracting archive starts an executable, the first window will remain opened until the end of the executable. |
| /RELANCE | Extraction with administrator rights. |
