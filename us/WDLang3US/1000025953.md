The list of Modbus functions is as follows: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [ModbusConnectRTU](../WDLang3/1000025929.md) | Connects a client to a Modbus slave via a serial port. |
| [ModbusConnectTCP](../WDLang3/1000025930.md) | Connects a client to a Modbus server via transmission control protocol (TCP). |
| [ModbusDisconnect](../WDLang3/1000025931.md) | Closes the Modbus session. |
| [ModbusReadBit](../WDLang3/1000025935.md) | Reads one or more bits from a Modbus slave, starting at a specific address. |
| [ModbusReadFloat](../WDLang3/1000025936.md) | Reads one or more single-precision floats from a Modbus slave, starting at a specific address. |
| [ModbusReadRegister](../WDLang3/1000025937.md) | Reads one or more registers from a Modbus slave, starting at a specific address. |
| [ModbusSendRawFrame](../WDLang3/1410089145.md) | Sends a raw frame to a Modbus slave. This enables communication with devices that do not strictly comply with the Modbus standard. |
| [ModbusWriteBit](../WDLang3/1000025932.md) | Writes one or multiple bits to a specific address in a Modbus slave. |
| [ModbusWriteFloat](../WDLang3/1000025933.md) | Writes one or more single-precision floats to a Modbus slave, starting at a specific address. |
| [ModbusWriteRegister](../WDLang3/1000025934.md) | Writes one or more registers (16-bit values) to a Modbus slave, starting at a specific address. |
