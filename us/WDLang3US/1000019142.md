## Example


```wl
// Create a SaaS site with a database for each client
S is saasSite
CtSite is Connection

S.Nom = "Forum"

IF SaaSAdminAddSite(S) = True THEN
	CtSite.Server = "localhost"
	CtSite.Provider = hAccessHFClientServer
	CtSite.User = "admin"
	CtSite.Password = "secret"
	CtSite.Database = "ForumDatabase"

	IF SaaSAdminConfigureSiteData(S, saasBaseClient, CtSite) = True THEN
		Info("The site was created and configured.")
	END
END

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = SaaSAdminConfigureSiteData(<SaaS site> , <Data management mode> [, <Connection parameters>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the modification was performed,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md).




**`<SaaS site>: (saasSite variable or character string)`**

Site (or name of site) for which the data management must be configured.

**`<Data management mode>: (Integer constant)`**

Management mode of data, the possible values are:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *saasBaseClient* | The site is using a single database shared between all client accounts. |
| *saasBaseCommon* | The site is using a database for each client account. This database is created by duplicating a default database. |
| *saasBaseNone* | The site is not using any database. |



**`<Connection parameters>: (Optional Connection variable)`**

Depending on the management mode:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| No database | &lt;Connection parameter&gt; is not required; it will be ignored if it is specified. |
| Database for each client account | &lt;Connection Parameter&gt; indicates the parameters for connecting to the default database. |
| Common database | &lt;Connection Parameter&gt; indicates the parameters for connecting to the common database. |

## Remarks
If the site was already configured in a database management (example: a database per client), we advise you not to change this management mode. Indeed, the configuration of data is not retroactive. The clients who are already subscribers will keep their database. To modify the connection parameters retroactively, the data management must be modified for each client by [SaaSAdminModifyClientConnection](../WDLang3/1000019143.md).

For a management mode with one database per client, the databases will be automatically created on the same server as the reference database. Their name will be built with the name of the site and the name of the client (for example: ECommerce_Hybrid). A user dedicated to the use of the database by the client will be created.
