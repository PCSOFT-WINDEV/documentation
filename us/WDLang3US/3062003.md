|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [sClose](../WDLang3/3062010.md) | Closes the specified serial port, parallel port or infrared port. |
| [sEndEvent](../WDLang3/3062008.md) | Disables the detection of an event on a serial port. |
| [sEscape](../WDLang3/3062006.md) | Runs different functions that directly affect the bits of serial port, parallel port or infrared port, independently of the communication protocol. |
| [sEvent](../WDLang3/3062014.md) | Branches an event on a serial port. |
| [sInEntryQueue](../WDLang3/3062004.md) | Retrieves the number of pending bytes in the input buffer of a specified serial port or infrared port. |
| [sInExitQueue](../WDLang3/3062005.md) | Retrieves the number of bytes waiting to be transferred in the output buffer of the specified serial port or parallel port. |
| [sListPort](../WDLang3/1000025980.md) | Returns the list of serial and parallel ports on the computer. |
| [sOpen](../WDLang3/3062013.md) | Opens and initializes:<br><br>- a serial port.<br><br>- a parallel port.<br><br>- an infrared port.<br><br><br> |
| [sParameter](../WDLang3/3062011.md) | Defines or modifies the parameters for configuring the specified serial port, parallel port or infrared port. |
| [sRead](../WDLang3/3062012.md) | Reads a character string in the entry buffer of the specified serial port. |
| [sWrite](../WDLang3/3062009.md) | Writes a character string to the output buffer of the specified serial port, parallel port or infrared port. |
