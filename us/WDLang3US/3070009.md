Allows the server to get information about the current client socket. The current client socket corresponds to the last socket whose message was read by [SocketRead](../WDLang3/3070014.md). 

This function can be used on a server of sockets. This allows you to find out whether a user connected via the socket and to check the validity of connection. 

Remarks:

- **UDP sockets**: Allows the server to get information about the socket whose last message was read by [SocketRead](../WDLang3/3070014.md).






**Reminder**: A socket is a communication resource used by applications to communicate from one computer to another regardless of the type of network.

## Example


```wl
// Add the incoming messages into a table
TableAdd(TABLE_IncomingMsg, "1" + TAB + SocketRead("Server", False) + ...
	TAB + SocketClientInfo("server", SocketAddress) + ...
	TAB + SocketClientInfo("server", SocketPort))
```



```wl
EDT_SentenceReceivedFromComputerB = SocketRead("ComputerA", False, 2000)
IF EDT_SentenceReceivedFromComputerB <> "" THEN
	Info("Message received from IP address # " + SocketClientInfo("ComputerA", SocketAddress))
END
```

- Requested information.

- Empty string in case of problem. 




**`<Socket name>: (Character string)`**

Name of socket defined on the server. This name was defined by [SocketCreate](../WDLang3/3070011.md) (for a simplified server) or by [SocketAccept](../WDLang3/3070004.md) (for a standard server).

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Caution: The socket name is case sensitive.

### Reading the port number
<a name="reading_the_port_number_ELTPARAGRAPHE000091"></a>

When a server is created on a port, a communication channel is created for each new connected client. This communication channel is using a port, chosen by the system among the available ports. **SocketClientInfo** returns the port number used by the communication channel.
