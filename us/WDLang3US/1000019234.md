<a name="description"></a>
Adds or modifies a cookie in an HTTP request. 

Two types of use are available: 

- If the request is run by [HTTPRequest](../WDLang3/3043007.md), **HTTPCookieWrite** must be called before [HTTPRequest](../WDLang3/3043007.md) in order to set the value of cookies that will be sent to the HTTP server.

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) If the request is executed with [HTTPSend](../WDLang3/1000021183.md), **HTTPCookieWrite** must be executed on the httpRequest variable (syntax 2). 


**Remark**: The cookies read and sent by [HTTPRequest](../WDLang3/3043007.md) are only stored in memory in the application. They are not related to the cookies of Web browsers installed on the computer.

### Request run by HTTPRequest

`HTTPCookieWrite(<Domain> , <Name> , <Value>)`

**`<Domain>: (Character string)`**

Validity domain of cookie.

The cookie will be sent into all HTTP requests whose domain ends with the validity domain of cookie.

For example, a cookie whose validity domain is ".mydomain.fr" will be sent during the following requests:

- http://mydomain.fr

- http://www.mydomain.fr/index.html

- http://server.mydomain.fr/page.awp


It will not be sent in the following requests:

- http://www.mydomain.com

- http://otherdomain.fr




**`<Name>: (Character string)`**

Name of cookie.

This name is not case sensitive.

**`<Value>: (Character string)`**

Value of cookie.

Remarks:

- The value of a cookie is limited to 4KB. Beyond this size, the server is free to reject the cookie.

- The control characters (TAB, CR, etc.) as well as the semicolon and the binary zeros are not allowed.
