## Syntax

### Finding out the different times associated with the last file viewed

`<Result> = FTPTime([<Type of time>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Character string)`**



- Time (in HHMMSS format) associated with the last file accessed by one of the following FTP functions: [FTPAttribute](../WDLang3/3040006.md), [FTPDate](../WDLang3/3040015.md), [FTPSize](../WDLang3/3040007.md), [FTPListFile](../WDLang3/3040018.md).

- Empty string ("") if an error occurred. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) with the *errMessage* constant.


![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Modification time of last file viewed.

Unlike the syntax 2, no request is sent to the server. Therefore, this syntax is recommended whenever possible.

**`<Type of time>: (Optional constant)`**

Indicates the time to use:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *ftpAccess* | Time of last access to the file. |
| *ftpCreation* | Time of file creation. |
| *ftpModification*<br>(Default value) | Time of last modification made to the file. |


![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This parameter is not available. Only the time of modification made to the last file viewed is available.

### Finding out the different times associated with the specified file

`<Result> = FTPTime(<Connection identifier> , <File name> [, <Type of time>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Character string)`**



- Time associated with the specified file (in HHMMSS format), 

- Empty string ("") if an error occurred. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) with the *errMessage* constant.


![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Modification time of specified file.

**`<Connection identifier>: (Integer)`**

Connection identifier, returned by [FTPConnect](../WDLang3/3040016.md).


**`<File name>: (Character string)`**

Name and full (or relative) path of the file be accessed. The different path sections are separated by "slashes" ("/").

**`<Type of time>: (Optional constant)`**

Indicates the time to use:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *ftpAccess* | Time of last access to the file. |
| *ftpCreation* | Time of file creation. |
| *ftpModification*<br>(Default value) | Time of last modification made to the file. |


![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This parameter is not available. Only the time of modification made to the specified file is available.

## Remarks


### Timeout
<a name="timeout_ELTPARAGRAPHE000148"></a>

By default, all the FTP functions fail if the FTP server does not respond within 20 seconds. This timeout can be modified with [FTPConnect](../WDLang3/3040016.md) when connecting to the FTP server.
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Rights of users
<a name="rights_users_ELTPARAGRAPHE000158"></a>

Only a user who has read rights on the FTP server can get information about the files or the directories found on an FTP server. In most cases, the read rights are granted to the "anonymous" users.
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Relative and absolute path
<a name="relative_and_absolute_path_ELTPARAGRAPHE000165"></a>

The notions of relative path and absolute path are very important in an FTP application.

- A path starting with a slash is considered as being an **absolute path**: it is the path in relation to the root of the FTP server (parameter specific to the server).
	Example: /ad/user/JULIA

- A path not starting with a slash is considered as being a **relative path**, which means a path given in relation to the current directory. This current directory can be returned or modified by [FTPCurrentDir](../WDLang3/3040003.md).


When connecting to an FTP site, the initial directory (the "home directory" of the user) is not necessarily found at the root of the FTP server. Therefore, we recommend that you use relative paths.
