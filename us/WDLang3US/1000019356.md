## Example


```wl
MyList is string
nID is int  
sSSID is string

MyList = WiFiListNetwork()
FOR EACH STRING Network of MyList SEPARATED BY CR
	nId = Val(ExtractString(Network, 1 , TAB)
	sSSID = ExtractString(Network, 2, TAB)
	...

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = WiFiListNetwork()`
---

**`<Result>: (Character string)`**

List of networks separated by CR characters (Carriage Return) and sorted by priority order (from the one with the highest priority to the one with the lower priority). The network with the highest priority is the one chosen by the device to connect in Wi-Fi.

For each network, a set of information is returned in the following format: 

```txt
<Identifier> + TAB + <SSID> + TAB + <Security>
```


where: 

- &lt;Identifier&gt;: Network identifier. This identifier can then be passed as a parameter to [WiFiConnect](../WDLang3/1000019352.md) to connect to the network. 

- &lt;SSID&gt;: SSID (Service Set Identifier) of Wi-Fi network.

- &lt;Security&gt;: Security protocol used by the network: 
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *wifiSecurityIEEE8021X* | Security that uses the IEEE 802.1x standard. |
| *wifiSecurityNone* | No security is used. |
| *wifiSecurityWEP* | Security based on a WEP key (Wired Equivalent Privacy). |
| *wifiSecurityWPA2* | Security that uses the WPA2 mechanism (Wi-Fi Protected Access). |
| *wifiSecurityWPA* | Security that uses the WPA mechanism (Wi-Fi Protected Access). |
| *wifiSecurityWPA_EAP* | Security that uses the WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) and EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) mechanisms. |

- To connect the device to one of the networks found in the list, use [WiFiConnect](../WDLang3/1000019352.md) and pass the identifier of the selected network as parameter.

- **WiFiListNetwork** returns the list of Wi-Fi networks configured on the device. To find out the list of access points currently accessible from the device, use [WiFiDetectAccessPoint](../WDLang3/1000019353.md).
