## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000366"></a>
An application written in WINDEV Mobile Android or iOS can receive Push notifications. These Push notifications can be sent from:

- A WINDEV application or a WEBDEV site by [NotifPushSend](../WDLang3/1000020819.md).

- An application or a site written in an external language (Java, PHP, C#, etc.).




When sending a Push notification from an external language, you must identify and respect: 

- [the format expected by the WINDEV Mobile Android application](#NOTE2_1).

- [the format expected by the WINDEV Mobile iOS application](#NOTE3_1).

## Principle for sending a PUSH notification to an Android device from an external language
<a name="principle_for_sending_push_notification_android_device_from_external_language_ELTTEXTE000390"></a>


### Push notification by using the GCM platform
<a name="push_notification_using_the_gcm_platform_ELTPARAGRAPHE000032"></a>

To send a Push notification to an Android device, the server application must perform an HTTP POST request to the following address [https://gcm-http.googleapis.com/gcm/send](https://gcm-http.googleapis.com/gcm/send).

This request must include:

- a header.

- a body describing the notification to send. 




CAUTION: From WINDEV Mobile 22 update 1, sending push notifications for Android is using the Firebase platform (instead of Google Cloud Messaging, GCM). The former projects can still continue to use the GCM solution but the new projects are necessarily using Firebase. WINDEV Mobile supports the push notifications via Firebase from version 22 Update 1.


### Push notification by using the Firebase platform
<a name="push_notification_using_the_firebase_platform_ELTPARAGRAPHE000049"></a>

To send a Push notification to an Android device, the server application must perform an HTTP POST request to the following address [https://fcm.googleapis.com/fcm/send](https://fcm.googleapis.com/fcm/send).

This request must include:

- a header.

- a body describing the notification to send. 




CAUTION: From WINDEV Mobile 22 update 1, the new projects are necessarily using Firebase to send push notifications. 
<a name="NOTE2_3"></a>


### Header description
<a name="header_description_ELTPARAGRAPHE000066"></a>

The header must contain at least the two following elements: 

- Content-Type:application/json

- Authorization:key=&lt;GCM Identifier/Firebase&gt;


&lt;GCM Identifier/Firebase&gt; corresponds to: 

- the identifier of the application on the Google Cloud Messaging service. A specific configuration is required to get this identifier. For more details, see [Configuration required for the Push notifications in Android (GCM)](../WDLang3/1000021022.md).

- the server key found in the parameters of the Firebase application. A specific configuration is required to get this key. For more details, see [Configuration required for the Push notifications in Android (Firebase)](../WDLang3/1000022215.md).



<a name="NOTE2_4"></a>


### Body description
<a name="body_description_ELTPARAGRAPHE000089"></a>

The request body must correspond to a document in JSON format containing: 

- The list of tokens representing the devices onto which the notification will be sent.
	
	```txt
	"registration_ids": [<id device 1>,...<id device N>]
	```


- The version of data exchange format (mandatory).
	
	```txt
	"WX_PUSH_EXT_VERSION":"1.0"
	```


- The notification data as key-value couples for each one of the [Notification](../WDLang3/1000019441.md) properties to assign. There is no need to provide the value of all [Notification](../WDLang3/1000019441.md) properties. The non-assigned properties will take their default value.


Remark: The current version of exchange format is "1.0".

## Principle for sending a PUSH notification to an iOS device from an external language
<a name="principle_for_sending_push_notification_ios_device_from_external_language_ELTTEXTE000450"></a>
**CAUTION : this format may change WITHOUT notice.**

To send a Push notification to an iOS device, you must: 

1. Follow the procedure for payload creation on the Apple site: [https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/BinaryProviderAPI.html](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/BinaryProviderAPI.html)

2. Provide a JSON in the following format.
	
	```txt
	{
	    "aps": { 
	        "alert": {
	            "body": "Bob wants to play poker",
	            "action-loc-key": "PLAY" 
	            "launch-image": "play.png" 
	        },

		"sound": "bingbong.aiff"
	    },
	    "wd": "bar"
	}
	```
