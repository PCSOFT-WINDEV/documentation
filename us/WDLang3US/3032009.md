## Example


```wl
// Send an email via the SMTP protocol
IF EmailStartSession(USER, PASSWORD, "pop3.ifrance.fr", ...
	"smtp.ifrance.fr", 110, 25, True) = True THEN
		UserName = USER
ELSE
	UserName = ""
	Error("Unable to establish the connection")
END

// Initialize the email structure
Email.Recipient = "support@pcsoft.fr"
Email.Sender = "Tartampion@box.net.eu"
Email.Message = "Auto Email Test"
Email.NbRecipient = 1

// Send the email
IF EmailSendMessage(UserName) = False THEN
	Error("EMailSendMessage failed '" + ErrorInfo(errMessage) + "'")
ELSE
	Info("EmailSendMessage was successful")
END
...
// Track the email
SWITCH EmailStatus(Email.MailIdentifier)
	CASE emailSent: Trace("The email was sent")
	CASE emailPending: Trace("The email is currently processed")
	CASE emailError: Trace("Error: " + ErrorInfo(errMessage))
END

## Syntax

`<Result> = EmailStatus(<Email Identifier>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Constant)`**

Outgoing status of the specified email:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *emailError* | An error occurred. The error details are returned by [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md)(*errMessage*). |
| *emailPending* | The email is waiting to be sent. It is in the spooler. |
| *emailSent* | The email was sent. |



**`<Email Identifier>: (Integer)`**

Email identifier (**Email.MailIdentifier** variable or **ID** property of the [Email variable](../WDLang3/1000018713.md) initialized when the email was sent with [EmailSend](../WDLang3/3032003.md) and [EmailSendMessage](../WDLang3/3032005.md)).

## Remarks


### Managing emails in asynchronous mode
<a name="managing_emails_asynchronous_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000065"></a>

The email functions are locking functions by default. Which means that no other code can be run during their execution. The program will resume only when the current Email functions have been run.

**WEBDEV gives you the ability to manage the emails in asynchronous mode.** This mode allows your sites to send emails without locking the execution of other processes.

To use the asynchronous mode, you must:

1. Uncheck "Disable the email spooler" in the WEBDEV administrator ("Advanced" tab).

2. Enable the asynchronous mode when starting the SMTP session (with [EmailStartSMTPSession](../WDLang3/3032025.md) or [EmailStartSession](../WDLang3/3032028.md)).

3. All outgoing emails will be transmitted to a "spooler". Emails are queued up before being sent.




Executing Email functions does no longer block the rest of the program. **EmailStatus** determines the status of an email.

**Remark**: If the WEBDEV administrator is closed, the email spooler is cleared: pending emails are not sent and are removed from the spooler.

If there are pending emails, and the "Disable the email spooler" option is checked, the emails will not be lost: the administrator continues to send them, but the spooler will not accept any new emails.

**Caution**: The asynchronous mode can only be used when starting a session on an SMTP server ([EmailStartSMTPSession](../WDLang3/3032025.md) for sending emails or [EmailStartSession](../WDLang3/3032028.md)). The asynchronous mode is ignored in all other cases.
