```wl
// Retrieve all unread emails from the in-box.
OutlookSession is emailOutlookSession
arrUnreadEmails is array of Emails

// Start the session
OutlookSession.StartSession()

// Retrieve all unread emails
arrUnreadEmails = OutlookSession.GetAll(ertNotRead)

	LOOP_EMAIL.AddLine(MyEmail.Sender, MyEmail.Message, MyEmail.Subject)
END
```

<a name="XSYNTAX"></a>

## Syntax

`<Result> = <Session>.GetAll([<Read options>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Array of Email variables)`**

Emails found in the in-box (the elements effectively retrieved depend on the parameters).

**`<Session>: (emailOutlookSession variable)`**

Name of the [EmailStartOutlookSession](../WDLang3/3032128.md) variable corresponding to the email session to use.

**`<Read options>: (Optional Integer constant)`**

The possible values are:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *ertAsynchronous* | The messages are retrieved in asynchronous mode. The function immediately returns an array of Email variables containing as many elements as necessary. The effective retrieval of data is performed "upon request" when accessing the array elements.<br><br>**Remarks**: <br><br>- In this mode, the progress bars and the callbacks defined by [EmailProgressBar](../WDLang3/3032017.md) are ignored.<br><br>- Older emails are processed first. <br><br><br> |
| *ertFull* | The messages are entirely read from the server (header, message body and attachments). |
| *ertHeader*<br>(default value) | Only the headers are read. The effective retrieval of other data (message body and attachments) is performed "upon request" when accessing the array elements. |
| *ertNotRead* | Only the messages flagged as "not read" on the server are retrieved.<br><br>**Remark**: This value is not available for a POP3. connection. |

## Remarks


### Retrieving messages
<a name="retrieving_messages_ELTPARAGRAPHE000313"></a>

To retrieve all messages as well as their attachments, we recommend that you use the *ertFull* constant to reduce the number of calls to the server.

On the contrary, if only a few emails are to be fully retrieved, it is recommended to use the *ertHeader* constant (default value) and let the message body be automatically retrieved when necessary (i.e. when the **Message** property of the [Email](../WDLang3/1000018713.md) variable is accessed).

**Remarks**: 

- If a property of an email is modified before the message body or the attachments are retrieved, the retrieval of the message body and attachments is canceled.

- **Retrieving Outlook emails**: The **ContentType** property is not available and the **ContentID** property is optional.





### Memory consumption
<a name="memory_consumption_ELTPARAGRAPHE000333"></a>

The retrieval of emails is performed in memory. If the in-box contains several messages or large attachments, the reading can consume a lot of memory.

### Managing the progress bar
<a name="managing_the_progress_bar_ELTPARAGRAPHE000345"></a>

To get the retrieval progress status, implement a progress bar or a procedure with [EmailProgressBar](../WDLang3/3032017.md).

Two procedure syntaxes are supported:

- Procedure receiving two parameters: the total size and the current progress.

- Procedure receiving four parameters: the total size, the current progress, the subscript of the message currently processed and the total number of messages.
