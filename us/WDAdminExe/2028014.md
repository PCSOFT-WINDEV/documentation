- The data displayed comes from the "LOKxxx.tmp" files found in the "\\INSTALL\\LOCK" subdirectory of the setup directory of the application on the server. These files are temporary files (found during the connection only).

- The "Users" tab will be grayed if the management of users is not included in the setup program. To include the management of users in the setup program, see [Managing the users of an application](../Editeurs/2028059.md).
