## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000093"></a>
When a WINDEV application is installed in network, a program used to remotely check the application executables is automatically created: WDADMINEXE.

From the server, WDADMINEXE allows you to:

- [Control the application remotely](../WDAdminExe/2028026.md): 

	- The manager of a network application can stop (automatic or forced shutdown) the application for all the current users.

	- The manager of a network application can configure the frequency of the check for the client applications.




- [Get information about the last available update](../WDAdminExe/2028044.md): The manager of a network application can find tout the number of the current version and the number of the last compatible version. 

- [Find out the characteristics of the application users](../WDAdminExe/2028014.md).

- [Manage the versions installed on the client computers](../WDAdminExe/2028094.md). 

- [Manage the setups in Push mode](../WDAdminExe/2028110.md).

To start WDADMINEXE, double-click the "WDADMINEXE.EXE" file in the "INSTALL" subdirectory of the setup directory of the application on the server.

**Remark**: The remote application control options and the details about the latest update are in an "INI" file. This file is named "WDUPDATE.NET" by default. This file contains the references of the different applications to check and, for each one of them, the characteristics of the check to perform (for more details, see [Structure of control file](../WDLang1/3013005.md)).
