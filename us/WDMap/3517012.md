## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000202"></a>
WDMap is used to view the records **in a data file**. 

This allows you to get an overall view of the different records found in a data file while developing an application.

Remark: WDMap does not allow you to view the result of a query.

## Default display
<a name="default_display_ELTTEXTE000226"></a>
By default, WDMap displays the records found in a data file by using the following rules:

- All the records found in the data file are displayed.

- The records are sorted according to their creation order in the data file.

- All items found in the data file are displayed (except the for "Composite key" items).

- The items are organized in logical order. The logical order corresponds to the display order defined in the data model editor.

- The integrity is supported. 
	**Caution**: If the files linked to the selected file are not automatically found by WDMap, you will only be able to view the records. To add or modify these records, the missing files must be located manually (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=IconeGestionIntegrite.gif)).

- The duplicates are supported.




For more details, see [Special cases](../WDMap/3517005.md).

However, you have the ability to modify:

- The selection of information to display. Indeed, WDMap allows you to select:

	- the records to view,

	- the items to view.




- The display options of viewing table.




For more details, see [Modifying the display mode of records](../WDMap/3517011.md).

## How to?
<a name="how_ELTTEXTE000250"></a>
To view the records found in a data file, the operating mode may change according to the start mode of WDMap:

- Start from the explorer or from the data model editor.

- Start from WINDEV or WEBDEV.

- Start from "WDMAP.EXE" directly.

### WDMap started from the explorer (double click on a data file) or from the data model editor ("Edit the data file with WDMap" in the context menu)
<a name="wdmap_started_from_the_explorer_double_click_data_file_from_the_data_model_editor_edit_the_data_file_with_wdmap_the_context_menu_ELTPARAGRAPHE000067"></a>

To view the records found in the selected data file:

1. Specify if necessary:

	- The password of the selected file (password defined by [HPass](../WDLang4/3044108.md), [HCreation](../WDLang4/3044255.md) or [HCreationIfNotFound](../WDLang4/3044254.md), or during the [automatic data modification](../WDLang4/3044195.md)).

	- The full path of the initial analysis in version 5.5 and its password (if the selected file comes from an analysis in version 5.5).

	- The connection parameters (if the file is handled via an OLE DB provider, an ODBC driver or a native access).




2. The content of data file is displayed in WDMap.

### WDMap started from WINDEV or WEBDEV ("Tools")
<a name="wdmap_started_from_windev_webdev_tools_ELTPARAGRAPHE000093"></a>

To view the records found in a data file:

1. Specify (if necessary) the password of the analysis (runtime password defined in the analysis description).
	Remark: The current application in WINDEV must be associated with an analysis. Otherwise, the operations to perform are the ones described in [WDMAP started by "WDMAP.EXE" directly](#NOTE3_4).

2. Select the logical file to view.

3. Specify if necessary:

	- The password of the selected file (password defined by [HPass](../WDLang4/3044108.md), [HCreation](../WDLang4/3044255.md) or [HCreationIfNotFound](../WDLang4/3044254.md), or during the [automatic data modification](../WDLang4/3044195.md)).

	- The full path of the initial analysis in version 5.5 and its password (if the selected file comes from an analysis in version 5.5).

	- The connection parameters (if the data file is handled via an OLE DB provider, an ODBC driver or a native access).

	- The path of the physical file corresponding to the selected logical file.
			**Remark**: If the current application supports the ".REP" file, you can simplify the selection of the directory of the physical file: click the ".REP file" button and select the ".REP" file of the current application. WDMap will automatically list all the paths of the physical files corresponding to the logical file to view. For more details, see [Managing the ".REP"](../WDLang4/3044186.md).




4. The content of data file is displayed in WDMap.

### WDMAP started by "WDMAP.EXE" directly
<a name="wdmap_started_wdmapexe_directly_ELTPARAGRAPHE000132"></a>

To view the records found in a data file:

1. In the wizard, select "View a file" and go to the next step. A file picker is displayed.

2. Select the physical file to view (use the "Browse" button is necessary).

3. Specify if necessary:

	- The password of the selected file (password defined by [automatic data modification](../WDLang4/3044195.md), [HPass](../WDLang4/3044108.md) or [HCreation](../WDLang4/3044255.md), or during the [HCreationIfNotFound](../WDLang4/3044254.md)).

	- The full path of the initial analysis in version 5.5 and its password (if the selected file comes from an analysis in version 5.5).

	- The connection parameters (if the file is handled via an OLE DB provider, an ODBC driver or a native access).




4. The content of data file is displayed in WDMap.
