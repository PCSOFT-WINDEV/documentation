## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000146"></a>
WDMap allows you to perform simple operations (addition, modification or deletion) on the records found in a data file.

These operations can only be performed while developing the application (WDMap cannot be redistributed).

For example, you can add, modify or delete records before the corresponding windows are created in your application. You can also directly run the test of your processes.

**Caution**: If the operations affect items found in linked files (in the data model editor), we recommend that you enable the management of integrity and duplicates. 
The integrity management and the duplicate management are enabled by default. 
The integrity management is enabled only if the source analysis of file is known: the integrity management is not enabled if the file is directly opened in explorer by WDMap.

**Remarks**:

- To enable the management of integrity, select "Parameters .. Management of integrity". 
	**Caution**: You may sometimes want to manually locate the files linked to the file used. To locate the missing files manually, click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=IconeGestionIntegrite.gif)
 and select the directory of each file taking part in the integrity management for the current file.

- To enable the management of duplicates, select "Parameters .. Management of duplicates".

## Adding a record into a data file
<a name="adding_record_into_data_file_ELTTEXTE000176"></a>
To add a record into a data file:

1. Display the data file into which the record will be added (for more details, see [Viewing the records found in a data file](../WDMap/3517012.md)).

2. Select "Edit .. Add a record" (or click the first empty row of viewing table). A new row is added to the viewing table.

3. In this new row, enter the values corresponding to the new record.
	**Remark**: The arrow keys allow you to move from a column to another one.

4. Click a different row to validate the addition.
	**Remark**: The HFSQL security mechanism will be triggered if a duplicate error occurs while the duplicate management is enabled. Modify the values and validate.




**Remark**: WDMap can also be used to duplicate a record:

1. Select the record to duplicate.

2. Select "Edit .. Duplicate a record" (or press Ctrl + D).

To modify a record in a data file:

1. Display the data file where the record will be modified (for more details, see [Viewing the records found in a data file](../WDMap/3517012.md)).

2. Select the record to modify in the viewing table.

3. Click the column to modify. The input cursor is displayed.

4. Enter the new value.

5. Click another row to validate the modification.
	**Remark**: The HFSQL security mechanism will be triggered if a duplicate error occurs while the duplicate management is enabled. Modify the values and validate.




**Batch processing**: WDMap allows you to modify all the displayed records in a single operation:

1. Select "Edit .. Modify these records".

2. Select "&lt;Initialization&gt;" in the rows corresponding to the items to modify.

3. Enter the new values.

To delete a record from a data file:

1. Display the data file from which the record must be deleted (for more details, see [Viewing the records found in a data file](../WDMap/3517012.md)).

2. Select the record to delete in the viewing table.

3. Select "Edit .. Delete the record" (or press the Del key).

4. Confirm the deletion.
	**Remark**: An error message is displayed if an integrity rule is applied to the deleted record while the integrity management is enabled. The record will not be deleted.




**Tip**: All the displayed records can be deleted in a single operation via "Edit .. Delete all records"
