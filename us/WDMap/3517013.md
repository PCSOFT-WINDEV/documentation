## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000232"></a>
WDMap is used to get various characteristics specific to:

- each file found in a database used by a WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile project, 

- all the files found in a database used by a WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile project.

### WDMap started from the editor
<a name="wdmap_started_from_the_editor_ELTPARAGRAPHE000023"></a>

To get information about the files found in a database:

1. In WDMap, select the WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile analysis (".WDD" file) containing the description of the requested data file (click the "Browse" button if necessary).

2. Specify (if necessary) the password of the analysis (runtime password defined in the analysis description.

3. Select "Display .. General information about the database" (or click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=IconeInfo.gif)). The window containing the database characteristics is displayed.

### WDMAP started by "WDMAP.EXE" directly
<a name="wdmap_started_wdmapexe_directly_ELTPARAGRAPHE000036"></a>

To get information about the files found in a database:

1. In the wizard, select "Select an analysis" and go to the next step.

2. Select the WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile analysis (".WDD" file) containing the description of the requested data file (use the "Browse" button if necessary) and go to the next step. WDMap starts.

3. Specify (if necessary) the password of the analysis (runtime password defined in the analysis description.

4. Select "Display .. General information about the database" (or click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=IconeInfo.gif)). The window containing the database characteristics is displayed.

## What are the displayed characteristics?
<a name="what_are_the_displayed_characteristics_ELTTEXTE000292"></a>
A database used by a WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile project can include files in HFSQL format as well as files in another format.

The window containing the characteristics is divided in half:

- The top section contains the characteristics specific to the HFSQL files.

- The bottom section contains the characteristics specific to the other types of data files (not in HFSQL format) accessed via an OLE DB provider, an ODBC driver or a native access.




**Remark**: If the current database only includes HFSQL files, only the top section will be displayed. If the current database only includes files not in HFSQL format, only the bottom section will be displayed.

### Characteristics specific to HFSQL data files
<a name="characteristics_specific_hfsql_data_files_ELTPARAGRAPHE000066"></a>

The following table presents the characteristics displayed by WDMap. These characteristics are specific to the HFSQL data files found in the database of the WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile project:

| Name | Comment |
| --- | --- |
| Logical name | Name of the file defined in the analysis. |
| Physical name | Name of the physical file associated with the logical file. This name is defined in the analysis. |
| Type | HFSQL Classic or Hyper File 5.5. |
| Total size | Current size (in KB) of the data file, the index file and the memo file corresponding to the logical file. |
| Number of active records | An active record is a record that can be used directly (by [HRead](../WDLang4/3044047.md) for example). |
| Number of crossed records | A crossed record is a record that is logically deleted (by [HCross](../WDLang4/3044121.md)). This record can be retrieved (with <[[3044042\HModify]] or [[3044092\HWrite]]). This record can be physically deleted (by [[3044018\HDelete]]).<br>\-<br>\ <br>Number of deleted records<br>\ <br>A deleted record is a record that is deleted both logically and physically (by [[3044018\HDelete]]).<br>\-<br>\ <br>Total number of records<br>\ <br>Number of active, crossed and deleted records in the file.<br>\-<br>\ <br>Password<br>\ <br>Password of the file defined by [[3044108\HPass]], [[3044255\HCreation]] or [[3044254\HCreationIfNotFound]], or during the [[3044195\automatic data modification]].<br>\-<br>\ <br>Encryption<br>\ <br>Indicates whether the file is encrypted.<br>\-<br>\ <br>Log<br>\ <br>Indicates whether the file is logged.<br>[The log](../WDLang4/3044184.md) is a specific file used to automatically store all the operations performed on one or more data files from a given time. |
| Replication | Specifies whether the file is replicated.<br>[The replication](../WDLang4/3044266.md) is the operation used to maintain remote databases with identical structure, and on which different operations are performed. |
| **Additional information linked to the physical file during a double click on an HFSQL data file** |
| File directory | Directory of physical file. |
| Date of last modification |   |
| Path of analysis in version 5.5 | Only if the selected file comes from an analysis in version 5.5. |
| Directory of the log | Directory of the log file associated with the selected file (if the log file exists). |
| Size of log file | Current size in KB of the log file (if the log file exists). |

For all the HFSQL data files found in the database, the following calculations are automatically performed:

- The total size (in KB) of all the data files.

- The size (in KB) of the log files associated with the data files.

- The number of records found in all the data files.

### Characteristics specific to the other types of files (not in HFSQL format)
<a name="characteristics_specific_the_other_types_files_not_hfsql_format_ELTPARAGRAPHE000146"></a>

The following table presents the characteristics displayed by WDMap. These characteristics are specific to the data files not in HFSQL format found in the database of the WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile project:

| Name | Comment |
| --- | --- |
| File | Logical name of the file. |
| Caption | Name of the connection used to access the different data files found in the current analysis (specified when configuring the connection in the data model editor). |
| Connection via | Access mode to the current database: OLE DB provider, ODBC driver or native access. |
| Data source | Data source of the connection:<br><br>- name and full path of the database, <br><br>- directory of xBase file,<br><br>- name or alias of the server used.<br><br><br> |
| User | User name required to connect to the database. |
| Access | Type of access to the file: read-only or read/write. |
| Number of records | Number of records in the file. |
