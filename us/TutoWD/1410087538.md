## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000427"></a>
The presentation of statistics or summary tables is often required in a management application. This type of presentation can be used to follow:

- the evolution of the orders over time,

- the evolution of turnover, 

- the evolution of stocks,

- ...


Executive managers usually need to know this information. 

WINDEV offers different controls to easily include this information in your applications. Two specific controls will be used in this lesson:

- the Chart control.

- the Pivot Table control.




- Open the project you worked on in the previous lesson. 

	1. Go to the WINDEV home page (Ctrl + &lt;).

	2. On the home page, click "Tutorial", then in "Part 4 - Full application with data", double-click "Full application - Exercise".

	3. A dialogue box prompts you to open the project you worked on in the previous lesson. You can open the local copy or the original project. Select "Open the local copy".

## Displaying data in a Chart control
<a name="displaying_data_chart_control_ELTTEXTE000469"></a>
To handle the Chart control in real conditions, we will create a Chart control to display the sales status in the "WD Full Application" application.

First, we will create a query to select the data that will be displayed in the Chart control.
<a name="NOTE3_2"></a>


### Selecting the data that will be displayed in the Chart control
<a name="selecting_the_data_that_will_displayed_the_chart_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000058"></a>

In the chart, we will get the sum of orders by date.

We will create a query to perform a sum. We will calculate the total amount of orders (TotalIOT item in the Order data file).

We will calculate the total amount of all the orders per date (i.e., the Turnover per date).



- Create a new query:

	1. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_Cr%E9er1_GAF.jpg) in the quick access buttons.

	2. The new element window appears: click "Query".

	3. We are going to create a select query. Select the "Select" option. Go to the next step.

	4. The query description window appears.

	5. Add the Order.Date and Order.TotalIOT items to the query:

		- On the left, expand the "Order" data file.

		- Double-click the Date item then the TotalIOT item.

		- The two items appear in the middle of the screen (in the "List of elements in your query" area).







- To calculate the sum of values of "Order.TotalIOT":

	1. Select the "Order.TotalIOT" item in the middle of the screen.

	2. In the "Actions", on the right, select "Sum". The sum description window appears.  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Application%20compl%E8te%20-%20Graphe%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.jpg&type=thumb)


	3. Validate the sum description. The sum of "TotalIOT" was added to the list of the query result.

| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png) | Note | You will notice that the WINDEV query editor creates the queries in common language (and also in SQL). <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Application%20compl%E8te%20-%20Graphe%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.jpg)<br>This allows you to check the purpose of your query. |







- We are now going to group the data by year and to sort it:

	1. Select the "Order.Date" item in the middle of the screen.

	2. In the "Actions", on the right, click "Year, month" and select "Year". A window appears allowing you to create the Year item:  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Application%20compl%E8te%20-%20Graphe%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.jpg)


	3. Validate this window ("OK").

4. The "Year" item is displayed in the middle of the query description.

5. Select the "Year" item and define the sort:

	- Open the context menu of the "Year" item.

	- Select "Sort item .. Sort in ascending order".

	- An arrow appears in the query description, indicating the sort type.




- The query is created. We are going to give it a name and save it.

	1. At the top of the query description window, enter: 

		- the name "QRY_SalesEvolutions".

		- the caption "Sum of orders by date". 




2. Validate the query description window. 

3. The save window is displayed. Validate the default information. 

4. The graphic query representation is as follows:  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Application%20compl%E8te%20-%20Graphe%20-%20HC%20N%B0004.jpg)

7. Validate the Tab control description window.

8. The new tab pane appears in the window.



<a name="NOTE4_2"></a>


### Creating the Pivot Table control
<a name="creating_the_pivot_table_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000265"></a>

- To create a Pivot table control:

	1. In "WIN_Menu", select the "Pivot Table" tab if necessary.

	2. On the "Creation" tab, in the "Data" group, expand "Table and List Box" and select "Pivot Table (PVT)". The control appears under the mouse cursor.

	3. Click the "Pivot Table" tab pane. The Pivot Table control creation wizard starts.

	4. Go to the next step.

	5. Various information must be displayed **in the cells**:

		- the total sales amount.

		- the quantity sold.


 We are going to select the source data file in the wizard: OrderLine.
			For the first value select:

- Display: "The sum of".

- Source: "TotalIOT".

6. The years will be displayed **in the column headings**. On the left, expand the Order data file and double-click the Date item. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Application%20compl%E8te%20-%20TCD%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.jpg&type=thumb)
Go to the next step.

7. The wizard proposes to establish a link to the Order data file and to display three levels of data in the headings: years, quarters and months.  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Application%20compl%E8te%20-%20TCD%20-%20HC%20N%B0004.jpg)

### Testing the Pivot Table control
<a name="testing_the_pivot_table_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000326"></a>

- Test the window (click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_GO_Fenetre_WD_GAF.jpg) in the quick access buttons). 

	1. Click the "Pivot Table" tab pane, then the "Calculate" control.
			|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png) | Note | CAUTION: The calculation time depends on the size of the database and the number of row and column headings. The result of the pivot table can be saved to avoid recalculating values. |





	2. Click "&gt;" to expand the different columns and rows.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Application%20compl%E8te%20-%20TCD%20-%20HC%20N%B0006.jpg&type=thumb)








- Stop the test. We will make some changes to improve the Pivot Table control. So far, nothing indicates that one of the numbers in the cells corresponds to a quantity. We are going to use a specific display mask for this value.




- To set a display mask in a cell:

	1. Open the description of the Pivot Table control (double-click the control).

	2. In the "Content" tab, click "VAL_NoName2". The description of the values displayed in the cells appears.

	3. In the "Mask" area, add the prefix "Qt: ".  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Application%20compl%E8te%20-%20TCD%20-%20HC%20N%B0007.jpg&type=thumb)


	4. Validate the description window.

5. Test the window again.
