## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000639"></a>
In previous lessons, we covered how to add and modify records. We will now complete our application by adding a search functionality (to modify a record, for example). 

We will modify the main window of the "WD Full Application" application to add some tab panes.

- The first tab pane will display the list of products and will allow you to add and modify them (we have seen these operations in previous lessons).

- In the second tab pane you will be able to find a customer by name. The customer form will be displayed in the same tab pane.




Two search modes will be implemented:

- an exact-match search,

- a generic search.

<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Application%20compl%E8te%20-%204%20-%20Aper%E7u%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.jpg&type=thumb)
Then, we will be able to loop through the records in the data file depending on the displayed customer. 



- Open the project you worked on in the previous lesson. 

	1. Go to the WINDEV home page (Ctrl + &lt;).

	2. On the home page, click "Tutorial", then in "Part 4 - Full application with data", double-click "Full application - Exercise".

	3. A dialogue box prompts you to open the project you worked on in the previous lesson. You can open the local copy or the original project. Select "Open the local copy".

## Modifying the window: using a Tab control
<a name="modifying_the_window_using_tab_control_ELTTEXTE000681"></a>
In this example, the search will not be performed in a new window: we will use the WIN_Menu window. So far, this window displays the list of products.

We will use a Tab control to display different data in the same window. Tab controls are used to group information by theme. The user can directly access a theme by clicking the desired tab.

This system is used in all WINDEV description windows.
<a name="NOTE3_2"></a>


### Creating the Tab control
<a name="creating_the_tab_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000063"></a>

- To display the data of the "WIN_Menu" window in a Tab control:

	1. Open the "WIN_Menu" window if necessary:

		- from the open document tabs.

		- by double-clicking its name in the "Project explorer" pane.




2. Select the controls and move them outside the window. This may seem "strange", but it will make it easier to work on the Tab control and then associate the controls with the desired tab pane.  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Application%20compl%E8te%20-%20Rech%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.jpg&type=thumb)

| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png) | Note | **Handling controls in a Tab control**<br><br>- To check whether all the controls are associated with the current tab, click another tab: all controls associated with the tab disappear. <br><br>- To resize the Tab control without taking into account the anchors defined on the controls of the tab pane, hold down the Shift key while you resize the control.<br><br><br> |


<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Application%20compl%E8te%20-%20Rech%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.jpg&type=thumb)

<a name="NOTE3_3"></a>


### Modifying the Tab control
<a name="modifying_the_tab_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000106"></a>



- Change the name of the Tab control:

	1. Double-click the Tab control that was just created: the control description window appears.

	2. Change the control name. Name the control "TAB_View".

	3. Validate the control description window.







- Two tabs are created by default. We will change their text directly:

	1. Select the Tab control.

	2. Click "Tab 1". The tab switches to edit mode: type "List of products". Press Enter to validate.  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Application%20compl%E8te%20-%20Rech%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.jpg)


	3. Click "Tab 2". The tab pane is displayed. Click "Tab 2" again. Type "Find customers". Press Enter to validate.




- We will associate an image with each tab in the Tab control. To do so:

	1. Open the Tab control description window (double-click the control, for example). The "General" tab of the description window allows you to configure the characteristics of each tab in the Tab control. The list of tabs is displayed on the left. You can change the characteristics of each selected tab on the right of the screen.

	2. In the description window, select "List of products".  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Application%20compl%E8te%20-%20Rech%20-%20HC%20N%B0004.jpg&type=thumb)


	3. The tab characteristics are displayed.  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Application%20compl%E8te%20-%20Rech%20-%20HC%20N%B0004%201.jpg&type=thumb)




- We have just created a new control: we must define its anchors in the window. When the window is enlarged, the Tab control must also be enlarged in order to occupy the entire available space. Therefore, the control must stretch to the right and to the bottom.

	1. Select the Tab control.

	2. Right-click to open the context menu and select "Anchor".

	3. In the window for defining the anchor, select ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_MP%20-%20Ancrage%20fiche%20-%20HC%20N%B0002%202.jpg) and validate.

	4. Save the window by clicking ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_Enregistrer_GAF.jpg) in the quick access buttons.

<a name="NOTE4_1"></a>


## Implementing the search
<a name="implementing_the_search_ELTTEXTE000753"></a>
The "WIN_Menu" window was entirely created. We can now focus on the content of the Tab control pane for finding customers.

This Tab control pane will be divided into several areas:

- An area for entering the search elements.

- An area for displaying the data found.

- An area containing the navigation buttons.



<a name="NOTE4_2"></a>


### Area for displaying the data found
<a name="area_for_displaying_the_data_found_ELTPARAGRAPHE000184"></a>

First, we will create different controls to display the customer data.

We will create the Edit controls in the same way we created the controls in the product form window: a simple Drag and Drop from the "Analysis" pane.



- To create the controls that will display the customer data:

	1. Open the WIN_Menu window in the editor and click the "Find customers" tab. The empty tab pane appears.

	2. Display the "Analysis" pane in the editor if necessary: on the "Home" tab, in the "Environment" group, expand "Panes", select "Panes", and then select "Analysis". The different data files described in the "WD Full Application" analysis appear in the pane.

	3. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Application%20compl%E8te%20-%202%20-%20Fiche%20produit%20-%20HC%20N%B0001%201.jpg) to the left of the "Customer" data file: the items in the data file appear.

	4. Select the items of the Customer data file displayed in the "Analysis" pane. You can select multiple elements by holding the Ctrl key down.

	5. Drag and drop these items onto the "Find customers" tab pane.  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Application%20compl%E8te%20-%20Rech%20-%20HC%20N%B0006.jpg&type=thumb)


	6. The controls are automatically created in the Tab control pane. These controls are bound to the corresponding item in the data file. 

7. Save the window (Ctrl + S).




- We will align the controls and make them the same size:

	1. Select the "City" control and then the other Edit controls in the window (hold the Ctrl key down while clicking the different controls). The first selected control will be used as reference to set the size of the other controls.

	2. On the "Alignment" tab, in the "Inside and outside" group, click "Justify (Ins. and Out.)".  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Application%20compl%E8te%20-%20Rech%20-%20HC%20N%B0007.jpg&type=thumb)








- Test the window (click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_GO_Fenetre_WD_GAF.Jpg) in the quick access buttons). Click the "Find customers" tab. The window is displayed with empty controls.

- Close the test window to go back to the editor.



<a name="NOTE4_3"></a>


### Exact-match search
<a name="exactmatch_search_ELTPARAGRAPHE000242"></a>

To perform an exact-match search, we are going to select the customer name in a Combo Box control. The "Generic search" Button control will be used to display the form of the corresponding person. A single person corresponds to the selected name.



- The Combo Box control will be located above the created controls. If the controls are too close to the top of the Tab control pane, you will need to move them down. To do so:

	1. Select all the controls in the Tab control pane:

		- Press Ctrl + A: all the controls in the window and in the current tab pane are selected.

		- Hold the Ctrl key down and click the Tab control: only the controls in the Tab control pane are selected.

		- Release the Ctrl key.




2. Move one of the selected controls down.  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Application%20compl%E8te%20-%20Rech%20-%20HC%20N%B0008.jpg&type=thumb)




- To create the search control:

	1. Create a Combo Box control: on the "Creation" tab, in the "Usual controls" group, click "Combo Box".

	2. Click "Find customers", and position the control between the tab and the "Customer ID" control.

	3. The Combo Box control creation wizard appears. We will create a Combo Box control based on the "Customer" data file. 

	4. Select "Display data from a file or existing query". <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Application%20compl%E8te%20-%20Rech%20-%20HC%20N%B0009.jpg&type=thumb)
Go to the next step of the wizard.

	5. Select the "Customer" data file. Go to the next step.

	6. We will display the customer's first and last name. 

		- Deselect the "CustomerID" item.

		- Select the "FullName" item.  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Application%20compl%E8te%20-%20Rech%20-%20HC%20N%B0010.jpg&type=thumb)







- To create the Button control to find customers: 

	1. Create a Button control: on the "Creation" tab, in the "Usual controls" group, click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_Bouton_GAF.jpg).

	2. Position the Button control next to the Combo Box that was just created.

	3. Name the control "BTN_ExactMatchSearch" and define "Exact-match search" as caption.

	4. If necessary, adjust the size of the control so that the caption is displayed properly in the control.

	5. Write the following WLanguage code in the "Click" event of the control:
			
		```wl
		// Finds the customer by identifier 
		Customer.ReadSeekFirst(CustomerID, COMBO_Customer) 
		IF Customer.Found() THEN
			// Displays the customer data
			Customer.ToWindow()
		END
		```


	6. Let's take a look at this WLanguage code:

		- [&lt;Data file&gt;.ReadSeekFirst](../WDLang4/1000025034.md) is used to perform an exact-match search. In this example, the search is performed on the Customer data file and on the CustomerID item. The search value is the last parameter of the function. Here, the search value corresponds to the value selected in the Combo Box. This value is obtained by using the name of the Combo Box control (COMBO_Customer).

		- [&lt;Data file&gt;.Found](../WDLang4/1000025076.md) is used to check the search result. If [&lt;Data file&gt;.Found](../WDLang4/1000025076.md) returns <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>, a value was found; if [&lt;Data file&gt;.Found](../WDLang4/1000025076.md) returns <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>, no value was found. Any record found is read and it becomes the current record in the data file.

		- In this code, if the record was found, it is displayed by [&lt;Data file&gt;.ToWindow](../WDLang4/1000021397.md).
						|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png) | Note | [&lt;Data file&gt;.ToWindow](../WDLang4/1000021397.md) and [ScreenToFile](../WDLang4/3044146.md) perform the reverse operation: the data in the items of the data file is displayed in the corresponding controls. |








7. Close the code editor.

8. Save the window (Ctrl + S).




- Let's run a window test:

	1. Test the window (click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_GO_Fenetre_WD_GAF.jpg) in the quick access buttons).

	2. Click the "Find customers" tab if necessary.

	3. Select a value in the Combo Box control and click "Exact-match search".  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Application%20compl%E8te%20-%20Rech%20-%20HC%20N%B0014.jpg&type=thumb)


	4. The result appears immediately.

5. Close the test window to go back to the editor.



<a name="NOTE4_4"></a>


### Generic search
<a name="generic_search_ELTPARAGRAPHE000369"></a>

We are now going to perform a generic search. Instead of searching for an exact value, we will search for all the elements that start with the value entered.

To perform this search, we will create an Edit control to enter the name you are looking for, and a Button control to launch the search.

- To create the search control:

	1. If necessary, select the "Find customers" tab of "WIN_Menu" in the editor.

	2. Create an Edit control: on the "Creation" tab, in the "Usual controls" group, click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_Saisie_GAF.jpg).

	3. In the window, click below the Combo Box control ("Sought customer"). The edit control is created.

	4. Name the control "EDT_Sought_Name" and define "Sought name" as caption.







- To create the Button control to launch the generic search:

	1. Create a Button control: on the "Creation" tab, in the "Usual controls" group, click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_Bouton_GAF.jpg).

	2. Position the control next to the Edit control that was just created.  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Application%20compl%E8te%20-%20Rech%20-%20HC%20N%B0017.jpg&type=thumb)


	3. Name this control "BTN_GenericSearch" and define "Generic search" as caption.

4. If necessary, adjust the size of the control so that the caption is displayed properly in the control.

5. Write the following WLanguage code in the "Click" event of the button:
			
		```wl
		// Finds a customer by name
		Customer.ReadSeek(FullName, EDT_Sought_Name)
		IF Customer.Found() THEN
			// Displays the customer data
			Customer.ToWindow()
		ELSE
			Error("No customer matches")
		END
		```

			[&lt;Data file&gt;.ReadSeek](../WDLang4/1000025023.md) is used to perform a generic search. In this example, the search is performed on the "Customer" data file and on the "FullName" item. The search value corresponds to the value typed in the "EDT_Sought_Name" control. This value is obtained by using the control name.
			|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png) | Note | To perform an exact-match search, call [&lt;Data file&gt;.ReadSeek](../WDLang4/1000025023.md): to do so, the **hIdentical** constant must be used. |





6. Close the code window.

7. Save the window (Ctrl + S).




- Let's run a window test:

	1. Test the window (click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_GO_Fenetre_WD_GAF.jpg) in the quick access buttons).

	2. Click the "Find customers" tab if necessary.

	3. Enter a value in the edit control (for example "BEEF") and click "Generic search".  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Application%20compl%E8te%20-%20Rech%20-%20HC%20N%B0015.jpg&type=thumb)


	4. The result appears immediately. However, if several records correspond to the search, only the first one is displayed.

5. Stop the test and go back to the editor.



<a name="NOTE4_5"></a>


### Browsing forms
<a name="browsing_forms_ELTPARAGRAPHE000440"></a>

We will add four Button controls to browse through the different records of the "Customer" data file. These controls are in a "Navigation" layout. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Application%20compl%E8te%20-%20Rech%20-%20HC%20N%B0017%201.jpg)
These controls will allow you to: 

- browse through the different records in the data file,

- browse through all the records corresponding to a generic search. 


Each button has an icon that displays:

- the first record,

- the previous record,

- the next record,

- the last record.




- To create the Button control used to display the first file record:

	1. Go to the "Find customers" tab in the editor.

	2. On the "Creation" tab, in the "Usual controls" group, click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_Bouton_GAF.jpg).

	3. The shape of the control appears under the mouse pointer. Then click the Tab control pane, below "Generic search". The Button control is automatically created.







- Skin templates are used to standardize the windows in a project. They define the style of all controls in the windows. A specific style is defined for each navigation button. To apply this style:

	1. Select the Button control if necessary.

	2. Right-click to open the context menu and select "Choose a style". 

	3. All the button styles are displayed in the window that appears. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Application%20compl%E8te%20-%20Rech%20-%20HC%20N%B0016.jpg&type=thumb)
Select "BTN_First".

	4. Validate.







- Change the name of the Button control: 

	1. Open the control description window:

		- Select the Button control.

		- Right-click to open the context menu and select "Description".




2. Name this control "BTN_First".

3. Validate the description window.




- We are now going to type the WLanguage code associated with this control:

	1. Right-click the control. Select "Code" in the menu that appears.

	2. In the code window that appears, write the following WLanguage code in the "Click" event:
			
		```wl
		// Reads the first customer
		Customer.ReadFirst()
		IF Customer.Out() THEN
			// No customer
			Info("No form to view.")
		ELSE
			// Displays the customer data
			Customer.ToWindow()
		END
		```
[&lt;Data file&gt;.ReadFirst](../WDLang4/1000025022.md) is used to read the first file record according to the key used for the last search (FullName in our case).







- Likewise, create 3 Button controls.

	- Name these controls as follows: "BTN_Previous", "BTN_Next" and "BTN_Last".

	- Associate these controls with the following styles: "BTN_Previous", "BTN_Next" and "BTN_Last".

	- The WLanguage code corresponding to the "Click" event of "BTN_Previous" is:
			
		```wl
		// If no search is in progress
		IF Customer.Out() THEN
			// Reads the last customer
			Customer.ReadLast()
		END
		
		// Reads the previous customer
		Customer.ReadPrevious()
		// If the start of the data file is reached
		IF Customer.Out() THEN
			Info ("Start of data file reached.")
		ELSE
			// Displays the customer data
			Customer.ToWindow()
		END
		```


	- The WLanguage code corresponding to the "Click" event of "BTN_Next" is:
			
		```wl
		// If no search is in progress
		IF Customer.Out() THEN
			// Reads the first customer
			Customer.ReadFirst()
		END
		
		// Reads the next customer
		Customer.ReadNext()
		// If the end of the data file is reached
		IF Customer.Out() THEN
			Info("End of data file reached.")
		ELSE
			// Displays the customer data
			Customer.ToWindow()
		END
		```


	- The WLanguage code corresponding to the "Click" event of "BTN_Last" is:
			
		```wl
		// Reads the last customer
		Customer.ReadLast()
		IF Customer.Out() THEN
			// No customer
			Info("No form to view.")
		ELSE
			// Displays the customer data
			Customer.ToWindow()
		END
		```



 In these different codes:

- [&lt;Data file&gt;.ReadLast](../WDLang4/1000025020.md) reads the last record in the data file based on the key used for the last search.

- [&lt;Data file&gt;.ReadNext](../WDLang4/1000025035.md) reads the record whose key value is immediately greater than the one of the current record.

- [&lt;Data file&gt;.ReadPrevious](../WDLang4/1000025021.md) reads the record whose key value is immediately less than the one of the current record.


|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png) | Note | The code in the "Next" and "Previous" Button controls contains additional lines of code to: <br><br>- Check whether a search has already been started in the Customer data file (check the result of [&lt;Data file&gt;.Out](../WDLang4/1000024605.md) to find out if a read operation has already been started).<br><br>- Read the first or last record if necessary. The next or previous record cannot be read if no reading has been started in the data file.  <br><br><br> |







- Save the window by clicking ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_Enregistrer_GAF.jpg) in the quick access buttons.

	2. Click the "Find customers" tab if necessary.

	3. Find a customer (enter "BEEF" and start a generic search, for example).

	4. Browse the data file by clicking each of the navigation buttons.
