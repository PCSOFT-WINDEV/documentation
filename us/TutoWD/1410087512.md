## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000292"></a>
WINDEV is a complete DevOps Integrated Development Environment aimed at developing Windows (and Linux) applications in diverse fields: business, industrial, medical, ... The applications can access information stored in databases.

Throughout this tutorial, you will learn how to create your applications (with or without a database) and how to enrich them using the many features offered by WINDEV.

## Starting WINDEV
<a name="starting_windev_ELTTEXTE000316"></a>


- Start WINDEV 28.

	- **If you haven't started WINDEV 28 before**, a welcome wizard will appear:

		- If you worked with an earlier WINDEV version, this wizard allows you to retrieve the existing configurations.

		- If you are a new user, this wizard allows you to configure your environment. You will be able to choose the screen configuration and set up the Control Centers. 




- **If you have already started WINDEV 28**, log in if necessary. The development environment opens up. The home page appears. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Bienvenue_WD_defaut.jpg&type=thumb)
This home page allows you to: 

	- view news about PC SOFT products,

	- create a project, 

	- open an existing project, 

	- open an example, 

	- open one of the projects from the tutorial. 




- Let's take a closer look at the WINDEV development environment: 

	- In the home page, click "Tutorial".

	- In "Part 1 - Lesson 1.1. Discover WINDEV", double click "Full application - Answers".  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Bienvenue%202%20WD%20-%20HC%20N%B0005.jpg&type=thumb)

			The corresponding project opens in the editor. The project dashboard is displayed. The project dashboard allows you to monitor the progress of a project via several widgets. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P1_Environnement%20WD%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.jpg&type=thumb)
Remark: the project dashboard is presented in [Lesson 4.12. Monitor changes in your applications](../TutoWD/1410087527.md).

## Development environment

### The editor
<a name="the_editor_ELTPARAGRAPHE000072"></a>

The WINDEV development environment includes a specific UI and multiple editors that allow you to create the different elements of your applications.

The window editor allows you to create windows, the report editor allows you to create reports, etc.

- To discover WINDEV, open the "Product form" window: 

	1. Press Ctrl + E. 

	2. In the window that appears, enter the name of the window to be opened: WIN_Product_form. 

	3. Validate. The window appears in the editor. 







All editors use the same environment: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P1_Environnement%20WD%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.jpg&type=thumb)


1. **Menu of editors**, displayed as a ribbon (we'll see how to use it in the next paragraph).

2. **Current editor** (window editor in this case). The editor shows the element being created or modified in WYSIWYG mode (What You See Is What You Get).

3. **Panes**. The WINDEV UI includes multiple horizontal and vertical panes that allow you to quickly access different types of information. For example: 

	- the "Project explorer" pane (left) lists all project elements by category.

	- the search pane (bottom) allows you to perform searches in the entire project and its elements.


 These panes can be hidden by pressing Ctrl + W if necessary.

4. **Open document tabs**. These tabs allow you to quickly see all open elements. Simply click a tab to open an element in its corresponding editor.

### The ribbon in detail
<a name="the_ribbon_detail_ELTPARAGRAPHE000100"></a>

The options in WINDEV are accessible via a ribbon. This ribbon contains tabs in which the different options of the editors are grouped.

**Ribbon elements**
The ribbon includes three areas:  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P1_Environnement%20WD%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.jpg&type=thumb)


- the Buttons area, on the left (1).

- the Tabs area, at the top (2).

- the Options area (3).


Let's take a closer look at these areas. 

**The Buttons area (1)**


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P1_Environnement%20WD%20-%20HC%20N%B0003%201.jpg)<br> | The Buttons area groups the **quick access buttons**. These buttons are used to perform the most usual operations, common to all editors: save, open, create, etc.<br><br>You can open the "About" window from the logo of the IDE.  |

**The Tabs area (2)**<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P1_Environnement%20WD%20-%20HC%20N%B0003%202.jpg)
The different ribbon tabs allow you to access the options of the editors for the current project. Multiple types of tabs are available:

- the current tab: The tab name appears in bold and a yellow line is displayed below the tab name.

- the context tabs, specific to the current element: The tab name appears in yellow (or blue in the light theme).

- the available tabs: The tab name appears in white (or in black in the light theme).




**The Options area (3)**<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P1_Environnement%20WD%20-%20HC%20N%B0003%203.jpg&type=thumb)
The options in the ribbon change depending on the selected tab. Multiple types of options are available:

- Options to check.

- Buttons to click.

- Drop-down buttons used to expand options. Two types of drop-down buttons are available:

	- drop-down buttons used to expand a menu

	- split buttons used to expand a menu (click on the arrow), or to perform a default action (click on the button icon).





The options are organized by groups. Each group of options has a name and can have a dialog box launcher ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_Regroupement_GAF.jpg). This button is used to perform a specific action according to the current group: open the description of the current element, open the help, etc, ... 

In this tutorial, to identify a menu option, we will use the terms "tabs" and "groups". For example:

To open the help, go to the "Home" tab, "Online help" group and click "Help".
<a name="NOTE4_3"></a>


### Options of the environment
<a name="options_the_environment_ELTPARAGRAPHE000166"></a>

You can change many options of the environment: 

- Theme: By default, the environment uses a dark theme. However, several themes are available: 

	- Light theme, grey ribbon. In this mode, the menu bar has no colors: it is grayed out. 

	- Gray theme. In this mode, the environment and windows of the interface are displayed on a light gray background. 

	- Dark theme. In this mode, the environment and windows of the interface are displayed on a black or dark gray background. 




- Language: By default, the environment is displayed in the language chosen during setup. The environment can be displayed in English, French or Spanish.

- Pane: Some panes are displayed by default in the environment ("Project explorer", etc.). You can choose which panes are displayed and set their position.  




All these options can be found in the options of the environment. To change these options, go to the "Home" tab, "Environment" group, expand "Options" and select "General options of WINDEV". You can change many options of the environment in the different tabs of the window that appears. 
Bear in mind that changing certain options may require restarting WINDEV.

## Conclusion
<a name="conclusion_ELTTEXTE000376"></a>
We have covered the essentials of the WINDEV environment. In the next lesson, you will be able to create your first WINDEV application. 



- To continue this tutorial, close the current project: 

	1. On the "Home" tab, in the "General" group, expand "Close" and select "Close project". 

	2. Save the changes if necessary. 

	3. The WINDEV home page appears.
