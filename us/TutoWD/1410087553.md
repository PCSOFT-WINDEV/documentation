## Definition
<a name="definition_ELTTEXTE000132"></a>
Threads allow running code (or processes) in parallel with the main application. Therefore, several long processes can be run in the background without locking the main application (also called "Main thread").

Threads replace some types of timers.

In most cases, a secondary thread is used to detect an event such as a user action, an incoming email, a phone call, etc.

Examples of the use of threads:

- Retrieving emails in the background, while writing a new email.

- Communication application: managing phone calls, communication via sockets, etc.




WINDEV allows you to:

- manage threads (***Thread***\* functions).

- use "signals" in order to synchronize several threads (***Signal***\* functions).

- use threads with "semaphores" to control access to the resources shared by different threads (***Semaphore***\* functions).
