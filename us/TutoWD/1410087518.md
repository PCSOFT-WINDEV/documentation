The code editor allows you to expand or collapse the WLanguage code. This feature is very useful if your processes use a lot of structured statements (loops, conditions, browses, etc.).

Only the comments remain visible. Hovering over each comment allows you to view the associated WLanguage code in a tooltip: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P1_QR%20-%20Code%20r%E9pli%E9%20-%20HC%20N%B01.jpg)

<a name="there_way_easily_get_the_syntax_help_wlanguage_function_ELTPARAGRAPHE000142"></a>

When entering a WLanguage function in the code editor:

- the name of each parameter is displayed in a tooltip in the line of code being entered. Hover over the name of the current parameter to see its details.
	If several syntaxes are available, it is possible to switch from one syntax to another using Ctrl + up arrow or down arrow.

- the syntax of the WLanguage function is displayed in the status bar of the editor.




In the help displayed, the parameters between [ and ] are optional.

For WLanguage functions that use names of data files, controls, windows or reports, the assisted input also displays the list of project elements that correspond to the parameter of the function being typed.

A help page is associated with each WLanguage function and property. This help page can be directly accessed from the editor by pressing F1 on the name of the desired function or property.

- Ctrl + F2 is used to go back to the initial process or event. 
	To move from one process/event to another, press F2 repeatedly. To go back to the initial process or event, press Ctrl + F2 the same number of times. 

- Ctrl + L deletes the current line.

- Ctrl + D duplicates the current line (or the selected lines) on the line below.

- Tab and Shift + Tab are used to increase and decrease the indent of the selected lines.
