## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000245"></a>
You may have to handle data when creating an application. To store the data, you must create a "database".

The first thing you should do in a WINDEV project that handles data is create an "analysis".

An analysis contains the description of the data files (or tables) containing the application data.

When running the application, these descriptions will be used to create the database and/or the data files. Data will be stored in this database or these data files.|   |   |   |

| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png) | Note | Several HFSQL database maintenance tools are provided with WINDEV. They can be accessed from the HFSQL Control Center. |



WINDEV can handle most of the database formats (nearly all of them). The most common formats are:

- HFSQL, a database system provided with WINDEV. The HFSQL database is available in Classic or Client/Server mode.

- Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, SQL Azure, etc.

- AS/400, Access, Sybase, Informix, etc.

- Any database accessible in SQL language in Windows.

- Text (ASCII files).




Several methods can be used to access data:

- Native Connector (also called Native Access), 

- OLE DB access,

- Direct ODBC access,

- ODBC access via OLE DB.

## HFSQL
<a name="hfsql_ELTTEXTE000287"></a>
HFSQL is a powerful, fast and reliable database.

HFSQL runs on Windows and Linux, on mobile devices (iOS, Android), networks of any size and type, and automatically manages hundreds of concurrent accesses.

HFSQL is available in Classic and Client/Server mode.

HFSQL can be freely distributed with your WINDEV applications.

HFSQL includes all the features of a database, especially:

- [logging](../WDLang4/3044184.md),

- [transactions](../WDLang4/3044335.md),

- [replication](../WDLang4/3044266.md),

- [triggers](../WDLang4/3044272.md).




In the different parts of this tutorial, we will use an HFSQL Classic database and then, an HFSQL Client/Server database.

## Different modes for accessing databases
<a name="different_modes_for_accessing_databases_ELTTEXTE000311"></a>


### Native Connector (Native Access)
<a name="native_connector_native_access_ELTPARAGRAPHE000085"></a>

A Native Connector uses a database format directly and exclusively. This optimized type of access is developed specifically for each database format.

In WINDEV, a Native Connector is available for the following databases:

- HFSQL Classic or Client/Server (standard)

- Access (standard)

- SQLite (standard)

- Oracle (optional)

- AS/400 (optional)

- SQL Server (optional)

- Sybase (optional)

- Informix (optional)

- DB2 (optional)

- Progress (optional)

- MySQL (optional and free)

- PostgreSQL (optional and free)

- MariaDB (optional and free)

- SQL Azure (optional and free)


Other Native Connectors will be available soon, contact our sales department for more details!

The **SQL\*** and **HRead\*** functions in WLanguage can be used with this type of access. The code is portable and independent of the database.
<a name="NOTE4_2"></a>


### Direct ODBC access
<a name="direct_odbc_access_ELTPARAGRAPHE000113"></a>

An access via ODBC uses a multi-database access standard. The ODBC layer must be installed on your computer. In most cases, this layer is already installed in the recent Windows versions. 

This can be verified following these steps: 

- For Windows 32-bit systems: from the Windows Start menu, select "Settings .. Control Panel .. Administrative Tools .. Data Sources".

- For Windows 64-bit systems: double-click the following file: C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\odcbad32.exe. This opens a "Data Source Administrator" dialog box that allows you to create the required 32-bit ODBC data source on the 64-bit system.




Caution: some databases may not be accessible via this method. If you want to use this type of access, check whether an ODBC driver exists and install this driver if necessary.

Only the **SQL\*** WLanguage functions can be used with this type of access.
<a name="NOTE4_3"></a>


### OLE DB access
<a name="ole_access_ELTPARAGRAPHE000129"></a>

An access via OLE DB uses a multi-database access standard. This type of access is based on MDAC (Microsoft Data Access Component).|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=avertissement.png) | Important | If you are using an OLE DB access, MDAC must necessarily be installed on the user computers (version 2.6 or later). |



Some databases may not be accessible via this method. If you want to use this type of access, check whether an OLE DB driver exists.

The **SQL\*** and **HRead\*** functions in WLanguage can be used with this type of access.
<a name="NOTE4_4"></a>


### ODBC access via OLE DB
<a name="odbc_access_via_ole_ELTPARAGRAPHE000143"></a>

In summary, it is a "mix" of OLE DB and ODBC. This is the "heaviest" and least efficient method in terms of performance. It should not be used on small databases.

The **SQL\*** and **HRead\*** functions in WLanguage can be used with this type of access.

## Project with analysis
<a name="project_with_analysis_ELTTEXTE000371"></a>
In this part of the tutorial, we will create and associate a project with an HFSQL database.

This will allow you to discover the main elements for creating an application: 

- Creating a WINDEV project.

- Describing the data files used by the application.




In a following part, we will focus on the development of the elements of an application with data (windows, reports, etc.). This application will be developed from scratch, from the interface to the final distribution. You will see the main points for developing an application.

In this part, we will also create a database to manage orders.

The same type of database will be used in part 4 of this tutorial to develop a full application. We will use HFSQL Classic, a free database provided with WINDEV. The HFSQL Client/Server database will be presented later in this tutorial.
