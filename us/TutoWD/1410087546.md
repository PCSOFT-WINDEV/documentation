## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000269"></a>
The performance profiler (also called Profiler) checks and optimizes the execution time of processes in your application. 

**The principle is straightforward**:

- You test your application.

- During this test, the performance profiler keeps track of all the actions performed and saves the execution times of each one of the processes.




At the end of the test, the performance profiler displays:

- the 10 most time-consuming operations,

- the duration and the number of calls of all processes executed.


The "WD Optimization" project has a specific window that shows examples of results obtained with the performance profiler.

## Starting the performance profiler
<a name="starting_the_performance_profiler_ELTTEXTE000293"></a>
The performance profiler can be started:

- **from the WINDEV editor**:
	In this case, the project is automatically executed in test mode. You can use your application and start the processes of your choice. 
	To go back to the WINDEV editor, simply exit your application..
	The performance profiler displays the result of the analysis. This result is saved in a WPF file.

- **from one of your WLanguage processes**, with the following functions:
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [ProfilerStart](../WDLang1/3013012.md) | Starts "collecting data" for the performance profiler. |
| [ProfilerEnd](../WDLang1/3013002.md) | Stops "collecting data" for the performance profiler. |


	In this case, only the code between [ProfilerStart](../WDLang1/3013012.md) and [ProfilerEnd](../WDLang1/3013002.md) will be analyzed. The result is saved in a WPF file.




- The first method will be used in our example. To start the performance profiler on the "WD Optimization" project:

	1. On the "Project" tab, "Audit and performance" group, expand "Analyze performance" and select "Analyze performance".

| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png) | Note | The performance profiler can also be started from the project dashboard, via the "Performance" widget. To do so:<br><br>		- enable the widget if necessary (click the link "Click here to re-enable").<br><br>		- expand the drop-down arrow and select "Analyze performance". <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P6_Analyseur%20performances%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.jpg)<br><br><br><br> |





	2. The project test is run.

	3. Click the "Test window of performance profiler" button.

	4. Click the "Process to analyze" button.

	5. Validate the information window and stop the project test. The performance profiler report window appears.

## Analyzing the result
<a name="analyzing_the_result_ELTTEXTE000335"></a>


- Let's analyze the report window of the performance profiler. Results are displayed in several tabs:

	- the "Summary" tab shows the ten longest processes.

	- the "Mapping" tab shows a graphical view of the main processes.

	- the "Details" tab shows all the processes run during the test of the application (from the slowest to the fastest).

	- the "Calls" tab shows the details of the operations performed in a process. 







- Let's present these different tabs in our example.

	- The "Summary" tab shows the ten longest processes. In our example, you can see that the local procedure named "UpdateProductStock" takes more than 3 seconds to run. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P6_Analyseur%20performances%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.jpg&type=thumb)


	- The "Mapping" tab shows a graphical view of the elements that took the longest. In our case, it's a call to [Ping](../WDLang1/3014013.md): <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P6_Analyseur%20performances%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.jpg&type=thumb)




- In our case, the "Details" tab indicates that the call to the "Ping" function is one of the elements taking the longest time.

	1. Select this line. We are going to check whether this slowdown is caused by a specific problem.

	2. Click "Calls" to view the details of the calls to the **UpdateProductStock** procedure. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P6_Analyseur%20performances%20-%20HC%20N%B0005.jpg&type=thumb)


	3. Select the "Ping" line and click "Code": the corresponding line of code appears in the editor. 

4. Close the performance profiler. 

5. The following line of code is run:
			
		```wl
		// Checks the accessibility of the supplier server
		Ping("supplier-addr")
		```
The slowdown is caused by the fact that the address specified for [Ping](../WDLang1/3014013.md) is not accessible. 
			|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png) | Note | The code editor shows a "Wrong way" icon to indicate that an error has been found on this line of code at runtime. The details of the error are shown when hovering over the icon. |










- Let's check how the application works when this code is optimized:

	1. Replace the line of code containing [Ping](../WDLang1/3014013.md) by the following line of code:
			
		```wl
		// Checks the accessibility of the supplier server
		Ping(“www.google.com”)
		```


	2. Save the code (Ctrl + S).







- We will restart the performance profiler:

	1. On the "Project" tab, "Audit and performance" group, expand "Analyze performance" and select "Analyze performance".

	2. The project test is run.

	3. Click the "Test window of performance profiler" button.

	4. Click the "Process to analyze" button.

	5. Validate the information window and stop the project test. The performance profiler report window appears.

	6. In the "Mapping" tab, [Ping](../WDLang1/3014013.md) does not appear with the same importance. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P6_Analyseur%20performances%20-%20HC%20N%B0006.jpg&type=thumb)








- Close the performance profiler report window.
