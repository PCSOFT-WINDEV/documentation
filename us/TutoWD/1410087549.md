## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000208"></a>
WINDEV handles the errors automatically. This feature helps you reduce the number of lines of code while centralizing error handling.

The use of this feature also makes the code easier to read.
<a name="NOTE2_2"></a>


### Operating mode
<a name="operating_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000030"></a>

Two operations are performed when a WLanguage function detects an error:

- the function returns an error value (e.g., [fOpen](../WDLang1/3036036.md) returns "-1" if the specified file could not be opened).

- WLanguage detects the error (the ***ErrorOccurred*** variable is set to <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>), and its details can be retrieved using [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md).




This second operation can be automatically managed by the WINDEV error handling system.

### Implementation
<a name="implementation_ELTPARAGRAPHE000052"></a>

The automatic error handling can be configured:

- in the code editor: click the link "If error: By program" in the code editor: ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P7_Gestion%20automatique%20des%20erreurs%20-%20HC%20N%B0004.jpg)


- programmatically with the [ErrorChangeParameter](../WDLang1/3034009.md) function.

### Types of errors
<a name="types_errors_ELTPARAGRAPHE000066"></a>

Two types of errors can occur in WLanguage:

- "non-fatal" errors (also called runtime errors): in most cases, these errors are handled in the code and do not stop the application. For example, opening a file that cannot be accessed or an archive that does not exist.

- "fatal" errors (also called programming errors): in most cases, these errors are linked to a development problem (access to a non-declared file, use of non-existing controls, etc.). A "fatal" error can also occur after a "non-fatal" error that was not processed properly. In this case, the application will be stopped.




The error handling mechanism handles these two types of errors using different methods to set behaviors adapted to the errors encountered.

## Automatic error handling: a training example
<a name="automatic_error_handling_training_example_ELTTEXTE000250"></a>


- To understand the different error cases, we will use a training example provided with WINDEV.

	1. Go to the WINDEV home page (Ctrl + &lt;). 

	2. On the home page, click "Open an example". The list of complete, training and unit examples provided with WINDEV is displayed.

	3. Type "Error" in the search area. Only the examples containing this word are listed.

	4. Double-click "WD Auto Error Management". The project is loaded.




- This project shows how to handle:

	- of a non-fatal error (opening an archive that does not exist).

	- of a fatal error (division by 0).

	- of an error on several levels.







- Test the project (click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_Go_Projet_WB_GAF.jpg)
 in the quick access buttons).

	1. Click "Handle non-fatal errors".

	2. The following window appears. 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P7_Gestion%20automatique%20des%20erreurs%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.jpg&type=thumb)


	3. Click "Test error handling".

4. When running the line of code that triggers the error, an error message is displayed, allowing the user to retry the operation, cancel the operation or stop the application. The "Debug" option should be used: 

	- in test mode, to directly debug the application. 

	- in executable mode, to debug an executable directly from WINDEV.




- Click "Handle fatal errors".

	1. The following window appears. This window is used to check the error when an integer is divided by 0. 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P7_Gestion%20automatique%20des%20erreurs%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.jpg&type=thumb)


	2. Click "Test error handling".

3. When running the line of code that triggers the error, a procedure is automatically called. This procedure displays the error message and stops the current process.

4. Click "OK" and close the window.




- Click "Handle errors on several levels".

	1. The following window appears. This window checks an error on multiple levels (e.g., process calling a procedure that opens an archive that does not exist). 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P7_Gestion%20automatique%20des%20erreurs%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.jpg&type=thumb)


	2. Click "Test error handling".

3. When running the line of code that triggers the error:

	- the procedure returns "False" to the calling process.

	- the calling process displays an error message and stops the process.




- Stop the application test.
