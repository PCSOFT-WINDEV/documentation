## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000320"></a>
This lesson will show you how to print a list of customers, grouped by country and by state or province. 

To do so, we are going to use a table report in order to clearly represent a list of data.

- Open the project you worked on in the previous lesson. 

	1. Go to the WINDEV home page (Ctrl + &lt;).

	2. On the home page, click "Tutorial", then in "Part 4 - Full application with data", double-click "Full application - Exercise".

	3. A dialogue box prompts you to open the project you worked on in the previous lesson. You can open the local copy or the original project. Select "Open the local copy".

## Creating the report
<a name="creating_the_report_ELTTEXTE000362"></a>


- To create a report: 

	1. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_Cr%E9er1_GAF.jpg)
 in the quick access buttons.

	2. The new element window appears: click "Report" then "Report". The report creation wizard starts. The report creation wizard shows several types of reports:  
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Appli%20compl%E8te%20-%20Imprimer%20liste%20clients%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.jpg&type=thumb)


	3. Select "Table". Go to the next step.

4. Select the report data source. The report will be based on the Customer data file. Select "A data file or existing query". 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Appli%20compl%E8te%20-%20Imprimer%20liste%20clients%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.jpg&type=thumb)
Go to the next step.

5. In the list of data files and queries, select "Customer". Go to the next step.

6. Define the data file search key. In our case, the Customer data file will be looped through using the customer's full name. Select the "FullName" search key. 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Appli%20compl%E8te%20-%20Imprimer%20liste%20clients%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.jpg&type=thumb)
Go to the next step.

7. We will now define the data sorting options in the report. By default, the wizard proposes the item used as search key in the data file. Since we want to create a report to list customers by country and by state, we will add a sort on these two items.

8. To add a sort on the country:

	- Click the "Add" button and select "Sort criterion" to add a sort item.

	- In the window that appears, select the Customer.Country item.  ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Appli%20compl%E8te%20-%20Imprimer%20liste%20clients%20-%20HC%20N%B0004.jpg)


The report is completed. We will now test the report to see the result.



- Run the report by clicking ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_GO_Fenetre_WD_GAF.jpg)
 in the quick access buttons. The print destination can be:  ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Appli%20compl%E8te%20-%20Imprimer%20liste%20clients%20-%20HC%20N%B0011.jpg)





- Select "Report viewer" and validate. The report is run and displayed in the report viewer.

You can print the current page or the entire document by clicking the printer ("Print" tab).

## Printing the report through programming
<a name="printing_the_report_through_programming_ELTTEXTE000422"></a>
Once our report is complete, we will create a menu in the "WIN_Menu" window to directly print the report.

- To insert a menu into the "WIN_Menu" window:

	1. Open "WIN_Menu" in the editor (double-click its name in the "Project explorer" pane, for example).

	2. On the "Window" tab, in the "Bars and menus" group, expand "Main menu" and select "Add main menu".

	3. A menu is inserted into the window, below the title bar. This menu contains an option named "Menu".

	4. Select the "Menu" option:

		- Right-click to open the context menu.

		- Select "Add after".




5. In the input area, type "Reports".  
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Appli%20compl%E8te%20-%20Imprimer%20liste%20clients%20-%20HC%20N%B0013.jpg)




- To type the WLanguage code of the "List of customers" option:

	1. Select the "List of customers" option in the editor.

	2. Right-click to open the context menu.

	3. Select "Code". The code editor appears.

	4. Write the following code in the "Selecting the menu" event:
			
		```wl
		// The report is displayed in the report viewer
		iDestination(iViewer)
		
		// Prints the report
		RPT_list_of_customers.Print()
		```
Let's analyze this code:

		- [iDestination](../WDLang5/3046074.md) allows you to configure the print destination. You can generate a report to be printed:

			- in a text file,

			- in HTML format,

			- in PCL format,

			- in PDF, RTF, XLS or XML format,

			- on a fax.


In our case, the report will be generated in the report viewer window.

- [&lt;Report&gt;.Print](../WDLang5/1000024554.md) is used to print reports.




- Test the window and its menu options by clicking ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_GO_Fenetre_WD_GAF.jpg)
 in the quick access buttons.




- We will a menu option to exit the application.

	1. In the editor, select the "Menu" option.

	2. Right-click to open the context menu and select "Transform to expand a submenu".

	3. In the input area that appears, type "Exit".

	4. We are going to associate this menu option with the "Alt + F4" shortcut:

		- Select the "Exit" option.

		- Right-click to open the context menu and select "Option description".

		- In the "General" tab, in the "Keyboard shortcut" area, select "F4" and check "Alt".  
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Appli%20compl%E8te%20-%20Imprimer%20liste%20clients%20-%20HC%20N%B0015.jpg)


		- Validate.

5. Open the WLanguage code of the option and write the following code in the "Selecting the menu" event:
			
		```wl
		// Requires user confirmation to exit the application
		IF YesNo(No, "Exit application?") = Yes THEN
			// End of application
			EndProgram()
		END
		```
Let's take a look at this WLanguage code:

	- [YesNo](../WDLang1/3021005.md) is used to establish a dialog with the user by asking a question. The user can answer the question via 2 buttons: yes or no.

	- [EndProgram](../WDLang1/3013033.md) (called if the user clicks "Yes") is used to end the application.




- Test the window by clicking ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_GO_Fenetre_WD_GAF.jpg)
 in the quick access buttons.
