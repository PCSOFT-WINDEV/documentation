## Overview of "Reports and Queries"
<a name="overview_reports_and_queries_ELTTEXTE000496"></a>
"Reports and Queries" allows users to modify and create the reports and queries in your applications.

Some information is missing in the standard report? "Reports and Queries" allows users to add information from the report viewer . This change may be useful for other users? The report can be made available to all users who use the application in the network. The same principle applies to the queries.|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png) | Note | "Reports and Queries" is free and can be distributed with the applications developed with WINDEV. For more details on distribution and use conditions, see the license. |

<a name="installing_and_using_reports_and_queries_ELTTEXTE000670"></a>


### Installing the application
<a name="installing_the_application_ELTPARAGRAPHE000299"></a>

To test the setup and "Reports and Queries", we will install the "WD Full Application" application.

The setup program of this application was generated in the previous paragraph. The setup program was created in the "Install" subdirectory of the current project.

- In the last setup creation window, click "Test". If you closed this window, run the "Install.exe" program located in the setup program directory. The application setup starts.




- We will go through the different steps of the "WD Full Application" setup program.

	1. If UAC is enabled, a window appears and requests authorization to run the program. Validate this window.

	2. The setup wizard starts. 
			|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png) | Note | You can change the setup language via a combo box at the upper-right corner of the wizard.  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_D%E9ployer%20l'application%20-%20HC%20N%B0008.jpg)<br> |




			Two setup modes are available: 

		- Quick setup: The setup is performed with the parameters specified by the application provider. 

		- Custom setup: The wizard asks the user to define the parameters of the application setup. 




3. Choose "Custom setup". The wizard asks for the application installation directory. 

4. If necessary, select the application installation directory and go to the next step. 

5. The "Reports and Queries" step allows you to install "Reports and Queries". <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Diffuser%20EtatsRequetes%20-%20HC%20N%B0004.jpg&type=thumb)
Select "Install "Reports and Queries "" and specify the installation directory. 
			Remark: If an earlier version of "Reports and Queries" is installed on the computer, it is possible to make a backup copy of that version. 

6. Go to the next step.

7. The next step allows you to define the directories where the reports and queries will be saved (if the option "Allow these directories to be modified during the setup" was checked in the setup program creation wizard).  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Diffuser%20EtatsRequetes%20-%20HC%20N%B0005.jpg&type=thumb)



<a name="NOTE5_2"></a>


### Application test
<a name="application_test_ELTPARAGRAPHE000339"></a>

We will test the application from the user's perspective.

- To test the application:

	1. Start the "WD Full Application" application.

	2. Select "Reports .. List of customers". The report is displayed in the report viewer. Click the "Preview" pane.  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Diffuser%20EtatsRequetes%20-%20HC%20N%B0006.jpg&type=thumb)


	3. Two new icons are displayed on this screen:
			




- We are going to modify this report:

	1. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Diffuser%20EtatsRequetes%20-%20HC%20N%B0006%201%202.jpg).

	2. The report is displayed in edit mode in "Reports and Queries".  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Diffuser%20EtatsRequetes%20-%20HC%20N%B0007.jpg&type=thumb)


	3. Users can make their own changes:

	- on the style of the displayed information (change the color of a control for example).

	- on the content of the report (add a control for example). If the report is linked to a query, the user can modify this query. 

		- If the report is linked to an embedded query, the modification is directly performed in the report. 

		- If the report is linked to an independent query, the query is also modified. Changes will be taken into account when running the report (if a window also uses this query, it won't take the changes into account).




- In this example, we want to highlight the date in red. To do so:

	1. Select the date control in the start of document.

	2. On the "Modification" tab, in the "Quick edit" group, click the "Color" icon. In the window that appears, select the color red and validate. 

	3. Save your report. The default directory corresponds to the application installation directory.

	4. Close "Reports and Queries".

	5. Select "Reports .. List of customers" in the application. The report is displayed in "Report viewer" and the modification is applied.





In this example, the modified report is available to you only. For a network application, the user has the ability to make a modified report available to all the users.

You are now familiar with "Reports and Queries". 
For more details, see [The user report editor (Reports and Queries)](../Presentation/3088004.md).
