## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000145"></a>
The dynamic compilation is used to compile code at any time in the application. For example, your application contains a formula that can be configured. To change the parameters, there is no need to provide the executable again: simply modify a text file.

## Example
<a name="example_ELTTEXTE000169"></a>
The dynamic compilation will be presented via the unit example named "Dynamic compilation".

The "Dynamic compilation" window explains how to dynamically compile WLanguage code (stored in string format), run the procedure that was dynamically generated and process the possible runtime errors.

- To test this window: 

	1. Open the "Dynamic compilation" unit example.

	2. Test the "WIN_DYNAMIC_COMPILATION" window. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P7_Exemple%20compilation%20dynamique%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.jpg&type=thumb)


	3. Click the "Run" buttons to see the different cases.

4. Stop the test.




- Let's go back to the code editor to see the code of the first "Run" button.

	1. Open the code of the "Run" button (right-click the control and select "Code"). This code calls the ***CompileDynamicCode*** procedure.

	2. Move the mouse cursor to the procedure name and press F2. The WLanguage code of the procedure is automatically displayed in the code editor.
			The code of this procedure can be divided into several sections:

		1. Initializing variables.

		2. Compiling the code.
						
			```wl
			sCompilationResult = Compile(DYNAMIC_PROCEDURE, EDT_COMPIL_CODE)
			```
This code contains several important points:

			- The function is compiled by the [Compile](../WDLang1/3013015.md) WLanguage function. The dynamically compiled function can be used once the function is called (if no error is returned).

			- This function expects two parameters: the name of the compiled procedure ("DYNAMIC_PROCEDURE") and the code to compile. In this case, the code to compile is in the EDT_COMPIL_CODE Edit control.

			- The compilation result is assigned to a sCompilationResult string.




3. Checking the compilation result.
						
			```wl
			// Checks the compilation result
			SWITCH sCompilationResult
				// No error
				CASE “”
					bCompilationResult = True
					STC_ERROR_COMPILED_CODE = ""
					
				// Fatal compilation error
				CASE “ERR”
					bCompilationResult = False
					STC_ERROR_COMPILED_CODE = ErrorInfo()
				// Incorrect code
				OTHER CASE
					bCompilationResult = False
					STC_ERROR_COMPILED_CODE = sCompilationResult
			END
			```


3. Press Ctrl + F2. The "Click" event of the "Run" button appears again in the code editor. In the rest of this code, you can see that the function that is dynamically compiled is run by [Execute](../WDLang1/3013041.md).
