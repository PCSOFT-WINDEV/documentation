## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000154"></a>
Installing a Client/Server application requires several specific options. These options are supported by WINDEV's setup creation wizard.

We are going to create the setup procedure of "WD Full Application". 

- Open the project you worked on in the previous lesson. 

	1. Go to the WINDEV home page (Ctrl + &lt;).

	2. On the home page, click "Tutorial", then in "Part 5 - Manage an HFSQL Client/Server database", double-click "Full application - Exercise".

	3. A dialogue box prompts you to open the project you worked on in the previous lesson. You can open the local copy or the original project. Select "Open the local copy".

3. Click the "Data" option on the left side of the wizard: the "Database options" step is displayed. In this step, several options are specific to applications in Client/Server mode. For example, you can:

	- Include the setup of an HFSQL server,

	- Configure the location of the application data files,

	- Deploy the data files on an HFSQL server.

 If these options are checked, the next steps allow you to set the elements that will be taken into account for the setup on end-user computers.
