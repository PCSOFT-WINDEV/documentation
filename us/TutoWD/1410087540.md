## Overview

WINDEV allows you to create applications accessing HFSQL Client/Server databases. 

The Client/Server mode lets you migrate databases to a server. 

This operating mode: 

- increases data security, 

- allows you to easily manage the multi-user mode, 

- simplifies maintenance,

WINDEV allows you to:

- create an entire application using an HFSQL Client/Server database.

- modify an application that uses an HFSQL Classic database so that it can use an HFSQL Client/Server database.

## Why switch an application to HFSQL Client/Server mode?
<a name="why_switch_application_hfsql_clientserver_mode_ELTTEXTE000155"></a>
The main advantages of an HFSQL Client/Server application over HFSQL Classic are as follows:

- HFSQL Client/Server is more secure (you can create a username and password and grant rights to the users).

- No need to manage directories: all database files are in the same folder.

- The end users do not see the data files in the explorer and they cannot access them directly.

- The databases in Client/Server mode can be used via an Internet connection.

- Management of native multi-user mode: performance is optimized in multi-user mode.
