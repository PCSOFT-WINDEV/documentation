## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000190"></a>
To use an Informix database with the Native Connector, **the structure of Informix tables must be imported into the WINDEV or WEBDEV analysis**. 

**Differences compared to SQL programming**: The queries are not required to handle the Informix data. Indeed, the HFSQL functions can be directly used to read data, perform searches, implement filters, ... However, the structure of Informix files must be imported into the WINDEV or WEBDEV analysis.

## Importing the structure of files

### The import steps
<a name="the_import_steps_ELTPARAGRAPHE000022"></a>

To perform this import: 

1. Start the data model editor: click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Ico_Analyse.gif)
 in the quick access buttons.

2. On the "Analysis" tab, in the "Creation" group, expand "Import" and select "Import file/table descriptions...".

3. The wizard starts. A connection to the Informix database is automatically established and associated with the files imported into the analysis. This connection will be used to handle the Informix data file through programming.




In the different steps of the wizard, choose the following options:

- Type of database: Informix. 

- Characteristics of the connection: Data server, User and password, database.  

- The application will access the data in the current format.

- When the connection is established, all you have to do is select the tables that will be imported into the WINDEV or WEBDEV analysis. These tables can be handled through programming with the HFSQL functions of WLanguage. These tables will be displayed in blue in the data model editor.

### Taking into account the evolution of the Informix database
<a name="taking_into_account_the_evolution_the_informix_database_ELTPARAGRAPHE000054"></a>

To take into account the evolutions of the tables imported into the data model editor, go to the "Analysis" tab, "Analysis" group, expand "Synchronization" and select "Update analysis from external databases".

A wizard starts, allowing you to:

- analyze the differences for the imported tables

- analyze the differences for the all the Informix tables.

## Programming
<a name="programming_ELTTEXTE000250"></a>


### 1. Opening the connection
<a name="1_opening_the_connection_ELTPARAGRAPHE000080"></a>

To open the connection to the Informix database, use [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md) and specify the name of the connection to be opened. The connection name was defined when importing the structure of files into the analysis.

To modify some parameters of this connection (username or password for example), call [HConnect](../WDLang4/3044263.md).

**Remark**: If you try to read the data file directly ([HReadFirst](../WDLang4/3044051.md), ...), the connection associated with the file description in the analysis will be automatically opened.

### 2. Running queries
<a name="2_running_queries_ELTPARAGRAPHE000100"></a>

[HExecuteQuery](../WDLang4/3044080.md) and [HExecuteSQLQuery](../WDLang4/3044084.md) are used to run queries on the current database.

- [HExecuteQuery](../WDLang4/3044080.md): is used to run a preset query with the query editor.

- [HExecuteSQLQuery](../WDLang4/3044084.md): is used to run a query by specifying the SQL code of the query and the name that will be assigned to this SQL code.



```wl
// Initialize the "Customer_84" query
HExecuteQuery(CUSTOMER_84, "InformixDatabase", hQueryWithoutCorrection)
HExecuteSQLQuery(QryCustomer, hQueryWithoutCorrection, ...
	"SELECT NAME FROM CUSTOMER", "InformixDatabase")
```

<a name="NOTE3_3"></a>


### 3. Retrieving the result
<a name="3_retrieving_the_result_ELTPARAGRAPHE000121"></a>

The result is browsed by the standard read functions: [HReadFirst](../WDLang4/3044051.md), [HReadNext](../WDLang4/3044037.md), [HReadSeek](../WDLang4/3044050.md), ...

**Remark**: The *hLockWrite* and *hLockReadWrite* constants are ignored. Indeed, the read and/or write locks are not supported by the Native Connector.
<a name="NOTE3_4"></a>


### 4. Closing the connection
<a name="4_closing_the_connection_ELTPARAGRAPHE000139"></a>

[HCloseConnection](../WDLang4/3044095.md) is used to close the connection to the database once all the necessary queries have been run.
