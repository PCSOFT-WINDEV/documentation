## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000223"></a>
WINDEV and WEBDEV 28 include a Native MariaDB Connector (also called Native MariaDB Access). This Native Connector allows you to access a MariaDB database from a WLanguage program without using any external driver.

**Caution**: This version of the Native MariaDB Connector works with WINDEV and WEBDEV version 28.

**Remark**: The Native MariaDB Connector is an optional and free module available for download from [the PC SOFT site](https://www.windev.com)

### Conditions for Native MariaDB Connectors
<a name="conditions_for_native_mariadb_connectors_ELTPARAGRAPHE000030"></a>



- WINDEV 28 or WEBDEV 28.

- MariaDB client layer (libmariadb.DLL file)

	- 32-bit client layer to use the 32-bit Native MariaDB Connector (version 3.x.x to 10.x.x tested).

	- 64-bit client layer to use the 64-bit Native MariaDB Connector (version 10.x.x tested).




- The ***LibMariaDB.DLL*** DLL must be:

	- On the development computer: 

		- in the "\\Programs\\Framework\\Win32x86" directory of the setup directory of WINDEV or WEBDEV (32-bit).

		- in the "\\Programs\\Framework\\Win64x86" directory of the setup directory of WINDEV or WEBDEV (64-bit).




- On the deployment computer, in the executable directory or in the Windows directory. For a deployment on a Web server, the DLL must be found in the directory of the Native Connector or in the Windows directory.

### Required files
<a name="required_files_ELTPARAGRAPHE000056"></a>

The following files are required to use Native MariaDB Connector:

- The ***LibMariaDB.DLL*** DLL. This DLL is distributed with MariaDB. For more details, see the license of MariaDB about the distribution conditions of this DLL.

	- 32-bit file to use the 32-bit Native MariaDB Connector.

	- 64-bit file to use the 64-bit Native MariaDB Connector. 




- The ***wd280maria.dll*** DLL: Required for the 64-bit Native Connector to a MariaDB database. This file is provided with the Native MariaDB Connector for WINDEV and/or WEBDEV.

- The ***wd280maria64.dll*** DLL: Required for the 64-bit Native Connector to a MariaDB database. This file is provided with the Native MariaDB Connector for WINDEV and/or WEBDEV.




To debug a multi-configuration project in 32-bit and 64-bit configuration: 

- copy the 32-bit libmariadb DLL to the EXE subfolder of the 32-bit project configuration. 

- copy the 64-bit libmariadb DLL to the EXE subfolder of the 64-bit project configuration.

### Installing a new version of MariaDB
<a name="installing_new_version_mariadb_ELTPARAGRAPHE000081"></a>

The dialog between Native MariaDB Connector and MariaDB uses the LibMariaDB.DLL DLL supplied with MariaDB. 
The Native Connector may no longer operate if the behavior of this DLL is modified (when changing version for example).

An upgraded version that takes these changes into account will be available soon ; meanwhile, all you have to do is use the previous version of LibMariaDB.DLL. This DLL will operate with the new version of MariaDB, while still being compatible with the Native Connector.

### Files required to use Native MariaDB Connector in Linux
<a name="files_required_use_native_mariadb_connector_linux_ELTPARAGRAPHE000094"></a>

To use Native MariaDB Connector in Linux, the following operations must be performed:

**1.** Install the MariaDB client layer on the server. Check whether the ***libmariadbclient.so*** DLL was copied to /usr/lib.

Remark: 

- The 32-bit MariaDB client layer must be installed to use the 32-bit Native MariaDB Connector. 

- The 64-bit MariaDB client layer must be installed to use the 64-bit Native MariaDB Connector. If the copied DLLs are such as libmariadbClient.so.12.0.0, a link must be created on this DLL via the following line of code:





```txt
ln -s libmariadbclient.so.12.0.0 libmariadbclient.so
```


**2.** If you are using a WEBDEV site, copy the following DLLs into the directory of WEBDEV Application Server:

- wd280hf.so: HFSQL library

- wd280maria.so: library of 32-bit native connector

- wd280maria64.so: library of 64-bit native connector

- wd280sql.so: SQL library




**3.** If you are using a Linux batch application, copy the following DLLs into the application directory:

- wd280hf.so: HFSQL library

- wd280maria.so: library of 32-bit native connector

- wd280maria64.so: library of 64-bit native connector

- wd280sql.so: SQL library

## Use

### Using Native MariaDB Connector in your WINDEV applications and WEBDEV sites
<a name="using_native_mariadb_connector_your_windev_applications_and_webdev_sites_ELTPARAGRAPHE000142"></a>

To use Native MariaDB Connector, you must program in the WINDEV application or in the WEBDEV site:

- with the "SQL" functions of WLanguage (see [Programming with SQL functions](../WDMariaDB/1000021529.md)).

- with the "HFSQL" functions of WLanguage (see [Programming with HFSQL functions](../WDMariaDB/1000021528.md)).


**Remarks**: 

- Don't forget to read the [limitations regarding the use of Native MariaDB Connector.](../WDMariaDB/1000021521.md)

- The option "Automatically create the data files when they are opened" ("Files" tab in the project description) is taken into account by the Native MariaDB Connector.

### Optimizing HFSQL functions
<a name="optimizing_hfsql_functions_ELTPARAGRAPHE000173"></a>

- **The "Browsing table" controls based on queries are optimized**: the content of the Table control can be sorted by clicking one of its columns.

- To avoid re-running the same query several times when browsing its result, we advise you to use the ***hNoRefresh*** constant (if the data is modified by a single computer for example).
