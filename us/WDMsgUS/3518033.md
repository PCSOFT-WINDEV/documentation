## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000218"></a>
A project was already created and translated.

You have added new elements (windows, pages, reports, etc.) and/or modified existing elements. 
In this case, there is no need to extract all messages: simply extract the messages that correspond to new elements and/or modified elements. 
You can extract the added or modified messages: the new extraction file will contain all messages added and modified since the last extraction.

### Extracting messages added or modified since last extraction
<a name="extracting_messages_added_modified_since_last_extraction_ELTPARAGRAPHE000026"></a>

To extract messages added or modified since the last extraction:

1. Open your project in WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile: on the "Home" tab, in the "General" group, expand "Open" and select "Open a project".

2. Start WDMSG: on the "Project" tab, in the "Translate" group, expand "Translate" and select "Extract messages".

3. Select the languages of the messages to extract. These languages correspond to the languages already available in the project, to be translated into other languages. 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Assistant%20WDMSG%20-%20HC%20N%B0011.gif&type=thumb)
The languages proposed are those defined in the "Languages" tab of the project description. 
	Remarks:

	- The name of custom languages is also proposed. 

	- To open the project description, go to the "Project" tab, "Project" group and click "Description".

	- To select multiple extraction languages, use Ctrl and/or Shift.




4. Go to the next step of the wizard.

5. If you have selected multiple languages, specify the reference language, i.e. the language used during the development phase. Messages from this reference language must be translated into other languages. 

6. Go to the next step of the wizard.  

7. Select the different elements (windows, pages, reports...) whose messages (caption, code message...) must be extracted.

Remark: If the elements of your project are grouped by custom-folders, the elements proposed by WDMSG will also be grouped by custom-folders. 

8. Go to the next step.

9. Choose the type of file to generate:

	- WDMSG archive. This type of file can only be used to translate text with WDTRAD. 

- HFSQL file. This type of file can only be used to translate text with WDTRAD.  

- Text file. This type of file can be used to perform a translation with WDTRAD or with another translation software. 

10. Go to the next step.

11. Select the parameters of result file, created by the extraction (see [Details of parameters](#NOTE2_2)).

12. Go to the next step.

13. Select "Extract the modified or added messages only".
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Assistant%20WDMSG%20-%20HC%20N%B0014.gif&type=thumb)


14. Specify the initial extraction file (messages neither translated nor corrected) and the new extraction file that will only contain the new or modified messages.
	The extraction file is created in the selected directory (project directory by default).
	This file can be translated with a specific translation software (text file only) or with [WDTRAD](../WDTrad/3518010.md), the translation tool included with WDMSG. 

15. Validate.

### Extraction parameters
<a name="extraction_parameters_ELTPARAGRAPHE000114"></a>

The extraction parameters common to all extraction file types are as follows:

- **Keep the hotkey indicator ("&") in the extracted messages**: this parameter allows you to include the "&" character in the captions of controls to specify the control hotkey.
	Reminder: This hotkey is used to directly position on the control at runtime by pressing Alt + Letter. In the control caption, any letter preceded by the "&" character automatically becomes the control "hotkey".

- **Transform hard-coded strings into multilingual strings**: Two types of character strings are found in the code:

	- *multilingual character strings*. An icon appears next to these strings:![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=MessageMultilangue.gif)


	- *non-multilingual ("hard coded") strings*. These strings are enclosed in quotes.![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=MessageNonMultilangue.gif)

- **Convert to OEM format (ANSI by default)**: if this option is enabled, the extraction file will use OEM characters (DOS character set, usable with a DOS software). Otherwise, ANSI characters will be used (Windows character set, usable with a Windows software).




You can also define parameters specific to your own translation software (see next paragraph).

### Extraction parameters for a translation software
<a name="extraction_parameters_for_translation_software_ELTPARAGRAPHE000137"></a>

The following parameters are not required if you are using [WDTRAD](../WDTrad/3518010.md) to translate the messages found in your project.

If you are using another translation software, specific parameters must be defined (these parameters may differ according to the software used). The parameters specific to the translation software used are as follows:

- **Add a delimiter for the text sections not to translate**: with some translation software, sections of text can be ignored in the document to translate. For example, the comments generated by WDMSG can be ignored. To do so, the text sections to ignore must be enclosed in delimiters (specific to the software).
	If this option is enabled, all the sections of text specific to the format of the extraction file will be enclosed in delimiters (SSTRX by default) and they will not be translated.
	For more details, see the documentation about the translation software.

- **Add a space before the delimiter**: with some translation software, a space must be added before the delimiter. 
	If this option is enabled, a space character is added before the delimiter.

- **Add a space after the delimiter**: with some translation software, a space character must be added after the delimiter. 
	If this option is enabled, a space character is added after the delimiter.

- **Add additional information in comment**: if this option is enabled, comment lines will be added into the created extraction file. These lines are used to find out the origin of messages (messages associated with a control, a window, ...).

### Message text file format
<a name="message_text_file_format_ELTPARAGRAPHE000166"></a>

The extraction file created by WDMSG uses a specific format. For more details, see [format of text files of messages](../WDMsg/3518030.md).
