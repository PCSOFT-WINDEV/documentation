## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000291"></a>
All the text form the translation file can be reintegrated into a project.

The translation file (containing the translated or modified text) must be in the same format as the extraction file created with WDMSG ("Message extraction" or "List of untranslated messages").

**Remarks**:

- Several points must be checked before reintegrating the messages (see notes).

- If changes have been made to the initial extraction file created by WDMSG, it must be reintegrated to apply such changes.




**Elements (windows, pages, reports, etc.) supporting more languages than the project:**
WDMSG only lists the languages supported by the current project. If some elements (windows, pages, reports, etc.) support more languages than the project, the translations for these additional languages will not be reintegrated.

Make sure the project supports the language in which the text will be reintegrated. If necessary, you can add new languages in the "Languages" tab of the project description. 
Reminder: To open the project description, go to the "Project" tab, "Project" group and click "Description".

### Reintegrating text into a project
<a name="reintegrating_text_into_project_ELTPARAGRAPHE000047"></a>

To reintegrate translated or modified text into your project:

1. Open your project in WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile: on the "Home" tab, in the "General" group, expand "Open" and select "Open a project".

2. Start WDMSG: on the "Project" tab, in the "Translate" group, expand "Translate" and select "Reintegrate messages".

3. Select the languages in which the text will be reintegrated.

Remarks: 

	- The names of the custom languages also appear in the list. 

	- Multiple language selection is available for HFSQL or WDMSG translation files only. The resources to translate are previously extracted to the translation file and translated with WDTRAD. 

	- The "Use another available language if a translation is empty." option is used to avoid blank spaces in the interface. You can then select the language that will be used if the translation is empty. Thus, if this option is enabled, when a resource is not found in the reintegrated language, it is searched in the specified language. If after this search, the resource is still not found, the resource is kept in the source language.  

	- To reintegrate a language that was initially not supported in the project, select "Reintegrate an additional language external to the project". Simply specify that language to be reintegrated.  




4. Go to the next step of the wizard.

5. Select the reintegration options of the file containing the translated text. These options are presented in the paragraph below.  
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Assistant%20WDMSG%20-%20HC%20N%B0006.gif&type=thumb)


6. Go to the next step.

7. When reintegrating text, you can check whether the text of the current project matches previously extracted text. This feature is useful when the text is translated while the application is being developed.
	After this verification, the translation of the text that has been edited in the project will not be reintegrated. The text that has been edited will be extracted and saved in a new file. 
	To perform this verification:

	- check "Check whether messages have been modified since their extraction".

	- specify the initial extraction file (with the text that has not been translated or modified) and the new extraction file that contains only the edited text. 
			Go to the next step.

	- select the initial extraction language.
			Go to the next step.




8. When the text is reintegrated, you can also reintegrate corrections (spelling mistakes, etc.) made in the initial extraction file. This feature is useful when translators make corrections to the source text of the initial file. The translations and the corrections made to the source text can be reintegrated. 
	To perform this reintegration:

	- check "Reintegrate changes made to the source text".

	- specify the initial extraction file containing the corrections.

	- select the initial extraction language.


 Go to the next step.

9. WDMSG gives you the ability to create a reference file. This file will only contain new text or the text that has been edited since the last time the text was translated. 
	To create a reference file:

	- check "Extract a reference file".

	- specify the reference file.

	- select the language of the reference file.


 Go to the next step.

10. Validate. Messages are reintegrated. If you specified other operations, the corresponding files will be processed and generated. 
	You can check the reintegration directly in the tool used (in WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile).
	For example, view the description of an Edit control. The translation of the control caption will be available.

### Reintegration options
<a name="reintegration_options_ELTPARAGRAPHE000153"></a>

In most cases, you must define the same options to extract and reintegrate the text of a project. The reintegration options are as follows:

- **Reintegrate in OEM format**: if the option is enabled, the text of the file must be in OEM format (format of DOS characters); otherwise, in ANSI format (format of Windows characters).




You can also define options specific to the translation software used (see next paragraph).

### Reintegration options for a translation software
<a name="reintegration_options_for_translation_software_ELTPARAGRAPHE000166"></a>

The following options are not required if you are using [WDTRAD](../WDTrad/3518010.md) to translate the text of your project.

If you use another translation software, you need to define specific options (these options may vary depending on the software used). In most cases, you must define the same options to extract and reintegrate the text of a project. The options to be defined based on the translation software used are as follows:

- **Consider the delimiter of sections of text not to be translated**: with some translation software, sections of text can be ignored in the document to translate. For example, the comments generated by WDMSG can be ignored. To do so, the text sections to ignore must be enclosed in delimiters (specific to the software).
	If this option is enabled, all the sections of text specific to the format of the extraction file will be enclosed in delimiters (SSTRX by default) and will not be translated.
	For more details on delimiters, see the documentation of the translation software used.

- **Consider the space before the delimiter**: with some translation software, a space must be added before the delimiter. 
	If this option is enabled, a space is added before the delimiter.

- **Consider the space after the delimiter**: with some translation software, a space must be added after the delimiter. 
	If this option is enabled, a space is added after the delimiter.

### Before reintegrating the text
<a name="before_reintegrating_the_text_ELTPARAGRAPHE000194"></a>

Before reintegrating the text, make sure that:

- a project backup was made in WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile. To make a backup, go to the "Project" tab, "Other actions" group, expand "Backup/Restore" and select "Make a project backup".
	**Important**: WDMSG does not create a backup file.

- in the case of a translation text file: the keywords of the extraction file were not modified when the file was translated or checked (otherwise, an error message will appear when the text is reintegrated).

- the target language has been defined in the project. Otherwise, you must: 

	- add the language in the "Languages" tab of the project description: on the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, click "Description".

	- update the project before reintegrating the text: on the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, expand "Recompile and synchronize" and select "Repair project".




- when reintegrating multiple languages at the same time (HFSQL or WDMSG file): the different languages in the translation file have been translated in WDTRAD.
