## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000108"></a>
WDAPI is used to convert a declaration of C function or structure into a declaration of WLanguage function or structure. It allows you to easily retrieve an existing C code and to convert it into WLanguage.

**Reminder**: WDAPI can be started from WDTool: on the "Tools" tab, in the "Utilities" group, click "WDTool".

### Converting a declaration of C function or structure into a declaration of WLanguage structure
<a name="converting_declaration_function_structure_into_declaration_wlanguage_structure_ELTPARAGRAPHE000032"></a>

To convert a declaration of C function or structure into a declaration of WLanguage structure:

1. Select the "Convert C into WLanguage" pane.

2. To convert a declaration of C function, enter the code of this function in "Prototype of the function in C".
	To convert a declaration of C structure, enter the code of this structure in "Structure in C".

3. Click the arrow (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=fleche.gif)
) found below the corresponding control.

4. The corresponding WLanguage code is automatically generated. This code can be copied into your WLanguage program (see the next paragraph).


**Rare case:** Some specific features linked to a structure or to a function of the Windows API may not be interpreted properly by WDAPI. In this case, the conversion must be performed by yourself.

To copy the declaration code of C structure converted into WLanguage:

1. Convert the code.

2. Click the "Copy" button associated with the declaration code of WLanguage syntax or structure.

3. In your WINDEV project, go to the desired process or event:

	- project initialization (recommended).

	- declaration of global variables of the window.

	- declaration of global variables of the set of procedures in which the API function is called.




4. In the code editor, select "Paste" in the context menu (or press Ctrl + V).
