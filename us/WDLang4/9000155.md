## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000121"></a>
To convert an HFSQL Classic database into an HFSQL Client/Server database, WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile propose two methods: 

- [Use the data model editor](#NOTE2_1) to directly modify the type of data files: switching from the HFSQL Classic type (data file in a directory) to an HFSQL Client/Server type (connection to an HFSQL server). 

- [Use the HFSQL Control Center](#NOTE3_1) to directly convert an HFSQL Classic database to HFSQL Client/Server.

## Conversion in the data model editor
<a name="conversion_the_data_model_editor_ELTTEXTE000145"></a>
To convert an HFSQL Classic database to HFSQL Client/Server: 

1. Load the project and open the analysis containing the data files to convert. 

2. Select a data file to convert in the data model editor. 

3. In the context menu, select "Data file description". 

4. In the window that is displayed, modify the type of the file: select "HFSQL Client/Server". <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Convertir_HFSQLClassic%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif&type=thumb)


5. The wizard for creating a connection starts. 

6. Enter the name of the HFSQL server or its IP address. 

7. Enter the username and password (the first time you log in, enter "Admin" and leave the password empty). 

8. Choose or enter the name of the database to which the current data file will be copied. 

9. The connection is created. 

10. The wizard proposes to associate the created connection with other data files found in the analysis. By default, all the data files are selected. You can uncheck those you do not want to convert.

11. The wizard proposes to copy the data files onto the HFSQL server. 




Once the operation is complete, the data files in HFSQL C/S mode appear in yellow in the data model editor.

## Conversion in the HFSQL Control Center

To convert an HFSQL Classic database to HFSQL Client/Server: 

1. Open the HFSQL Control Center. 

2. Connect to an existing HFSQL server ("Admin" user without password by default). 

3. Select the server. In the server characteristics pane, in the "Database" group, click "Import an HFSQL Classic database". <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Convertir_HFSQLClassic%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif&type=thumb)


4. The import wizard starts. 

5. Specify the directory where your HFSQL Classic data files are located. 

6. Enter the name of a target database or click the "New" button to create a new database.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Convertir_HFSQLClassic%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.gif)


7. Localize the analysis (which means the description of data files to convert). This step is optional but it allows you to retrieve the description of links and integrity rules between data files.

8. Check the list of data files to convert and start the conversion.

9. The "Connection code" is used to retrieve, via the clipboard, the code for connecting to the HFSQL Client/Server database. For example: 
	
	```wl
	HDescribeConnection("HyperFileCS", "admin", "<password>", ...
			"localhost:4900", "CRMDATABASE", hAccessHFClientServer)
	HChangeConnection("*", "HyperFileCS")
	```



Remark: The data file names are not modified during the conversion.

## Note
<a name="note_ELTTEXTE000193"></a>
Once the database is converted, don't forget to include the connection code in the existing project in order to change the type of connection through programming. For example, the connection code can be copied into the project code.
Example of connection code: 

```wl
ConnectionName is Connection

// Connection parameters
ConnectionName.Provider = hAccessHFClientServer
ConnectionName.User = "UserName"
ConnectionName.Password = "Password"
ConnectionName.Server = "Myserver:port"
ConnectionName.Database = "MyDatabase"
ConnectionName.CryptMethod = hEncryptionNO

// Open the connection
HOpenConnection(ConnectionName)

HChangeConnection("*", ConnectionName)
```
