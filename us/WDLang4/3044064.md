Transforms the crossed records ([HCross](../WDLang4/3044121.md)) found in a data file into deleted records. The space occupied by the crossed records is freed and it can be re-used during the next additions ([HAdd](../WDLang4/3044147.md)).

**Reminder**: A crossed record is inactive and it disappears from the index. The data found in this crossed record is not deleted (unlike [HDelete](../WDLang4/3044018.md)).
