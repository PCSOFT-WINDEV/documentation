<a name="Use"></a>
<a name="description"></a>
Moves backward several records from the current position in the data file, according to a specified item.

The destination record is read and loaded in memory: the HFSQL variables are updated (Customer.Name for example, which means the *Name* item of *Customer* file).

Several cases may occur after the call to **HBackward**:

- no other record exists in the data file: [HOut](../WDLang4/3044094.md) returns <u><u><u>True</u></u></u>. No read operation is performed.

- the function tries to lock a record that is already locked in read-only: [HErrorLock](../WDLang4/3044099.md) returns <u><u><u>True</u></u></u> and [HOut](../WDLang4/3044094.md) returns <u><u><u>True</u></u></u>.
	
	![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Access by JDBC: The management of locks is not available for databases accessed by JDBC.




This function can be used with the data files, HFSQL views or queries.

## Example


```wl
// Go back to the 200th record of the Customer data file
// according to the CustName key
HReadLast(Customer, CustName)
HBackward(Customer, CustName, 199)
```

## Syntax

`<Result> = HBackward([<Data file> [, <Item>] [, <Step> [, <Options>]]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the backward move was performed in the data file,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if an error occurred (lock, end of file, etc.): the record is not read. [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) is used to identify the error.




**`<Data file>: (Optional character string)`**

Name of the data file, view or query used. If this name is not specified, **HBackward** will use the last data file used by the last HFSQL function (function starting with "H").

**`<Item>: (Optional character string)`**

Name of item according to which the browse is performed. If this name is not specified, **HBackward** handles the last item in the data file used by the last HFSQL function (function starting with "H").
![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) All the items used to move backward in the file are considered as being key items.

**`<Step>: (Optional integer)`**

Number of steps backward (which means number of records to browse). By default, &lt;Step> = 1.

**`<Options>: (Optional Integer constant (or combination of constants))`**

Configures:

- the lock mode applied to the record read. By default, the lock performed corresponds to the current lock.
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hLockNo* | No lock: the record can be read or modified by another application during the reading. |
| *hLockReadWrite* | Lock in read/write: the record currently read cannot be read or modified by another application. |
| *hLockWrite* | Lock in write mode: the record currently read can be read by another application but it cannot be modified by another application. |


	![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) The lock options will have no effect if the locks are not supported by the OLE DB provider or by the Native Connector.

- the management of duplicates during the browse. By default, all the duplicates are browsed.
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hDistinct* | When a browse is performed on a key item, a single record is browsed if duplicates are found. |

## Remarks


### Read operation according to a key item or not
<a name="read_operation_according_key_item_not_ELTPARAGRAPHE000195"></a>

In all cases, the browse operation must have been initialized by one of the following functions: [HReadFirst](../WDLang4/3044051.md), [HFirst](../WDLang4/3044113.md), [HReadSeekFirst](../WDLang4/3044036.md), [HSeekFirst](../WDLang4/3044125.md), [HChangeKey](../WDLang4/3044151.md), [HRestorePosition](../WDLang4/3044137.md).

If the item used is a key item:

- if the *hDistinct* constant is not enabled, **HBackward** moves backward of &lt;Step&gt; key values from the current position.

- if the *hDistinct* constant is enabled, **HBackward** moves backward of &lt;Step&gt; distinct key values from the current position. If duplicates are found, a single duplicate is read.




If the item used is not a key item:

- the *hDistinct* constant is not available, 

- **HBackward** moves backward of &lt;Step&gt; active records from the current position.

### Memos
<a name="memos_ELTPARAGRAPHE000238"></a>

The memos associated with the record can be automatically read (or not) when reading the record. [HSetMemo](../WDLang4/3044139.md) is used to customize this automatic read operation.

If the memos are supported, the associated text memos are read when the record is read. The binary memos are read only when they are explicitly used ([HExtractMemo](../WDLang4/3044072.md)).
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Miscellaneous
<a name="miscellaneous_ELTPARAGRAPHE000255"></a>

- The result of [HReadSeekLast](../WDLang4/3044034.md) must be ignored ([HReadSeekFirst](../WDLang4/3044036.md) must be used for the searches performed by [HFound](../WDLang4/3044104.md), [HFound](../WDLang4/3044104.md), [HReadSeek](../WDLang4/3044050.md)).

- The current record number is returned by [HRecNum](../WDLang4/3044063.md).

- **HBackward** respects the current active filter (defined by [HFilter](../WDLang4/3044100.md)).

- [HChangeKey](../WDLang4/3044151.md) is used modify the search key while being positioned on the current record.

- **HBackward**(Customer,Name) is equivalent to [HReadPrevious](../WDLang4/3044048.md)(Customer,Name)

### Lock
<a name="lock_ELTPARAGRAPHE000300"></a>

By default (no lock variable specified), the lock performed corresponds to the current lock mode.

If a lock is requested (*hLockWrite* or *hLockReadWrite* constant), the record will be read and locked only if this record is not already locked by another application.
