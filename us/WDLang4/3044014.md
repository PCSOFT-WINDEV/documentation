<a name="description"></a>
Synchronizes the master replica and the subscriber replica: the operations performed on one of the replicas are transferred into the other replica.

**This function can be used in a log-based replication (between HFSQL data files) or a universal replication.**

**Remarks**:

- For a log-based replication, only the data files in the analysis with the option "Manage the replication for this file" checked will be taken into account.

- ![HFSQL Client/Server](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HFCS.png) Only the universal replication operates with the HFSQL Client/Server data files.

- ![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) Only the universal replication is available. 





	<B><B><B>Warning</B></B></B>

	From version <B><B><B>17</B></B></B>, the replication files created with an application or a site in version 17 (or later) cannot be handled by an application or a site in version 16 (or earlier).
The applications or the sites in version 17 (or later) continue to handle the replication files created with an application or a site in version 16 (or earlier).

## Syntax

### Synchronization with automatic conflict management

`<Result> = HSynchronizeReplica(<Master replica> , <Subscriber replica> , <Replication direction> [, <Management of conflicts>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the operation was successful,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise.




**`<Master replica>: (Character string)`**

Location of the master replica. Depending on the replication type and direction, this parameter can correspond to:

- the path of the replication file (xxxx.RPM file) for the master database.

- the name of the movable file created by [HCreateMovableReplica](../WDLang4/3044209.md). 

- an empty string (""). The current data files are considered as the master database. The file corresponding to the master replica (.RPM) is sought either in the replication directory specified in the analysis (RPL subdirectory of data files by default), or in the directory specified with [HChangeRplDir](../WDLang4/3044236.md).




In most cases, this path corresponds either to the full path of a file located in a network directory, or to the path of a movable replica (USB key, email attachment, file retrieved by FTP).
For more details, see [the remarks](#NOTE0_1).

**`<Subscriber replica>: (Character string)`**

Location of the subscriber replica. Depending on the replication type and direction, this parameter can correspond to:

- the path of replication file (xxxx.RPL file) for the subscriber database.

- the name of the movable file created by [HCreateMovableReplica](../WDLang4/3044209.md)

- an empty string (""). The current data files are considered as being the subscriber database. The file corresponding to the subscriber replica (.RPL)  is sought either in the replication directory specified in the analysis (RPL subdirectory of data files by default), or in the directory specified by [HChangeRplDir](../WDLang4/3044236.md).




In most cases, this path corresponds either to the full path of a file located in a network directory, or to the path of a movable replica (USB key, email attachment, file retrieved by FTP).
For more details, see [the remarks](#NOTE0_1).

**`<Replication direction>: (Integer constant)`**

Direction in which the replication will be performed:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *rplBidirectional* | Update the master database AND the subscriber database.<br><br>**Universal replication**: the bidirectional replication is not available. |
| *rplToMaster* | Update the master database according to the subscriber database.<br><br>&lt;Master replica&gt; corresponds to the master replica, &lt;Subscriber replica&gt; corresponds to the movable replica created from the subscriber database. |
| *rplToSubscriber* | Update the subscriber database according to the master database.<br><br>&lt;Master replica&gt; corresponds to the movable replica created from the master database, &lt;Subscriber replica&gt; corresponds to the subscriber replica |



**`<Management of conflicts>: (Optional Integer constant)`**

Constant indicating the management mode of conflicts:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *rplMasterFirst*<br>(Default value) | The data found in the master database has priority during the replication. |
| *rplMostRecentFirst* | The most recent data has priority. Caution, the most recent data is evaluated according to the time on the subscriber replica. |
| *rplSubscriberFirst* | The data found in the subscriber database has priority during the replication. |





**Caution: By default, the master has priority**: when performing a replication from subscriber to master, the master data will not be updated. We recommend that you use another constant (*rplMostRecentFirst* for example).

### Synchronization with custom conflict management (WLanguage procedure)

`<Result> = HSynchronizeReplica(<Master replica> , <Subscriber replica> , <Replication direction> [, <Filter procedure>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the operation was successful,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise.




**`<Master replica>: (Character string)`**

Location of the master replica. Depending on the replication type and direction, this parameter can correspond to:

- the path of replication file (xxxx.RPM file) for the master database.

- the name of movable file created by [HCreateMovableReplica](../WDLang4/3044209.md).

- an empty string (""). The current data files are considered as being the master database. The file corresponding to the master replica (.RPM) is sought either in the replication directory specified in the analysis (RPL subdirectory of data files by default), or in the directory specified with [HChangeRplDir](../WDLang4/3044236.md).




In most cases, this path corresponds to the full path of a file located in a network directory or to the path of a movable replica (USB key, email attachment, file retrieved by FTP).
For more details, see remarks.

**`<Subscriber replica>: (Character string)`**

Location of the subscriber replica. Depending on the replication type and direction, this parameter can correspond to:

- the path of replication file (xxxx.RPL file) for the subscriber database.

- the name of the movable file created by [HCreateMovableReplica](../WDLang4/3044209.md)

- an empty string (""). The current data files are considered as being the subscriber database. The file corresponding to the subscriber replica (.RPL)  is sought either in the replication directory specified in the analysis (RPL subdirectory of data files by default), or in the directory specified by [HChangeRplDir](../WDLang4/3044236.md).




In most cases, this path corresponds to the full path of a file located in a network directory or to the path of a movable replica (USB key, email attachment, file retrieved by FTP).
For more details, see [the remarks](#NOTE0_1).

**`<Replication direction>: (Integer constant)`**

Direction in which the replication will be performed:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *rplBidirectional* | Update the master database AND the subscriber database.<br><br>**Universal replication**: the bidirectional replication is not available. |
| *rplToMaster* | Update the master database according to the subscriber database.<br><br>&lt;Master replica&gt; corresponds to the movable replica created from the master database, &lt;Subscriber replica&gt; corresponds to the subscriber replica |
| *rplToSubscriber* | Update the subscriber database according to the master database.<br><br>&lt;Master replica&gt; corresponds to the master replica, &lt;Subscriber replica&gt; corresponds to the movable replica created from the subscriber database. |



**`<Filter procedure>: (Optional procedure name)`**

Name of a WLanguage procedure found in the WINDEV or WEBDEV project (this name must be enclosed in quotes). This procedure must be created in your application. This procedure expects no parameter. 
This procedure is called before each operation performed on the destination file. Several variables can be used in this procedure. 
If this procedure returns <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>, the operation is not performed. This procedure is used to:

- filter the records that must not be replicated.

- manage the conflicts, by adjusting the values before a duplicate error occurs.




For more details, see the example of **HSynchronizeReplica**.

### Which data files can be replicated? 
<a name="which_data_files_can_replicated_ELTPARAGRAPHE000270"></a>

The synchronization can be performed:

- between two databases linked by network.

- between a database and a movable replica (created by [HCreateMovableReplica](../WDLang4/3044209.md)).




No replication can be performed toward a movable replica. You must create a movable replica with the database and replicate from the remote database.

**Caution**: **If you perform an automatic update of your data files**, all the replicas must be synchronized before this operation. Otherwise, all the modifications performed since the last synchronization and the automatic modification will be lost.
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Synchronization parameters
<a name="synchronization_parameters_ELTPARAGRAPHE000287"></a>

The table below presents the different combinations of parameters that must be used according to the replication type and direction:

| Replication direction | &lt;Master replica&gt; | &lt;Subscriber replica&gt; | &lt;Replication direction&gt; |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Replication from master to subscriber**<br>This replication is performed on the subscriber computer | Name of movable replica (\*.RPA) created from the master, with its eventual path | Name of subscriber replica (\*.RPL), with its eventual path. | *rplToSubscriber* |
| **Replication from subscriber to master**<br>This replication is performed on the master computer | Name of master replica (\*.RPM), with its eventual path. | Name of movable replica (\*.RPA) created from the subscriber, with its eventual path. | *rplToMaster* |

### Locking records during the log-based replication
<a name="locking_records_during_the_logbased_replication_ELTPARAGRAPHE000325"></a>

During the replication, the JournalOpération.Fic file is locked: you cannot write, modify or save records in the files with logs in the destination database.
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![User code (UMC)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/MCU.png)![HFSQL Classic](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HF.png)![Hyper File 5.5](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HF55.png) 

### Duplicate errors and/or integrity errors
<a name="duplicate_errors_andor_integrity_errors_ELTPARAGRAPHE000334"></a>

If a duplicate error or an integrity error occurs, the [standard mechanism for automatic management of errors](../WDLang4/3044188.md) is triggered. If the HFSQL engine returns an error, the replication is interrupted: only part of the data is replicated.

Universal replication: If an integrity error occurs during the replication, the replication continues but the function returns <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>.

To get the details of errors, you must read the HFSQL sub-errors with [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) (with the *hSubErrFirst* and *hSubErrNext* constants) then call [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md).

### Variables automatically initialized in the WLanguage procedure
<a name="variables_automatically_initialized_the_wlanguage_procedure_ELTPARAGRAPHE000360"></a>

| Variable | Type | Description and value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RPL.File | Character string | Name of the file whose data will be replicated |
| RPL.Operation | Integer constant | HFSQL operation that will be replicated:<br><br>- **rplHAdd**: replicate an addition<br><br>- **rplHModify**: replicate a modification<br><br>- **rplHDelete**: replicate a deletion<br><br><br> |
| RPL.Conflict | Integer constant | Indicates whether a conflict was detected during the replication. The possible values are as follows:<br><br>- **rplNoConflict**: no conflict was detected<br><br>- **rplModifyConflict**: The record was modified both in the source replica and in the destination replica<br><br>- **rplDeleteConflict**: The record was deleted from the destination replica and it was modified or deleted in the source replica.<br><br><br>To force the replication if a conflict occurred, RPL.Conflict must be initialized with the *rplNoConflict* variable.<br><br>Otherwise, the replication will be performed only if the conflict is a modification conflict and if the data to replicate comes from the master database. |
| RPL.Direction | Integer constant | Indicates the direction of replication (useful for a bidirectional replication):<br><br>- **rplToSubscriber**: replication from master to subscriber<br><br>- **rplToMaster**: replication from subscriber to master<br><br><br> |
| RPL.OperationNum | Integer | Number of the current operation. This value is included between 1 and RPL.OperationMax. This variable allows you to easily manage a progress bar. |
| RPL.OperationMax | Integer | Total number of operations to replicate. This variable allows you to easily manage a progress bar. |
| RPL.SourceAlias | Character string | Name of the source alias for the replicated file (RPL.File). This file contains the values of items that will be copied ([HAdd](../WDLang4/3044147.md)) or added ([HModify](../WDLang4/3044042.md)) into the file currently replicated. |
| RPL.TargetAlias | Character string | Name of target alias of replicated file (RPL.File). This file contains the values of the items before performing the copy or the deletion in the file currently replicated. |

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![User code (UMC)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/MCU.png)![HFSQL Classic](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HF.png)![Hyper File 5.5](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HF55.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) 

### Example: Replicating the data even if a conflict occurred (using a WLanguage procedure): 
<a name="example_replicating_the_data_even_conflict_occurred_using_wlanguage_procedure_ELTPARAGRAPHE000444"></a>

This example is used to force the replication of data even if a modification conflict occurs. To do so, force the value of the **RPL.Conflict** variable with the *rplNoConflict* constant.


```wl
IF RPL.Conflict = rplModifyConflict THEN
	RPL.Conflict = rplNoConflict
	RETURN True
END
```



### Replication and WithSpace function
<a name="replication_and_withspace_function_ELTPARAGRAPHE000656"></a>

The replication is not compatible with [WithSpace](../WDLang4/3044142.md) in the code of the client application. This function changes the nehavior of HFSQL. Using this function in the client application can affect the efficiency of replication.

From version 21 update 3 (version 210065), the synchronization functions (programmed or assisted universal replication) return an error to the client application if [WithSpace](../WDLang4/3044142.md) was applied to at least one of the replicated files. 


### Lifespan of movable replica
<a name="lifespan_movable_replica_ELTPARAGRAPHE000454"></a>

The replica is destroyed at the end of the replication in case of success. Replaying the replica will cause errors (for example, an addition causes a duplicate error). The replica uses the .syn file that is destroyed as well (another .syn file replaces it with the useless cleared information). 

A "movable" replica is moved (copied) between the master and the subscriber or between the subscriber and the master. To store an archive, all you have to do is store the source file (the one created by [HCreateMovableReplica](../WDLang4/3044209.md)). 




### Replication and filter
<a name="replication_and_filter_ELTPARAGRAPHE000465"></a>

When browsing the data to replicate, the replication takes into account the filters positioned by [HFilter](../WDLang4/3044100.md). 

Therefore, for a programmed universal replication without replication server, [HFilter](../WDLang4/3044100.md) can be used to limit the data to synchronize. 

On the contrary, for a replication performed via a replication server, all the filters must be disabled before performing the replication with **HSynchronizeReplica**. 

Remark: [HClose](../WDLang4/3044073.md) is used to delete all the filters defined by [HFilter](../WDLang4/3044100.md) on a data file.
