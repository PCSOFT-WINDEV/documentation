<a name="Use"></a>
<a name="description"></a>
Starts a transaction on the data files (HFSQL or accessed via a Native Connector) and creates the transaction file.

**What information is saved in the transaction file?** Whenever a WLanguage function modifies a data file or an index file during a transaction, the former values of the record and the operation performed are stored in the transaction file.

![HFSQL Client/Server](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HFCS.png) The transaction can be started on a connection: In this case, a transaction is started only for files associated to this connection. This mode is required to manage the [isolation levels of transactions](../WDLang4/1000017316.md). 

**Remark**: This function is equivalent to [&lt;Connection variable&gt;.Transaction](../WDLang4/1000023965.md).

## Example


```wl
MyConnection1 is Connection

// Start transaction on data files associated with MyConnection1
MyConnection1.TransactionStart()

// Code used to prepare the order to added
// ...

WHEN EXCEPTION IN
	// Add the order
	Order.Add() 
	// Validate the addition
	MyConnection1.TransactionEnd()
DO
	// Delete the order lines
	MyConnection1.TransactionCancel()
END
```

## Syntax

### Starting a Client/Server transaction on a specific connection

`<Result> = <Connection>.TransactionStart([<List of data files>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the transaction was started,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if a problem occurs. [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) returns more details about the error.




**`<Connection>: (Connection variable)`**

Name of the [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md) variable that describes the connection to use.

**`<List of data files>: (Optional character string)`**

List of logical names of one or more data files to take into account (or not) in the transaction (in this case, the data file name is preceded by the "-" sign).


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| **If this parameter is not specified** | All data files used during the transaction will be taken into account in the transaction. |
| **If all data files are prefixed with the "-" sign**<br>For example: "-Customer, -Product" | All data files specified in the list and used during the transaction will not be taken into account by the transaction.<br>All data files not specified in the list will be taken into account and used during the transaction. |
| **If no data file on the list is prefixed with the "-" sign**<br>For example: "Customer, Product" | All data files specified in the list and used during the transaction will be taken into account in the transaction. <br>All data files not specified and manipulated during the transaction will be ignored in the transaction. |
| **If some data files are prefixed with "-" and others are not**<br>For example: "-Customer, Product" (equivalent to "Product") | All data files in the list prefixed with "-" and used during the transaction will be ignored in the transaction.<br>All data files in the list not prefixed with "-" and used during the transaction will be taken into account in the transaction.<br>The files not specified in the list will be excluded from the transaction. |

![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) This parameter is ignored. All the data files associated with the connection are in transaction on the native server.

Name of the [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md) variable that describes the connection to use.

**`<Transaction file>: (Character string)`**

Full name of the transaction file (used to store the operations performed within the transaction). 

This parameter is not taken into account for connections to an HFSQL Server.  

**`<List of data files>: (Character string)`**

List of logical names of one or more data files to take into account (or not) in the transaction (in this case, the data file name is preceded by the "-" sign).

## Remarks
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Locking records
<a name="locking_records_ELTPARAGRAPHE000480"></a>

The added, modified or deleted records in a transaction are locked in write mode.
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Error cases
<a name="error_cases_ELTPARAGRAPHE000490"></a>

- Nesting transactions: Transactions cannot be nested (i.e. **&lt;Connection variable&gt;.TransactionStart** cannot be called in a transaction). In this case, error 70031 occurs.

- A fatal error is displayed in the following cases: 

	- A transaction is started on all the connections while there is at least one connection in transaction. 

	- A transaction is started on a connection while a transaction was already started on all the connections. 

	- A transaction is started on all the connections while there is at least one connection whose isolation mode is not "Read Uncommitted".

### Handling records during a transaction
<a name="handling_records_during_transaction_ELTPARAGRAPHE000525"></a>

During a transaction, some rules must be complied with when handling the records. For more details, see [Transactions: Handling records during a transaction](../WDLang4/3044336.md).
<a name="NOTE0_6"></a>


### Transactions and independent HFSQL context
<a name="transactions_and_independent_hfsql_context_ELTPARAGRAPHE000538"></a>

When copying a context, if a transaction is in progress on the first context, the new context is not in transaction. You must call **&lt;Connection variable&gt;.TransactionStart** to start a transaction in the new context.

### OLE DB and Native Connectors
<a name="ole_and_native_connectors_ELTPARAGRAPHE000552"></a>

Only the syntaxes with connection are taken into account by the Native Accesses that support the transactions. You can also use [SQLTransaction](../WDLang4/3072029.md).
