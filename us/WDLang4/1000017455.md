The **hBackupDescription** type is used to programmatically describe an HFSQL Client/Server backup. 
This backup can be performed immediately or it can be scheduled. 
The characteristics of this backup can be defined and changed using different [WLanguage properties](#NOTE0_1).

**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

## Example


```wl
// Describe an immediate backup
Backup_Doc is hBackupDescription
Backup_Doc.Description = "Doc Backup"
Backup_Doc.WithIndex = True

Backup_Doc.Destination = "Doc/Backup"
Backup_Doc.Source = "Doc/*"
Backup_Doc.ProcedureBefore = "mydatabase:DocCol.Check" 
Backup_Doc.ProcedureAfter = "mydatabase:DocCol.CheckBackup"
Backup_Doc.LimitNumberBackups = 5
// Save backup 
HBackup(MyConnection, Backup_Doc)
```
<a name="Example2"></a>

```wl
// Create a scheduled backup every 5 minutes 
// with a differential backup every minute

	" with a differential backup every minute on the database " + ...
	 cnt.Database + " created on "+ DateToString(DateSys(), maskDateSystem) + ...
	" at " + TimeToString(TimeSys(), "HH:MM:SS:CC")
hBck.Destination = "Backup_"+ cnt.Database
hBck.LimitNumberBackups = 2
hBck.Source = cnt.Database

### WLanguage properties that can be used with the hBackupDescription type
<a name="wlanguage_properties_that_can_used_with_the_hbackupdescription_type_ELTPARAGRAPHE000046"></a>

The following properties can be used to handle a **hBackupDescription** variable.

| Name | Type used | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Compression | Integer constant | Used to compress (or not) the result of backup. This property can correspond to one of the following constants:<br><br>- *zipFormatNone*: No compression.<br><br>- *zipFormatZIP*: Compression in Zip format.<br><br><br> |
| Description | Character string | Description associated with the backup. <br>This property is optional. <br>The backup description corresponds to an empty string ("") by default. |
| Destination | Character string | Destination of the backup (name and destination of the backup). <br>The backup will be preformed on the server, in a location defined by this name. <br>If this name corresponds to a relative path, the backup will be placed in the "Backup" subdirectory of the HFSQL server. <br>To specify:<br><br>- the directory of the Manta service, use the "%%EXE%%" character string.<br><br>- the year, use the "%%YEAR%%" character string (2008 for example).<br><br>- the month on 2 digits, use the "%%MONTH%%" character string (03 for example).<br><br>- the day, use the "%%DAY%%" character string.<br><br>- the hour, use the "%%HOUR%%" character string.<br><br>- the minutes, use the "%%MINUTE%%" character string.<br><br><br><br><br>Examples: <br><br>- To store the backup in a directory that corresponds to the year, day, and time in the "Backup" subdirectory, use: <br>	<br><pre><code>// Store backup in 2021_21_13 <br>	Backup_Doc.Destination="%%YEAR%%_%%DAY%%_%%HOUR%%"</code></pre><br><br><br>- To save the backup in a "Doc/Backup" directory at the same level as the Manta service directory, use: <br>	<br><pre><code>Backup_Doc.Destination="%%EXE%%/Doc/Backup/%%YEAR%%"</code></pre><br><br><br><br> |
| Enabled | Boolean | Used to manage the activation of a scheduled backup:  <br><br>- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the backup scheduling is enabled: the backup is performed according to the scheduling. <br><br>- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if the backup scheduling is not enabled: the backup is not performed.<br><br><br> |
| Identifier | Integer | Backup identifier. <br>**This property is read-only**. |
| LimitNumberBackups | Integer | Maximum number of backups of the same type to perform. There is no limit if this number corresponds to 0. <br>If the number of backups exceeds the limit value, some former backups will be removed from the server.<br>For more details, see ["Operating mode of the limit regarding the number of backups"](#NOTE0_2). |
| ProcedureAfter | Character string | Name of the stored procedure used after the execution of the backup.<br> The procedure name has the following format: &lt;Database name&gt;:&lt;Name of set of procedures&gt;.&lt;Name of stored procedure&gt;. <br><br>This property is optional. <br>No procedure is run if this property is not defined.<br><br>For more details, see ["Parameters of the stored procedure called AFTER the backup"](#Note0_4). |

| ProgressBar | Control name | Name of the Progress Bar control used in the window to view the progress of the initialization step of the backup (and not the progress of the backup). <br><br>Optional property available in WINDEV only. |
| SchedulingDifferential | [hScheduling](../WDLang4/1000018853.md) variable | Characteristics of a differential scheduling. You have the ability to define both a full scheduling and a differential scheduling. No differential scheduling can be performed on its own.<br>This property is optional. |
| SchedulingFull | [hScheduling](../WDLang4/1000018853.md) variable | Characteristics of a full scheduling. This property must necessarily be specified. |
| Source (\*) | Character string | Filter used to define the data to back up. The possible values are:<br><br>- \*: Makes a backup copy of all the databases of the server, the logs, the system databases (users, groups, rights).<br><br>- Database name/\*: Makes a back up copy of the entire database: files, links, stored procedures, triggers.<br><br>- Database name/Name of File1: Makes a back up copy of &lt;Name of File1&gt; found in &lt;Database name&gt;<br><br>- Name of database 1/Name of File1 + TAB + Name of database 2/Name of File2 + ...: List of elements to back up.

| User | Character string | User who has created the backup.<br>**This property is read-only**. |
| WebhookAfter | Character string | URL of a REST service that will be triggered after the backup and the procedure specified with the **ProcedureAfter** procedure (if it exists). <br><br>A POST request will be performed on the provided URL. The URL receives an "application/json" content corresponding to the information on the backup. For example: <br><pre><code>{<br>	"identifier": "283",<br>	"destination": "c:\backup\283\mybackup.zip",<br>	"state": "completed"<br>}</code></pre><br>where: <br><br>- "identifier" corresponds to the backup identifier. <br><br>- "destination" corresponds to the backup destination. <br><br>- "state" corresponds to the state of the backup. There are different states: 'completed', 'canceled' or 'error'.<br><br><br> |
| WithIndex | Boolean | <br><br>- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if indices must be backed up,<br><br>- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise.<br><br><br>This property is optional. <br>By default, the backup copy of the indexes is made. |





The properties followed by (\*) are mandatory.

### Limit on the number of backups (LimitNumberBackups property)
<a name="limit_the_number_backups_limitnumberbackups_property_ELTPARAGRAPHE000282"></a>

When the limit on the number of backups is defined (**LimitNumberBackups** different from 0):

1. Before the backup: Search for the former similar backups (same source and same destination). If these backups are in error, the files of the backup will be erased from the disk (but the backup will remain in the history of backups).

2. Running the "Before Procedure".

3. Backup.

4. Running the "After Procedure".

5. If the number of similar backups (same source and same destination) successfully performed is greater than the limit value, the server will delete some of these backups and will remove them from the history. This deletion starts from the oldest backup until the number of backups is equal to the requested value.




**Remark**: This property can be used to implement a specific backup system. For example:

- A daily backup while storing the last 7 backups.

- A weekly backup while storing the last 4 backups.

- A monthly backup while storing the last 6 backups.
