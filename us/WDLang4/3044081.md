## Syntax

`<Result> = HState([<Data file> [, <Record number>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer constant)`**

Status of record: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hStateActive* | The record is active. |
| *hStateCrossed* | The record is crossed. |
| *hStateDel* | The record is deleted. |
| *hStateInvalid* | Record status not found (error). |



**`<Data file>: (Optional character string)`**

Name of the data file used. If this name is not specified, **HState** will use the last data file used by the last HFSQL function (function starting with "H").

**`<Record number>: (Optional integer)`**

Number of the sought record. If this number is not specified (or is equal to 0), **HState** will handle the current record. The current record is not read again.

## Remarks


### Record number not specified
<a name="record_number_not_specified_ELTPARAGRAPHE000113"></a>

**HState** reads no record if &lt;Record number&gt; is not specified.

In a network application, we advise you to read the record again before the call to **HState** to make sure that the record was not deleted. With [HRead](../WDLang4/3044047.md) for example:

```wl
HRead(FileName, hRecNumCurrent)
```

### Data files in Hyper File 5.5 format
<a name="data_files_hyper_file_55_format_ELTPARAGRAPHE000139"></a>

With the Hyper File 5 engine, the record must be read again in order for its status to be refreshed. Indeed, if the record is not read again after [HDelete](../WDLang4/3044018.md) or [HCross](../WDLang4/3044121.md), **HState** always returns *hStateActive*.

This operating mode is no longer available in the HFSQL Classic engine. Once [HDelete](../WDLang4/3044018.md) or [HCross](../WDLang4/3044121.md) was used on the current record, **HState** returns the current record status.

### xBase files
<a name="xbase_files_ELTPARAGRAPHE000168"></a>

[HDelete](../WDLang4/3044018.md) and [HCross](../WDLang4/3044121.md) have the same effect: the record is crossed but it is not deleted. Therefore, the record can be re-enabled using [HModify](../WDLang4/3044042.md). 

In this case, **HState** returns the *hStateCrossed* constant for a deleted record (instead of *hStateDel*).
