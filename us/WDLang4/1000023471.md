## Example


```wl
MyConnection is Connection

ConfigReplication1 is hRSConfig
ConfigReplication1.Server = "atlas.mycompany.com:4996"
Add(ConfigReplication1.File, "MyDatabase")
Add(ConfigReplication1.File, "-MyDatabase\MyFilefic")
MyConnection.RSAddConfig(ConfigReplication1, hrsNoCopy)
```

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = <Connection>.RSAddConfig(<Replication to perform> , <Option> [, <Progress Bar>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the replication was added,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) is used to identify the error.




**`<Connection>: (Connection variable)`**

Name of the [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md) variable that describes the connection to the master HFSQL server.

**`<Replication to perform>: (hRSConfig variable)`**

Name of [hRSConfig](../WDLang4/1000020484.md) variable describing the replication to perform.

**`<Option>: (Integer constant)`**

Action to perform: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hrsCopy* | Enables the initial copy of replicated elements from the connection server (master server) to the other server (subscriber server, defined in the [hRSConfig](../WDLang4/1000020484.md) variable). This copy is locking. <br><br>Compatibility with the earlier versions: Corresponds to <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> in the earlier versions. |
| *hrsCopyBackgroundTask* | Enables the initial copy of replicated elements from the connection server (master server) to the other server (subscriber server, defined in the [hRSConfig](../WDLang4/1000020484.md) variable). This copy is performed in background task and it is not locking. <br><br>To find out whether the copy was performed: <br><br>1. List the available replications with [&lt;Connection variable&gt;.RSListConfig](../WDLang4/1000023554.md). <br><br>2. If the desired replication does not appear in the list, it means that it was not added. <br><br>3. If the desired replication appears in the list, check the value of the **Initialization** property of the [hRSConfig](../WDLang4/1000020484.md) variable. If this property: <br><br>	- is included between 0 and 1000, the replication is currently added. <br><br>	- is set to 1000, the replication was added. <br><br>	- is not specified, the replication failed to be added.  <br><br><br><br><br><br> |
| *hrsNoCopy* | No copy is performed. <br><br>Compatibility with the earlier versions: Corresponds to <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> in the earlier versions. |



**`<Progress Bar>: (Optional control name)`**

Name of the Progress Bar control used to see the progress of initial copy.
