Writes a record into a data file without updating the indexes corresponding to all keys used in the data file. The memos are added if necessary (if the management of memos is enabled, [&lt;Source&gt;.SetMemo](../WDLang4/1000024987.md)).

After the call to **&lt;Source&gt;.Write**:

- integrity and duplicate errors are not checked.

- if a lock problem occurs (attempt to modify a locked record), [HErrorLock](../WDLang4/3044099.md) returns <u><u><u>True</u></u></u> and the record is not modified.

- the number of the current record is modified: the current record corresponds to the record written.




**Remarks**:

- To update the indexes during a write operation, use [&lt;Source&gt;.Add](../WDLang4/1000024187.md) or [&lt;Source&gt;.Modify](../WDLang4/1000025038.md). 
	![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) **&lt;Source&gt;.Write** and [&lt;Source&gt;.Modify](../WDLang4/1000025038.md) are equivalent. The indexes on the database are updated.

- If a key value is modified with **&lt;Source&gt;.Write**, the index will no longer be consistent. It must be re-indexed ([&lt;Source&gt;.Index](../WDLang4/1000025060.md)).

- This function can be used to write a record into a selection performed by a query (query run with the *hWithFilter* constant).

## Example


```wl
// Write a record at the end of a data file
Customer.Write(HNbRec() + 1)
```

<a name="XSYNTAX"></a>
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

## Syntax

`<Result> = <Source>.Write([<Record number> [, <Options>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the writing was performed in the data file, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if an error occurred (lock, ...): the record is not modified. [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) is used to identify the error.




**`<Source>: (Type corresponding to the specified source)`**

Name of the data file used. 

**`<Record number>: (Optional integer)`**

Number of the record to write. The record loaded in memory is re-written on the specified record. 
If this number is greater than the total number of records in the data file, intermediate deleted records will be created in order for the sequential reading of the data file ([&lt;Source&gt;.Read](../WDLang4/1000025019.md)) to be consistent. 
If this parameter is not specified (equal to 0 or to the *hCurrentRecNum* constant), **&lt;Source&gt;.Write** modifies the current record in the data file.
![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) **&lt;Source&gt;.Write** modifies the current record only. You cannot specify a record number other than the current one (to specify the current record number, use the *hRecNumCurrent* constant).

**`<Options>: (Combination of optional constants)`**

Configures:

- **the mode for calculating the automatic identifier**: For more details on automatic identifiers for new records, see [Managing the automatic identifier during an addition](../WDLang4/3044183.md).
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hForceIDAuto* | The automatic identifier is not calculated during the write operation: The value of the identifier is the one stored during the write operation. |
| *hRecalculateIDAuto* | The automatic identifier of the record will be re-calculated during the write operation. This constant has priority over *hForceIDAuto* and *hSetIDAuto*. |
| *hSetIDAuto* | The automatic identifier is not calculated during the write operation: The value of the identifier is the one stored during the write operation. <br>The next value of the identifier calculated by the HFSQL engine will correspond to the greatest value of the identifier in the file +1. |
| *hWriteDefault*<br>(Default value) | **If the written record is not a deleted record**, the automatic identifier (if it exists) of the record in the data file is re-used. <br>**If the written record is a deleted record**, a new automatic identifier is calculated for the record.<br>The *hWriteDefault* constant is ignored if *hWriteDefault* is specified with one of the other constants. |


	A WLanguage error is generated if the three constants (*hForceIDAuto*, *hSetIDAuto* and *hRecalculateIDAuto*) are used at the same time.

- **the lock mode applied to the record.**
	If no lock constant is specified, the record is not locked.
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hLockNo* <br>(Default value) | No lock: the written record is not locked. |
| *hLockReadWrite* | Lock in read/write: the written record will be locked in read/write. This record cannot be read or modified by another application. Only the current application can modify it, read it or unlock it. |
| *hLockWrite* | Lock in write mode: the written record will be locked in write mode. This record can be read by another application but it cannot be modified by another application. Only the current application can modify it or unlock it. |





![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) Lock options will have no effect if the OLE DB provider or Native Connector (also called Native Access) does not support locks.
![Hyper File 5.5](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HF55.png) &lt;Options&gt; is ignored.

## Remarks


### Managing automatic identifiers
<a name="managing_automatic_identifiers_ELTPARAGRAPHE000390"></a>

By default, the "automatic identifier" item is automatically updated when a record is added into a data file.

The *hForceIDAuto* and *hSetIDAuto* constants are used to modify the default behavior of the automatic identifier.

For more details on automatic identifiers for new records, see [Managing the automatic identifier](../WDLang4/3044183.md).


![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) **Special cases**

- If the database generates an automatic identifier, the HFSQL engine keeps this value. If the *hForceIDAuto* or *hSetIDAuto* constant is specified, the HFSQL engine replaces the generated value by the desired value.
	**Remark**: the *hForceIDAuto* constant is equivalent to *hSetIDAuto*: the automatic identifier calculated by the HFSQL engine during the next addition will be unique in the data file.

- If no automatic identifier is generated by the database, the HFSQL engine generates the value and assigns it to the automatic identifier.

### Writing deleted or crossed records
<a name="writing_deleted_crossed_records_ELTPARAGRAPHE000419"></a>

If the record number corresponds to a crossed record or to a deleted record, this record is re-enabled.

### Version of the data file after a write operation
<a name="version_the_data_file_after_write_operation_ELTPARAGRAPHE000431"></a>

If the record was written (no lock problem, etc.), the data file version number is modified. To get the version number, use [&lt;Source&gt;.Version](../WDLang4/1000025082.md).
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Managing binary memos
<a name="managing_binary_memos_ELTPARAGRAPHE000446"></a>

When a record is modified, the memos are modified if necessary (if the management of memos is enabled by [&lt;Source&gt;.SetMemo](../WDLang4/1000024987.md)). 
**Reminder**: to initialize a binary memo item, use [&lt;Source&gt;.LinkMemo](../WDLang4/1000024194.md).

### If you use &lt;Source&gt;.Write with a Hyper File 5.5 database
<a name="you_use_docparampagetitleshort_with_hyper_file_55_database_ELTPARAGRAPHE000470"></a>

### Browsing and writing a record
<a name="browsing_and_writing_record_ELTPARAGRAPHE000484"></a>

If the write operation is performed during a browse, the record written will be visible in the current browse only. If other browse operations have been defined on this database, the record written will only be visible once these browse operations have been re-initialized.
