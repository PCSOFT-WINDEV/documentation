<a name="variables_for_managing_users_ELTTEXTE000380"></a>


### Which variables?
<a name="which_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000058"></a>

The following variables are used to manage users:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| HUser.ActiveDirectory | Boolean (False by default).<br><br>If this variable is set to True, the user is using an authentication via Active Directory. |
| HUser.AuthorizedIP | Character string<br><br>Set of elements representing the IP addresses allowed for the user. The different elements are separated by CR characters (Carriage Return).<br><br>This variable can correspond to:<br><br>- An IPv4 address (68.12.53.26 for example) or several IPv4 addresses separated by CR characters (Carriage Return).<br><br>- An IPv6 address (feco::40 for example) or several IPv6 addresses separated by CR characters (Carriage Return).<br><br>- A range of IPv4 addresses in CIDR format. For example: 68.12.0.0/16<br><br>- A range of IPv6 addresses in CIDR format. For example: fec0:56::0/32<br><br>- A DNS FQDN name (myserver.pcsoft.com for example) or several DNS names separated by CR characters (Carriage Return).<br><br>- A sub-domain name (.pcsoft.com for example: pay attention to the dot) or several sub-domain names separated by CR characters (Carriage Return).<br><br><br> |
| HUser.CreationInfo | Read-only character string.<br><br>Name of person who created the user account and creation date.<br><br>These details are separated by a tabulation (TAB). The creation date corresponds to an 8-digit character string. |
| HUser.Description | Character string. <br><br>User description. |
| HUser.Email | Character string. <br><br>Email address of user. |
| HUser.EnabledAccount | Boolean (True by default).<br><br>If this variable is set to False, the account exists but it is not enabled. Used for example to disable a user account during a given period. |
| HUser.ExpirationDate | Read-only date.<br><br>Password expiration date. This date is deduced from the validity period of password and from the date of its last modification. |
| HUser.FullName | Character string. <br><br>Full name of user (up to 50 characters). |
| HUser.Groups | Character string.<br><br>Name of groups to which the user is associated. The different groups are separated by CR characters (Carriage Return). |
| HUser.Login | Character string<br><br>User login (up to 50 characters).<br><br>The user login is not case sensitive. |
| HUser.Password | Read-only character string.<br><br>User password. This password is sensitive to the case and to the accented characters. |
| HUser.Phone | Character string. <br><br>User's phone number. |
| HUser.Photo | Binary string corresponding to the photo of user.<br><br>We recommend that you use dSaveImagexxx to assign an image to this variable. |
| HUser.SuperUser | Boolean (False by default)<br><br>If this variable is set to True:<br><br>- The rights granted to this user are not checked. Therefore, all the actions can be performed by this user.<br><br>- The password of this user never expires.<br><br><br> |
| HUser.ValidityPeriod | Integer (0 by default, no validity period).<br><br>Validity period of password (in days). This validity period is taken into account from the date of last password modification. |
