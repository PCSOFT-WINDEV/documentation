<a name="description"></a>
Adds or modifies a server trigger on the HFSQL server. To perform these operations: 

- The trigger must have been previously described in the analysis.

- The stored procedure released by the trigger must exist on the server. This procedure can be updated by [HUpdateSet](../WDLang4/3044354.md).




**This function is used to update the HFSQL server without having to perform an automatic data update.**

**Reminder**: The server triggers are stored procedures run by the server before or after a write operation performed on a database file. For more details, see [Server triggers](../WDLang4/3044369.md).
