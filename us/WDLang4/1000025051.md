<a name="description"></a>
Crosses a record in a data file. The record is deleted logically and it can be retrieved if necessary.

The following operations are performed:

- the record becomes inactive. The data is stored (which is not the case when a record is deleted by [&lt;Source&gt;.Delete](../WDLang4/1000025071.md)).

- the indexes (corresponding to the record keys) are deleted from the index file.

- the memos associated with the record are stored.




This function can be used on the data files, the HFSQL Mobile views or the queries.

## Example

<a name="Example1"></a>

```wl
// Crosses the record #123
Customer.Cross(123)
```
<a name="Example2"></a>

```wl
// Cross the customer orders
Order.ReadSeekFirst(CUSTNUM, ValCustNum)
WHILE Order.Found() = True
	Order.Cross()
	Order.ReadNext()
END
```

## Syntax

`<Result> = <Source>.Crossed([<Record number> [, <Options>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the record was crossed,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if an error occurred (locked record, integrity error, ...). [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) returns more details.




**`<Source>: (Type corresponding to the specified source)`**

Name of HFSQL data file, query or view used. 

**`<Record number>: (Optional integer)`**

Number of the record to cross. 
If this parameter is not specified (equal to 0 or to the *hCurrentRecNum* constant), the current record will be crossed.

**`<Options>: (Optional constant)`**

Configures:

- the lock mode applied to the crossed record. If no lock constant is specified, the crossed record is not locked.
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hLockNo*<br>(default value) | No lock: the crossed record will not be locked. |
| *hLockReadWrite* | Lock in read/write: the current crossed record cannot be read or re-enabled by another application. |
| *hLockWrite* | Lock in write mode: another application can read and consult the current crossed record ([&lt;Source&gt;.Read](../WDLang4/1000025019.md)) but cannot re-enable it. Only the current application can re-enable it. |



- the integrity management applied to the crossed record.
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hCheckIntegrity* | Checks the integrity for the operation, even if the automatic integrity check is disabled ([&lt;Connection variable&gt;.SetIntegrity](../WDLang4/1000023960.md)). |
| *hIgnoreIntegrity* | Ignores the integrity check for this operation, even if the automatic integrity check is enabled ([&lt;Connection variable&gt;.SetIntegrity](../WDLang4/1000023960.md)). |


	A WLanguage error occurs if the two constants are used at the same time. These constants have no effect on the cascading deletion.

## Remarks


### Handling a crossed record
<a name="handling_crossed_record_ELTPARAGRAPHE000330"></a>

- A crossed record will not be read:

	- by iteration functions: [&lt;Source&gt;.First](../WDLang4/1000025048.md), [&lt;Source&gt;.Last](../WDLang4/1000024217.md), [&lt;Source&gt;.Next](../WDLang4/1000025070.md), [&lt;Source&gt;.Previous](../WDLang4/1000025047.md), [&lt;Source&gt;.ReadFirst](../WDLang4/1000025022.md), [&lt;Source&gt;.ReadLast](../WDLang4/1000025020.md), [&lt;Source&gt;.ReadNext](../WDLang4/1000025035.md), [&lt;Source&gt;.ReadPrevious](../WDLang4/1000025021.md), [&lt;Source&gt;.Forward](../WDLang4/1000024195.md), [&lt;Source&gt;.Backward](../WDLang4/1000025056.md)

	- by the search functions: [&lt;Source&gt;.SeekFirst](../WDLang4/1000025055.md), [&lt;Source&gt;.ReadSeekFirst](../WDLang4/1000025034.md), [&lt;Source&gt;.SeekLast](../WDLang4/1000025054.md), [&lt;Source&gt;.ReadSeekLast](../WDLang4/1000025024.md).




- A crossed record can be read by [&lt;Source&gt;.Read](../WDLang4/1000025019.md).

- A crossed record can be re-enabled by [&lt;Source&gt;.Modify](../WDLang4/1000025038.md) or [&lt;Source&gt;.Write](../WDLang4/1000024331.md).

- [&lt;Source&gt;.State](../WDLang4/1000024943.md) is used to find out the record status (active, crossed, deleted, etc.).

- The physical location of a crossed record can only be reused (by [&lt;Source&gt;.Add](../WDLang4/1000024187.md) for example) after:

	- the execution of [&lt;Source&gt;.Free](../WDLang4/1000025010.md),

	- a reindex operation (with compression).






<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Number of crossed records
<a name="number_crossed_records_ELTPARAGRAPHE000448"></a>

[&lt;Source&gt;.NbRec](../WDLang4/1000025040.md) is used to find out the number of crossed records in the data file.

Remark: For backward compatibility with WEBDEV 1.5/WINDEV 5.5, the number of crossed records can also be returned by the *H.NbDel* variable.
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Version of data file
<a name="version_data_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000464"></a>

If **&lt;Source&gt;.Cross** is successful, the data file version number is modified. This version number is returned by [&lt;Source&gt;.Version](../WDLang4/1000025082.md).
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Crossing a record from a query
<a name="crossing_record_from_query_ELTPARAGRAPHE000481"></a>

A record can be crossed:

- in the query result.

- in the files handled by the query (*hModifyFile* constant used in [&lt;Source&gt;.ExecuteQuery](../WDLang4/1000024944.md) or [&lt;Source&gt;.ExecuteSQLQuery](../WDLang4/1000024948.md)). In this case, the *hWithFilter* constant is automatically selected.




Regardless of the query execution mode (with or without the *hWithFilter* constant), **&lt;Source&gt;.Cross** can only be used on single-file queries.

Caution: 

- Records cannot be crossed in a query that uses groups or aggregates.

- The management of integrity and duplicates is not performed during the operations on the multi-file queries: it is recommended to use transactions to avoid any problems.



<a name="NOTE0_5"></a>


### Special cases
<a name="special_cases_ELTPARAGRAPHE000513"></a>

- **Managing locks**: 
	If a lock problem occurs when "crossing" a record (attempt to cross a record locked in write mode for example), the record is not modified and [HErrorLock](../WDLang4/3044099.md) returns <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>.

- **Managing the referential integrity**
	If the management of the referential integrity is enabled ([&lt;Connection variable&gt;.SetIntegrity](../WDLang4/1000023960.md)) and if the integrity is not checked during the deletion, **&lt;Source&gt;.Cross** is not run. [HErrorIntegrity](../WDLang4/3044086.md) must be checked after **&lt;Source&gt;.Cross**.

- **Deleted records**
	**&lt;Source&gt;.Cross** must not be called on a record that was deleted beforehand.

### xBase files
<a name="xbase_files_ELTPARAGRAPHE000554"></a>

[&lt;Source&gt;.Delete](../WDLang4/1000025071.md) and **&lt;Source&gt;.Cross** have the same effect: the record is crossed but it is not deleted. Therefore, the record can be re-enabled using [&lt;Source&gt;.Modify](../WDLang4/1000025038.md). In this case, [&lt;Source&gt;.State](../WDLang4/1000024943.md) returns the *hStateCrossed* constant for a deleted record (instead of *hStateDel*).
