**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u>True</u></u></u> if the data file was regenerated,

**`<Password>: (Optional character string (with quotes))`**



- Password of the log file (identical to the password defined for the data file). This password is mandatory to specify a destination directory.

**`<Destination directory>: (Optional character string (with quotes))`**

Date and time (in YYYYMMDDHHmmSSCCC format: YYYY: year, MM: month, DD: day, HH: hour, mm: minutes, SS: seconds, CCC: hundredths of a second) from which the operations in the log file will be replayed on the backup file.
