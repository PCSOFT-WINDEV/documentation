Configures an HFSQL server in order for this server to be a master server or a subscriber server for a replication between HFSQL servers.

## Example


```wl
HRSInit(Cnt, hrsSubscriber, 1, "pwd", 4996, 5)
```

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = HRSInit(<Connection> , <Server role> , <Server identifier> , <Password> , <Port> , <Priority>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the configuration was performed, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) is used to identify the error.




**`<Connection>: (Character string or Connection variable)`**

Connection to the HFSQL server to configure. This connection corresponds to: 

- the name of the connection defined in the data model editor or with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

- the name of a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md).




**`<Server role>: (Integer constant)`**

Role of server in the replication: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hrsInactive* | Inactive computer in the replication between HFSQL servers. |
| *hrsMaster* | Master computer in the replication between HFSQL servers. |
| *hrsMaster* + *hrsSubscriber* | Master and subscriber computers in the replication between HFSQL servers (for a bi-directional replication). |
| *hrsSubscriber* | Subscriber computer in the replication between HFSQL servers. |



**`<Server identifier>: (Integer)`**

Number used to identify the current HFSQL server among all the servers involved in a replication. This identifier must be unique. This identifier must be included between 1 and 32000. 

**`<Password>: (Character string)`**

Replication password, used to authenticate the servers between themselves. This password must be used on the other server in the call to [HRSAddConfig](../WDLang4/1000020492.md) (i.e. in the **Password** property of the [hrsConfig](../WDLang4/1000020484.md) variable).

To use the bidirectional replication, the password must be the same on the two servers.

**`<Port>: (Integer)`**

TCP/IP port number used for the replication between HFSQL servers. 

**`<Priority>: (Integer)`**

Priority number of server. During a modification conflict, this number is used if the method for solving the conflict corresponds to a resolution by priority.

## Remarks
**HRSInit** can be used several times on the same server, to change the role of a server in a replication, for example.
