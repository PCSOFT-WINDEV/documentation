Closes a data file or all the data files opened by the current user: all the corresponding physical data files are closed for the current user. For the HFSQL data files, the following files are closed:

- the data file (.FIC),

- the index file (.NDX) if it exists,

- the memo file (.MMO) if it exists.

- the full-text index file (.FTX) if it exists.




**When closing the data file**: 

- The locks (on the data file and/or some of its records) are unlocked.

- The filters defined on the data file with [&lt;Source&gt;.Filter](../WDLang4/1000024960.md) are automatically deleted. 

- The current iterations on the data file are canceled. 

- The current searches on the data file are canceled. 




Once the data file is closed, the reassignments performed by [&lt;Source&gt;.ChangeName](../WDLang4/1000024201.md), [&lt;Source&gt;.ChangeDir](../WDLang4/1000024202.md) and [HSubstDir](../WDLang4/3044028.md) are kept.

If a query was executed on the data file, [&lt;Source&gt;.CancelDeclaration](../WDLang4/1000024192.md) must be called on the query in order for the closing to be effective.

## Remarks


### Closing the tables and the connection
<a name="closing_the_tables_and_the_connection_ELTPARAGRAPHE000270"></a>

When all the tables that use the same connection (tables opened on the same database with the same connection parameters) are closed, the connection is automatically closed.

To close a connection, use [&lt;Connection variable&gt;.CloseConnection](../WDLang4/1000023941.md).
