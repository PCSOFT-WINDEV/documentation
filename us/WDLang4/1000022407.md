Starts tracking write actions (addition, modification or deletion) performed on a file found in an HFSQL server. In case of modification, a specific procedure can be triggered. 

This track can be stopped by [HTrackStop](../WDLang4/1000022430.md).

## Example


```wl
// Starts tracking the Order data file
// The ProcessOrder procedure is called whenever a record is added to the data file
HTrack(Order, ProcessOrder, hRecNumAll, hsAdd)
```

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = HTrack(<Data file> , <WLanguage procedure> [, <Record number> [, <Action to track> [, <Execution mode>]]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the tracking is enabled, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md).




**`<Data file>: (Optional character string)`**

Name of HFSQL data file to use. The data file is associated with a connection and with a server. 
If this parameter is an empty string (""), **HTrack** manipulates the last data file used by the last HFSQL function (function starting with "H").

**`<WLanguage procedure>: (Procedure name)`**

Name of the WLanguage procedure ("callback") called when a change is made in the specified data file. 
For more details on this procedure, see [Parameters of the procedure used by HTrack](../WDLang4/1000024804.md).

**`<Record number>: (Optional integer)`**



- Number of the record to track. 

- *hRecNumAll* constant to track all the records found in the data file (which means the entire data file). 




**`<Action to track>: (Optional constant (or combination of constants))`**

Actions to track for which the procedure will be started:  


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hsAdd* | Monitors the operations for adding records. |
| *hsCross* | Monitors the operations for crossing records. |
| *hsDeletion* | Monitors the operations for deleting records. |
| *hsModification* | Monitors the operations for modifying records. |



**`<Execution mode>: (Optional constant)`**

WLanguage procedure execution mode:  



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hSecondaryThread* | Execute the WLanguage procedure in a secondary thread. |


By default, the WLanguage procedure is executed in the main thread.

## Remarks


### WLanguage procedure executed in the main thread
<a name="wlanguage_procedure_executed_the_main_thread_ELTPARAGRAPHE000141"></a>

By default, this WLanguage procedure is called in the main thread of the application, with the HFSQL context that corresponds to the procedure:

- If the procedure is a local procedure of a window that uses an independent context, the context of the window will be used. 

- If the procedure belongs to a component that uses an independent context, the context of the component will be used.

| --- |
| **Caution**:<br>The procedure associated with **HTrack** can be called at any time in the application.<br>If the procedure reads records or moves between records in the data files, this will have an impact on the application (like the timers).<br>It may therefore be necessary to use: <br><br>- [HSavePosition](../WDLang4/3044136.md) and [HRestorePosition](../WDLang4/3044137.md) to save the contexts of the files used.<br><br>- a variable of type [Alias](../WDLang4/1000021446.md) to perform operations on alias files. <br><br><br>[Multitask](../WDLang1/3015004.md) must not be used in the procedure code. |


For more details on this procedure, see [Parameters of the procedure used by HTrack](../WDLang4/1000024804.md).


### WLanguage procedure executed in a secondary thread
<a name="wlanguage_procedure_executed_secondary_thread_ELTPARAGRAPHE000188"></a>

If the WLanguage procedure is called in a secondary thread: 

- the HFSQL context is copied the first time **HTrack** is called. Only the directories containing the data files in HFSQL Classic mode and/or the connections in HFSQL Client/Server mode are stored.

- UI elements (windows, controls, etc.) cannot be manipulated in the secondary thread. When a secondary thread must interact with the user or update the UI, it must use a process started from the main thread. This process can correspond to:

	- a global procedure of the project or a local procedure (of a window, etc.) called by [ExecuteMainThread](../WDLang1/1000019862.md),

	- the event "Request for refreshing the display" of a window run by [RequestRefreshUI](../WDLang1/1000023899.md).







For more details on this procedure, see [Parameters of the procedure used by HTrack](../WDLang4/1000024804.md).

### Special cases
<a name="special_cases_ELTPARAGRAPHE000217"></a>

The track is defined for a data file and a connection: 

- If the physical name or the connection associated with the logical file name changes, the file tracked by the server remains the one specified during the call to **HTrack**. 

- If the connection is closed, the track is automatically stopped.

- The tracking continues if the connection is lost then restored by [automatic reconnection](../WDLang4/3044188.md).




To stop tracking the data file, use [HTrackStop](../WDLang4/1000022430.md). 
**HTrack** and [HTrackStop](../WDLang4/1000022430.md) can be used in a Windows service.
