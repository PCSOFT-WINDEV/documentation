Opens a data file.

**Remark**: The opening of data files is managed automatically. However, in some cases, you may have to explicitly open a data file (to check the file existence or the password validity for example).


<a name="Example1"></a>
<a name="sample_code"></a>

## Example


```wl
// Open Customer data file
HOpen(Customer)
```
<a name="Example2"></a>

```wl
// Open all data files with the password "PSW".
HOpen("*", "PSW")
```
<a name="Example3"></a>

```wl
// Check status report of HOpen
IF HOpen(Customer, "ABCD", hORead) = False THEN
	Error("Unable to open the Customer data file" + HErrorInfo())
END
```

## Syntax

`<Result> = HOpen([<Data file> [, <Password>] [, <Access mode>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the data file was opened.

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if a problem occurred (wrong password, ...). [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) is used to identify the error. [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) returns more details.




**`<Data file>: (Optional character string)`**

Name of data file used (logical name, defined in the analysis). 
If this name is not specified, **HOpen** will use the last data file used by the last HFSQL function (function starting with "H").
If this parameter is corresponds to "\*", all the data files described in the analysis are opened. If the password is specified, this password will be used to open all the data files. 
This parameter can also correspond to the name of a [group of files (or custom-folder) defined in the analysis](../Editeurs/2011003.md) (not available in Android and Android widget). If the password is specified, this password will be used to open all the data files of the group. 
Caution: this parameter cannot be a variable of type [File description](../WDLang4/1514065.md).

**`<Password>: (Optional character string)`**

Password of the data file. 
If no password is associated with the data file, you have the ability to use an empty string ("").

**`<Access mode>: (Optional integer constant)`**

Configures the access mode to the data file. 
If this parameter is not specified, the data file will be opened according to its characteristics (if the data file is read-only, it will be opened in read-only ; if the data file is read/write, it will be opened in read/write mode).


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hORead* | The data file can be accessed in read-only. You can only read records. No record can be added or deleted. |
| *hOReadWrite* | The data file can be accessed in read/write. You can read and write new records. |


![Hyper File 5.5](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HF55.png) This parameter is ignored.

## Remarks


### Managing the password
<a name="managing_the_password_ELTPARAGRAPHE000158"></a>

The password can be specified:

- when the data file is opened with **HOpen**,

- before the data file is opened with [HPass](../WDLang4/3044108.md).



<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Creating or opening a data file
<a name="creating_opening_data_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000175"></a>

[HCreationIfNotFound](../WDLang4/3044254.md) can replace **HOpen**. Indeed, if the data file exists, it is automatically opened.
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Opening a data file that is already opened
<a name="opening_data_file_that_already_opened_ELTPARAGRAPHE000188"></a>

If **HOpen** is used on a data file already opened with a different &lt;Access mode&gt;, the filters, locks and characteristics of the current iteration are lost.
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Managing the list of data files used (.REP)
<a name="managing_the_list_data_files_used_rep_ELTPARAGRAPHE000199"></a>

WINDEV Mobile allows you to update a list of data files used by the application (equivalent to the.REP file in WINDEV).

**HOpen** specifies the list of data files used by the application (.REP for WINDEV and WEBDEV) if updates are enabled for this list.

For more details, see [List of data files handled by an application](../WDLang4/3044045.md).
<a name="NOTE0_5"></a>


### Managing fatal errors
<a name="managing_fatal_errors_ELTPARAGRAPHE000217"></a>If a fatal error occurs when opening a data file, it may be interesting to continue the program while processing the error. To do so, we recommend that you perform the following exception process:

```wl
WHEN EXCEPTION IN
	HOpen(PARENT)
DO
	Error("HFSQL error: " + HError())
ELSE
	Trace("File opened")
END
```

### Opening a connection and the specified table
<a name="opening_connection_and_the_specified_table_ELTPARAGRAPHE000237"></a>

If necessary, **HOpen** opens the connection to the database before opening the specified table. If the connection is already open (with the same parameters), this connection is automatically used.

Remark: The connection used by default corresponds to the connection associated with the table in the data model editor.
