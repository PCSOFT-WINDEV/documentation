<a name="description"></a>
Positions on the first record of a data file whose value for a specific item is strictly equal to a sought value (exact-match search). The record is read and the corresponding HFSQL variables are updated.

In most cases, **&lt;Source&gt;.ReadSeekFirst** sets the position in the data file to loop through the records that match a condition. [&lt;Source&gt;.ReadNext](../WDLang4/1000025035.md) is used to read the next record corresponding to the condition.

Several cases may occur after the call to **&lt;Source&gt;.ReadSeekFirst**:

- ***a record corresponding to the condition was found***, locked (if necessary) and loaded in memory: [&lt;Source&gt;.Found](../WDLang4/1000025076.md) returns <u><u><u>True</u></u></u>.

- if no record corresponding to the condition exists ***but if a record with a greater value is found***: the record is read, [&lt;Source&gt;.Out](../WDLang4/1000024605.md) returns <u><u><u>False</u></u></u> and [&lt;Source&gt;.Found](../WDLang4/1000025076.md) returns <u><u><u>False</u></u></u>.

- ***the data file is empty***: no read operation is performed, [&lt;Source&gt;.Out](../WDLang4/1000024605.md) returns <u><u><u>True</u></u></u> and [&lt;Source&gt;.Found](../WDLang4/1000025076.md) returns <u><u><u>False</u></u></u>.

- the function tries to lock a record that is already locked in read-only: no read operation is performed, [HErrorLock](../WDLang4/3044099.md) returns <u><u><u>True</u></u></u> and [&lt;Source&gt;.Out](../WDLang4/1000024605.md) returns <u><u><u>True</u></u></u>.
	Remark: An [automatic management of lock errors and modification conflicts](../WDLang4/3044188.md) is performed by default (except in the code of stored procedures). This assisted management of errors can be customized or disabled at any time by [&lt;Source&gt;.OnError](../WDLang4/1000025073.md). 




**&lt;Source&gt;.ReadSeekFirst** can be used with the data files, HFSQL views or queries.

**Remark**: the search can be canceled by [&lt;Source&gt;.CancelSeek](../WDLang4/1000024193.md).
![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) **Special case**: management of locks:

- ![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) **In Java**, during an access by JDBC, the management of locks is not available for the databases accessed by JDBC.

## Syntax

`<Result> = <Source>.ReadSeekFirst(<Item> , <Sought value> [, <Options>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the record was found (corresponds to the value returned by [&lt;Source&gt;.Found](../WDLang4/1000025076.md)). 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if a problem occurs. This problem can be caused by:

	- a positioning problem (empty data file, etc.): [&lt;Source&gt;.Found](../WDLang4/1000025076.md) returns <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> and [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) returns 0.

	- an error: [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) returns an integer other than 0. [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) returns more details.







**`<Source>: (Type corresponding to the specified source)`**

Name of the HFSQL data file, view or query used.

**`<Item>: (Character string)`**

Name of item on which the search will be performed. This item can be a search key or not.
![Hyper File 5.5](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HF55.png) The search can only be performed on a key item.

**`<Sought value>: (Type corresponding to the value)`**

Value of the sought item.

**`<Options>: (Optional constant (or combination of constants))`**

Used to configure:

- the lock mode applied to the sought record

- the type of search performed.

## Remarks


### Generic search/Exact-match search
<a name="generic_searchexactmatch_search_ELTPARAGRAPHE000581"></a>

- **Generic search** (mainly on the Character String items): ***Finds all records starting with the specified value***. 
	For example: When a generic search is performed on "Smith" (for the NAME item), all records whose Name item starts with "Smith" will match the search. Therefore, the record that contains "Smither" will match the search ([&lt;Source&gt;.Found](../WDLang4/1000025076.md) returns <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>).
	Remark: For backward compatibility with WINDEV 5.5, the generic search of an empty string ("") is equivalent to the use of [&lt;Source&gt;.ReadFirst](../WDLang4/1000025022.md).

- **Exact-match search**: ***Finds all records that exactly correspond to the specified value***. 
	For example: When an exact-match search is performed on "Smith" (for the NAME item), [&lt;Source&gt;.Found](../WDLang4/1000025076.md) returns <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> for the records whose item exactly matches "Smith".

### Search performed on a key item or on a non-key item
<a name="search_performed_key_item_nonkey_item_ELTPARAGRAPHE000717"></a>

The search can be performed on a key item or a non-key item.

If the search is performed on a key item:

- the search is fast and the result is sorted.

- if the iteration operation is continued by [&lt;Source&gt;.ReadNext](../WDLang4/1000025035.md), the next records will correspond to the values greater than or equal to the search value. In this case, [&lt;Source&gt;.Out](../WDLang4/1000024605.md) must be checked after each read operation to find out whether the end of the data file has been reached.




If the search is performed on a non-key item:

- the selected item will appear in red in the code editor and a warning will appear in the ["Compilation errors" pane](../Editeurs/2027031.md).
	**Remark**: The [automatic completion](../Editeurs/2013001.md) proposes the key items only.

- if the iteration is continued by [&lt;Source&gt;.ReadNext](../WDLang4/1000025035.md), the next records will correspond to the values equal to the search value.



<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Performing a search on a composite key
<a name="performing_search_composite_key_ELTPARAGRAPHE000760"></a>

Several methods can be used to perform a search on a composite key:

- Using a list of values.

- Calling [&lt;Source&gt;.BuildKeyValue](../WDLang4/1000024205.md).




**1. Using a list of values**

The following syntax is used to perform a search on a composite key:


```txt
HReadSeekFirst(<File Name>, <Name of Composite Key>,
	[<Search value of first element of composite key>, 
		<Search value of first element of composite key>, ...])
```
Example:

```wl
// Find the record
Customer.ReadSeekFirst(LastName_FirstName, ["MOORE", "Vince"])
```

**2. Using [&lt;Source&gt;.BuildKeyValue](../WDLang4/1000024205.md)**

Example:

```wl
bufSoughtVal is Buffer = Customer.BuildKeyValue(LastName_FirstName, sLastName, sFirstName)
Customer.SeekFirst(LastName_FirstName, bufSoughtVal)
WHILE Customer.Found()
	Customer.Delete()
	Customer.Next(LastName_FirstName)
END
```


![Hyper File 5.5](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HF55.png) To perform generic searches on a composite key, all the components of composite key must be Text components. Otherwise, an exact-match search is performed.
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Search on an array item
<a name="search_array_item_ELTPARAGRAPHE000810"></a>

The search is performed on the first array element (element with index 1). To perform a search on the other array elements, use the filters or queries.
<a name="NOTE0_5"></a>


### Search and filter
<a name="search_and_filter_ELTPARAGRAPHE000820"></a>

If a filter is enabled ([&lt;Source&gt;.Filter](../WDLang4/1000024960.md)), the filter is taken into account by the search only if the key used is identical.

To apply this filter in the rest of the iteration (even if the search key is not optimized for the filter), use the *hKeepFilter* constant.
![Hyper File 5.5](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HF55.png) If a filter is enabled, the filter is ignored by the search.
<a name="NOTE0_6"></a>


### Looping through records that match a condition
<a name="looping_through_records_that_match_condition_ELTPARAGRAPHE000840"></a>

In most cases, **&lt;Source&gt;.ReadSeekFirst** sets the position in the data file to loop through the records that match a condition. [&lt;Source&gt;.ReadNext](../WDLang4/1000025035.md) and [&lt;Source&gt;.ReadPrevious](../WDLang4/1000025021.md) are used to read the next and previous matching records.

To ignore the search while going to the next or previous record, use one of the following functions:

- [&lt;Source&gt;.CancelSeek](../WDLang4/1000024193.md)

- [&lt;Source&gt;.ReadLast](../WDLang4/1000025020.md)

- [&lt;Source&gt;.ReadFirst](../WDLang4/1000025022.md)

### Exact-match search in Access
<a name="exactmatch_search_access_ELTPARAGRAPHE000879"></a>

To perform an exact-match search on an ACCESS database, it is recommended to use [NoSpace](../WDLang1/3024034.md) if there are space characters at the end of the sought value.
<a name="NOTE0_8"></a>
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png)![User code (UMC)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/MCU.png)![HFSQL Classic](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HF.png)![HFSQL Client/Server](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HFCS.png)![Hyper File 5.5](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HF55.png)![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) 

### Locks
<a name="locks_ELTPARAGRAPHE000894"></a>

The locks apply only when a record was found.

By default (no lock mode specified in &lt;Options&gt;), the record is not locked.

If a lock is requested (*hLockWrite* or *hLockReadWrite* constant), the record will be read only if this record is not already locked.

Reminder: A locked record can be unlocked by [&lt;Source&gt;.UnlockRecNum](../WDLang4/1000024212.md).

![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) Lock options will have no effect if the OLE DB provider or Native Connector (also called Native Access) does not support locks.
<a name="NOTE0_9"></a>
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png)![User code (UMC)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/MCU.png)![HFSQL Classic](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HF.png)![HFSQL Client/Server](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HFCS.png)![Hyper File 5.5](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HF55.png)![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) 

### Optimizing iterations
<a name="optimizing_iterations_ELTPARAGRAPHE000921"></a>

To optimize the first iterations on a data file, use [&lt;Source&gt;.Optimize](../WDLang4/1000025042.md) on this data file.
<a name="NOTE0_10"></a>
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![User code (UMC)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/MCU.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) 

### Native XML Connector
<a name="native_xml_connector_ELTPARAGRAPHE000938"></a>

The behavior of **&lt;Source&gt;.ReadSeekFirst** depends on [&lt;Source&gt;.ActivateAutoFilter](../WDLang4/1000024171.md) and [&lt;Source&gt;.DeactivateAutoFilter](../WDLang4/1000024219.md).

[&lt;Source&gt;.ActivateAutoFilter](../WDLang4/1000024171.md) is enabled by default.

Therefore, to read the content of XML file, read the content of main file (the parent) then read the content of linked files (the children).

By default, when reading a file, a filter is automatically applied to the linked files in order to only read the records corresponding to the main file.

For example:
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=XML_2.GIF)
The email of this person can be retrieved when looping through the Person file. 

To do so, simply set the position on the "Person" file and apply **&lt;Source&gt;.ReadSeekFirst** to the "Email" file.

In this case, the record read in the "Email" file will correspond to the first email associated with the current record in the "Person" file.

If this mechanism is disabled ([&lt;Source&gt;.DeactivateAutoFilter](../WDLang4/1000024219.md)), the record read in the "Email" file will correspond to the first record found in the Email file (and not to the child of the record read in the "Person" file).
