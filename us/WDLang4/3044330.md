## Syntax

`<Result> = HModifyFileProperty(<Connection> , <Property to modify> , <New value> , <Database> , <Data file>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the properties have been modified, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) is used to identify the error.




**`<Connection>: (Character string or Connection variable)`**

Connection for which the value of a property must be modified. This connection corresponds to: 

- the name of the connection defined in the data model editor or with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

- the name of a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md). 




**`<Property to modify>: (Integer constant)`**

Property of the data file that must be modified: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hNotes* | Description of the data file or any other information associated with the data file. <br>If this constant is used, &lt;New value&gt; is a character string containing the text of the note. |
| *hOwner* | Owner of data file. <br>If this constant is used, &lt;New value&gt; is a character string containing the name of the owner. |



**`<New value>: (Character string)`**

New value for the property.

**`<Database>: (Character string)`**

Name of the database containing the data file for which the properties must be modified. 
If this parameter corresponds to an empty string (""), the database defined in the connection will be used. 
A WLanguage error occurs if no database is defined in the connection.

**`<Data file>: (Character string)`**

Name of the data file for which the properties must be modified. The file extension must be specified.

## Remarks


### Changing the owner of a data file
<a name="changing_the_owner_data_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000136"></a>

- The user specified as new owner must be a user found on the server. A WLanguage error occurs if the user does not exist.

- To modify the owner, the user who performs the modification must:

	- be a "Super user".

	- have the rights to change the owner of the data file (rights corresponding to the *hRightsChangeOwner* constant). To determine if the user has the appropriate rights, use [HInfoFileProperty](../WDLang4/3044324.md).
