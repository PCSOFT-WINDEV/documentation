The following files are automatically created when logging an HFSQL Client/Server data file:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| **JNL_FILES.FIC** | Description of logged files. |
| **JNL_OPERATION.FIC** | Description of actions performed on a logged file. |
| **JNL_USERS.FIC** | Description of users who perform an action on a logged file. |
| **xxxJNL.FIC** | File created for each logged file. Contains the value of records used before and after each operation. |

These files are created according to the following structure:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Journal_CS.gif) | **1. __JNL directory**<br>This directory contains:<br><br>- The file log<br><br>- The user log<br><br>- The operation log<br><br>- For each logged file of each database, the corresponding log file. The tree structure used corresponds to the tree structure of the data files associated with the database.<br><br><br>**For example**, if the Orders file of DataApplicationA is logged, the __JNL\\DataApplicationA subdirectory will contain the OrdersJNL.FIC file.<br><br>**Another example**: if the Customer file of DataApplicationB is logged, the __JNL\\DataApplicationB\\Customer subdirectory will contain the CustomerJNL.FIC file.<br><br>**2. Database directory** DataApplicationA<br><br>**3. Database directory** DataApplicationB |

This page presents the structure of these files.
