Adds a scheduling for full backup (with or without differential backup) on the server defined by the connection. This backup scheduling was defined by an [hBackupDescription](../WDLang4/1000017455.md) variable.

## Example


```wl
// Describe the connection
DatabaseConnection is Connection
...
// Create a scheduled backup every 5 minutes 
// with a differential backup every minute
hBck is hBackupDescription
hBck.Enabled = True
hBck.WithIndex = True
hBck.Description = "Scheduled backup every N minutes with " + ...
	"an incremental backup every minut on the " + ...
	DBConnection.Database + " created on "+ ...
	DateToString(DateSys(), maskDateSystem) + " at "+  ...
	TimeToString(TimeSys(), "HH:MM:SS:CC")
hBck.Destination = "Backup_" + DBConnection.Database
hBck.LimitNumberBackups = 2
hBck.Source = DatabaseConnection.Database
hBck.SchedulingFull.Month = "*"
hBck.SchedulingFull.DayOfMonth = "*"
// Define the scheduling
dhServerDateTime is DateTime = DBConnection.InfoServer(hInfoDate)
dtServerDateTime.Minute++
hBck.SchedulingFull.Hour = dtServerDateTime.Hour
hBck.SchedulingFull.Minute = dtServerDateTime.Minute
hBck.SchedulingFull.DayOfWeek = "*"
hBck.SchedulingFull.DayOfMonthOrDayOfWeek = False
hBck.SchedulingDifferential.Month = "*"
hBck.SchedulingDifferential.DayOfMonth = "*"
hBck.SchedulingDifferential.Hour = "*"
hBck.SchedulingDifferential.Minute = "*"
hBck.SchedulingDifferential.DayOfWeek = "*"
hBck.SchedulingDifferential.DayOfMonthOrDayOfWeek = False

// Add the scheduled backup
IF DBConnection.AddScheduledBackup(hBck) = False THEN
	Error("Failure creating the scheduled backup", ...
		HErrorInfo(hErrFullDetails))
	RETURN
END

## Syntax

`<Result> = <Connection>.AddScheduledBackup(<Scheduled backup>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the scheduled backup was added,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise.




**`<Connection>: (Connection variable)`**

Name of the [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md) variable that describes the connection for which a scheduled backup must be added.

**`<Scheduled backup>: (hBackupDescription variable)`**

Name of the [hBackupDescription](../WDLang4/1000017455.md) variable used.

## Remarks


### Characteristics of backup:
<a name="characteristics_backup_ELTPARAGRAPHE000232"></a>

- Saving the content of an HFSQL server: all databases on the server, one or more databases, one or more data files. This backup can be performed even if one or more databases are currently used.

- **The database will be backed up at its state at the beginning of the backup: the backed up database is consistent.**Some operations are not allowed during the backup: deleting files or databases, updating stored procedures.

- The backup description is performed via the [hBackupDescription](../WDLang4/1000017455.md) variable. You can define:

	- a stored procedure to run BEFORE the backup. This procedure can cancel the backup if necessary.

	- a stored procedure to run AFTER the backup.

### Rights required to add a scheduled backup
<a name="rights_required_add_scheduled_backup_ELTPARAGRAPHE000250"></a>

To add a scheduled backup, the user or user group must have: 

- the rights to perform backups (*hRightsBackup* constant). These rights apply to the servers and to the databases. For example, to perform a full server backup, you must have the rights to perform backups at server level. 

- the rights to manage the tasks (*hRightsManageTask* constant).




To find out whether a user or a group of users has sufficient rights, use [&lt;Connection variable&gt;.InfoServerRights](../WDLang4/1000022668.md) or [&lt;Connection variable&gt;.InfoDatabaseRights](../WDLang4/1000022666.md).

To modify the rights granted to a user or to a group of users, use [&lt;Connection variable&gt;.ModifyServerRights](../WDLang4/1000022710.md) or [&lt;Connection variable&gt;.ModifyDatabaseRights](../WDLang4/1000022707.md).

### Operations on a scheduled backup
<a name="operations_scheduled_backup_ELTPARAGRAPHE000289"></a>

Several functions are used to handle a scheduled backup: 

- [&lt;Connection variable&gt;.ExecuteScheduledBackup](../WDLang4/1000022660.md): Used to run a scheduled backup. 

- [&lt;Connection variable&gt;.ListScheduledBackup](../WDLang4/1000022699.md): Used to list the scheduled backups. 

- [&lt;Connection variable&gt;.ModifyScheduledBackup](../WDLang4/1000022721.md): Used to modify the characteristics of a scheduled backup. 

- [&lt;Connection variable&gt;.DeleteScheduledBackup](../WDLang4/1000022766.md): Used to delete a scheduled backup. 




You can also: 

- restore a backup with [&lt;Connection variable&gt;.RestoreBackup](../WDLang4/1000022751.md).

- delete a backup physically with [&lt;Connection variable&gt;.DeleteBackup](../WDLang4/1000022765.md).
