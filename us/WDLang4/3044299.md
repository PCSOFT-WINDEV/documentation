Declares a (1,1) (0,n) link between two tables. Only the records found in the target table with a corresponding record in the source table (while respecting the filter of this one) will be replicated during a universal replication.

**Remark: This function can be used during the universal replication only.**

![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) Only the universal replication is available. 

Note: The replication is not available when accessing a database via .

## Syntax

`<Result> = HRplDeclareLink(<Name of source file> , <Name of source item> , <Name of target file> , <Name of target item>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the operation was performed, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if a problem occurred (the specified tables and items do not exist for example). [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) is used to identify the error. Caution: &lt;Result&gt; is set to <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> even if the specified files/tables are not replicated.




**`<Name of source file>: (Character string)`**

Name of the file or table whose multiplicity is set to (1, 1).

**`<Name of source item>: (Character string)`**

Name of the item affected by the link in the source file.

**`<Name of target file>: (Character string)`**

Name of the file or table whose multiplicity is set to (0, n).

**`<Name of target item>: (Character string)`**

Name of the item affected by the link in the target file.  



<a name="NOTE0"></a>
<a name="NOTE0_1"></a>

## Remarks


- The operation is taken into account only if the source table/file is specified AFTER the target table/file in the list of tables passed to [HCreateSubscriberReplica](../WDLang4/3044253.md).

- The filtering performed on the second file/table is not respected.

- As soon as a file is target of a declared link, this file is replicated via this link only.

- If a file is the source of two links, a record will be replicated if it belongs to one of the links.
