Used to restore: 

- an immediate backup (performed by [HBackup](../WDLang4/1000017081.md) or via the HFSQL Control Center).

- a scheduled backup (described by [HAddScheduledBackup](../WDLang4/1000018866.md) or via the HFSQL Control Center).


The restored backup can be a full backup or a differential backup.

**Caution: restoring a backup must be done with great care.**

To perform this operation, you must have the rights to perform a backup (*hRightsBackup*) as well as the rights to lock the database (*hRightsLock*).

**To restore the entire server** (or the __jnl and __trs databases), no other application must be connected to the server. The connection used must not be attached to a database (during the call to [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md), the &lt;Database&gt; parameter must correspond to an empty string ("")). 

**To restore the databases**, no connection must be established on the database to restore.

**Duplicating a database**: A special syntax of **HRestoreBackup** (syntax 2) is used to restore the backup of a database under a different name. This allows you to perform a copy of a database by renaming it. For example: to perform a copy of the MyDatabase2008 database by renaming it into MyDatabase2009, all you have to do is perform a backup of MyDatabase2008 and restore it under the MyDatabase2009 name.

```wl

```wl
ctServer is Connection

// Restore a full and differential backup

BackupInfo = HInfoBackup(ctServer, nBackupID_Full)
BackupPath_Comp = ExtractString(BackupInfo, 4, TAB)

IF HRestoreBackup(ctServer, BackupPath_Comp, BackupPath_Diff) = False THEN
	Error("Failure restoring the backup" + HErrorInfo(hErrMessage))
END

## Syntax

### Restoring a backup from its identifier or from its path

`<Result> = HRestoreBackup(<Connection> , <Backup> [, <Progress Bar>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the backup was restored,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) is used to identify the error.




**`<Connection>: (Character string or Connection variable)`**

Connection to the server where the restore will be performed. This connection corresponds to:

- the name of the connection defined in the data model editor or with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

- the name of a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md).




**`<Backup>: (Integer or character string)`**

Can correspond to:

- **Backup identifier**. This identifier can correspond to the identifier of full backup or to the identifier of differential backup. 
	During an immediate backup, this identifier is returned by [HBackup](../WDLang4/1000017081.md). This identifier can also be returned by [HInfoBackup](../WDLang4/1000017083.md).
	In a scheduled backup, this identifier corresponds to the **Identifier** property of the [hBackupDescription](../WDLang4/1000017455.md) variable. 

- **Path and name of backup to restore**. This name was specified during the backup. This name can also be returned by [HInfoBackup](../WDLang4/1000017083.md). If this name corresponds to a relative path, the backup will be sought in the "Backup" subdirectory of HFSQL server. To specify the directory of Manta service, simply use "%%EXE%%".




**`<Progress Bar>: (Optional window name, optional control name or optional integer)`**



- Name of the window where the progress bar will be displayed or name of the Progress Bar control.

- Handle of the window that displays the progress bar.

### Restoring a backup under a different database name

`<Result> = HRestoreBackup(<Connection> , <Backup> , <Source database> , <Destination database> [, <Progress Bar>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the backup was restored,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) is used to identify the error.




**`<Connection>: (Character string or Connection variable)`**

Connection to the server where the restore will be performed. This connection corresponds to: 

- the name of the connection defined in the data model editor or with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

- the name of a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md).




**`<Backup>: (Integer or character string)`**

Can correspond to:

- Backup identifier, returned by [HBackup](../WDLang4/1000017081.md). This identifier can also be returned by [HInfoBackup](../WDLang4/1000017083.md).  

- Path and name of backup to restore. This name was specified during the backup. This name can also be returned by [HInfoBackup](../WDLang4/1000017083.md). If this name corresponds to a relative path, the backup will be sought in the "Backup" subdirectory of HFSQL server. To specify the directory of Manta service, simply use "%%EXE%%".




**`<Source database>: (Character string)`**

Name of database to restore found in the backup. This syntax allows you to restore a single database found in the backup.

**`<Destination database>: (Character string)`**

Name of database that will be restored. This name may be different from the source database. In this case, the function allows you to make a copy of the database and rename it.

**`<Progress Bar>: (Optional window name, optional control name or optional integer)`**



- Name of the window where the progress bar will be displayed or name of the Progress Bar control.

- Handle of the window that displays the progress bar.

### Restoring a differential backup found in a specific directory (available from version 15)

`<Result> = HRestoreBackup(<Connection> , <Full backup> , <Differential backup> [, <Progress Bar>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the backup was restored,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) is used to identify the error.




**`<Connection>: (Character string or Connection variable)`**

Connection to the server where the restore will be performed. This connection corresponds to: 

- the name of the connection defined in the data model editor or with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

- the name of a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md).




**`<Full backup>: (Character string)`**

Path and name of the full backup to restore. This name was specified during the backup. This name can also be returned by [HInfoBackup](../WDLang4/1000017083.md). If this name corresponds to a relative path, the backup will be sought in the "Backup" subdirectory of HFSQL server. To specify the directory of Manta service, simply use "%%EXE%%".

**`<Differential backup>: (Character string)`**

Path and name of the differential backup that must be applied to the full backup. This name was specified during the backup. This name can also be returned by [HInfoBackup](../WDLang4/1000017083.md). If this name corresponds to a relative path, the backup will be sought in the "Backup" subdirectory of HFSQL server. To specify the directory of Manta service, simply use "%%EXE%%".

**`<Progress Bar>: (Optional window name, optional control name or optional integer)`**



- Name of the window where the progress bar will be displayed or name of the Progress Bar control.

- Handle of the window that displays the progress bar.

## Remarks


### Rights required to restore a backup
<a name="rights_required_restore_backup_ELTPARAGRAPHE000309"></a>

To restore a backup, the user or the group must have:

- the rights to perform backups (*hRightsBackup* constant). These rights apply to the servers and to the databases.

- the rights to lock the database (*hRightsLock* constant). These rights apply to the databases.




To find out whether these rights are granted to a user or to a group, use [HInfoServerRights](../WDLang4/3044322.md) or [HInfoDatabaseRights](../WDLang4/3044320.md).

To modify the rights granted to a user or to a group of users, use [HModifyServerRights](../WDLang4/3044328.md) or [HModifyDatabaseRights](../WDLang4/3044326.md).

### Restore operation performed from the HFSQL Control Center
<a name="restore_operation_performed_from_the_hfsql_control_center_ELTPARAGRAPHE000337"></a>

A backup can be restored from the HFSQL Control Center. This backup is available in the "Backups" tab of the server description.
