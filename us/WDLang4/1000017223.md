| Constant | Description | Used by the function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **replicaImmediate** | The replica is immediately created, during the synchronization. This replication mode can be quite long but it guarantees to be updated from the master database. | [ReplicSynchronize](../WDLang4/1000017196.md) |
| **replicaPeriodic** | The replica is created after each synchronization. During the next replication, the replica that was previously created is automatically used. This replication mode is fast but it does not guarantee to be "entirely updated" from the master database. | [ReplicSynchronize](../WDLang4/1000017196.md) |
| **replicaNoProgressBar** | From version 190044, a progress bar is displayed by default during the synchronization. This progress bar is adapted to the current platform. <br>This constant allows you not to display the progress bar and to restore the previous behavior. <br>This constant can be combined with the *replicaImmediate* and *replicaPeriodic* constants. | [ReplicSynchronize](../WDLang4/1000017196.md) |
| **replicSynchronizationRequestDate** | Date of last synchronization request. | [ReplicInfo](../WDLang4/1000017197.md) |
| **replicSynchronizationDate** | Date of last synchronization. | [ReplicInfo](../WDLang4/1000017197.md) |
| **replicExist** | Checks the existence of the replication. | [ReplicInfo](../WDLang4/1000017197.md) |
| **replicInitialized** | Checks whether the replication is initialized. | [ReplicInfo](../WDLang4/1000017197.md) |
