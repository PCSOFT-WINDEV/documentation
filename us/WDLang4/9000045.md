## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000117"></a>
To easily establish the universal replication between the data of a remote application and a central database, WINDEV and WEBDEV allow you to:

- **create a replication** via a replication editor (ReplicEdit). This editor is used to define the characteristics of a replication.

- **implement an automatic replication on the data of an application**. The replication is directly performed by the end users via two tools:

	- ReplicSynchro, used to perform a replication.

	- ReplicAdmin, used to manage the replications.
			For more details, see [Implementing an automatic assisted universal replication](../WDLang4/9000046.md).




- **implement a programmed replication included in an application** via WLanguage functions. These functions are used to handle a replication and to perform the synchronization.
	For more details, see [Implementing a programmed assisted universal replication](../WDLang4/9000047.md).




**Remarks**:

- No replication can be directly deployed on a computer without using an application.  

- Some features are not available in this version. For more details, see [Specific features of assisted universal replication](../WDLang4/9000048.md). 

- **Management of automatic data modification**: Replication can take into account automatic data modification for HFSQL databases. For more details, see [Specific features of assisted universal replication](../WDLang4/9000048.md). 

- The assisted universal replication is available for the replication of mobile data (Android or iOS). For more details, see [Replication of mobile data (Android or iOS)](../WDLang4/1000021071.md).

## Principle of the assisted universal replication
<a name="principle_the_assisted_universal_replication_ELTTEXTE000147"></a>
The purpose of the assisted universal replication is to propose a quick replication for any type of application.

The assisted universal replication proposes the following modes of replication:

- **direct replication**: The replication is directly performed between the local database and the master database. This replication mode is recommended when a computer must connect to the local network for example. This replication mode requires no specific configuration.

- **replication by server**: the replication is performed via a replication server. The transfer of replicas is automatically managed.




***The replication via server can be performed with immediate replica***: in this case, the data is immediately synchronized. The subscriber database sends the data to replicate, the replication is performed and the subscriber database retrieves the data to update. This operation can take quite a long time. This replication mode is recommended for a daily synchronization for example (a salesperson synchronizes every evening with the office).

***The replication by server can be performed with delayed replica***: in this case, the data is synchronized when the exchanges are performed with the server. When the server receives the data to replicate, it automatically prepares the data to return. This data will be returned during the next synchronization. This replication mode is recommended for a periodic synchronization (whenever an order is placed for example).

The data structures are identical on each site but they can be exploited via different data managers. HFSQL Classic and Access will be used in this example.<br>The example presents the processes that must be included in your applications to allow the user, via a simple action (menu, button, ...), to:<br>- create a master replica, <br>- create one or more subscriber replicas, <br>- see and modify the data of these replicas, <br>- export the created or modified data to a site (portable replica), <br>- import the created or modified data into another site...
