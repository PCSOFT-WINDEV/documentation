<a name="description"></a>
Synchronizes the data corresponding to a replication. This replication was created by the replication editor (ReplicEdit).  






<a name="Example1"></a>
<a name="sample_code"></a>

## Example


```wl
// Starts the synchronization
ReplicSynchronize("MyReplication")
```

<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

## Syntax

### Synchronization in direct mode

`<Result> = ReplicSynchronize(<Replication name>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the synchronization was performed,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. For more details about the problem, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md).




**`<Replication name>: (Character string)`**

Name of replication to synchronize. This name corresponds to the name of the ".wer" file created by ReplicEdit. This file must be found beside the executable.  


<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Synchronization with a replication server

`<Result> = ReplicSynchronize(<Replication name> [, <Options>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the synchronization was performed,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. For more details about the problem, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md).




**`<Replication name>: (Character string)`**

Name of replication to synchronize. This name corresponds to the publication name for a replication server.

**`<Options>: (Optional Integer constant)`**

Type of replication to perform. These options are taken into account for a replication with a replication server. 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *replicaImmediate* | The replica is immediately created, during the synchronization.<br><br>This replication mode can be quite long but it guarantees to be updated from the master database. |
| *replicaNoProgressBar* | By default, a progress bar is displayed during synchronization. This progress bar is adapted to the current platform. <br>This constant allows you to no longer display the progress bar.<br>This constant can be combined with the *replicaImmediate* and *replicaPeriodic* constants. |
| *replicaPeriodic*<br> (Default value) | The replica that is taken into account is the replica that is available on the server.<br><br>**If the replica is periodically created on the server**, the last created replica is taken into account.<br><br>**If the replica is not periodically created on the server**, the last generated replica is taken into account. This last replica was generated just after the last synchronization.<br><br>This replication mode is fast but it does not guarantee to be "entirely updated" from the master database. |


**Remark**: you should use the same type of replication as the one defined on the server.

## Remarks


### Replication and WithSpace function
<a name="replication_and_withspace_function_ELTPARAGRAPHE000131"></a>

The replication is not compatible with [WithSpace](../WDLang4/3044142.md) in the code of the client application. This function changes the nehavior of HFSQL. Using this function in the client application can affect the efficiency of replication.

From version 21 update 3 (version 210065), the synchronization functions (programmed or assisted universal replication) return an error to the client application if [WithSpace](../WDLang4/3044142.md) was applied to at least one of the replicated files.

### Replication via a replication server
<a name="replication_via_replication_server_ELTPARAGRAPHE000149"></a>

During a replication via a replication server (especially for the [replication of mobile data (Android or iOS)](../WDLang4/1000021071.md)), the Web server that is hosting the replication server must be configured to allow the data upload and download. Therefore, the option "Maximum authorized length for content" configured in "Filtering requests" of an IIS server must be greater than the size of subscriber data (RPA).
