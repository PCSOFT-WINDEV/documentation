***In french: &lt;Source&gt;.CréationSiInexistant***



<a name="XUse"></a>
<a name="Use"></a>
<a name="description"></a>
Performs the following operations:

- If the data file does not exist, creates an empty data file (".FIC" extension) with the index file and the memo file if necessary.
	The function is equivalent to [&lt;Source&gt;.Creation](../WDLang4/1000024207.md).

- If the data file exists, opens the data file. 
	In this case, the function is equivalent to [&lt;Source&gt;.Open](../WDLang4/1000025043.md). 
	To optimize the call to **&lt;Source&gt;.CreationIfNotFound**, the file can be opened only when accessing the data file for the first time (using the *hDelayedOpening* constant).




**Remark**: The automatic creation of non-existing data files can be enabled in the project description ("Files" tab of the project description, "Automatically create the data files when they are opened"). **&lt;Source&gt;.CreationIfNotFound** is automatically used if the data file does not exist when it is handled for the first time.
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![HFSQL Classic](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HF.png) If the data file is logged, you can specify the location of the log files.![HFSQL Client/Server](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HFCS.png) If integrity constraints have been defined and if they are supported, the links are updated by the server when creating the data file.

## Syntax

`<Result> = <Source>.CreationIfNotFound([<Password> [, <Path of the JNL file> [, <Path of the JournalOperation file>]] [, <Option>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the data file was created or opened,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if a problem occurs. [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) is used to identify the error. If a fatal error occurs, a specific process is required to continue the program and to check whether the data file was created (see the Notes).




**`<Source>: (Type corresponding to the specified source)`**

Name of data file to use. 



**`<Password>: (Optional character string)`**



- Password associated with the data file. 

- Empty string ("") if no password is used.




**`<Path of the JNL file>: (Optional character string)`**

Access path to the JNL file associated with the logged data file. This parameter is only taken into account if the data file is logged. In this case, &lt;File name&gt;JNL.fic will be created at the specified location.
![HFSQL Client/Server](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HFCS.png) This parameter must not be specified. In HFSQL Client/Server, the path of JNL file is defined and it cannot be modified.![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Access by JDBC: This parameter is ignored.

**`<Path of the JournalOperation file>: (Optional character string)`**

Access path to the JournalOperation file and to the JournalIdentification file associated with the logged data file. The JournalOperation file contains all the operations performed on the logged data file. This parameter is only taken into account if the data file is logged.
![HFSQL Client/Server](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HFCS.png) This parameter must not be specified. In HFSQL Client/Server, the path of operation file is defined and it cannot be modified.![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Access by JDBC: This parameter is ignored.

**`<Option>: (Optional constant)`**

Optimize the opening of existing data files.

### Characteristics of created data file
<a name="characteristics_created_data_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000405"></a>

The characteristics of created data file are as follows:

- *Name of the data file*:
	Physical name defined during the file description in the data model editor. This name can be modified by [&lt;Source&gt;.ChangeName](../WDLang4/1000024201.md) before creating the data file.

- *Directory of data file*:
	Directory defined during the file description in the data model editor. This directory can be modified by [&lt;Source&gt;.ChangeDir](../WDLang4/1000024202.md) and [HSubstDir](../WDLang4/3044028.md) before creating the data file.
	**Remark**: If the UAC is enabled (Windows Vista and later), the data location is specific: the data will not be located in the application directory, but in a specific Windows directory. In this case, you must create the application data directory (you can get the path with [fDataDirUser](../WDLang1/3036071.md)).

- The order of items created in the physical file is the physical order of items created in the analysis (and not the logical order).

- *Content of the data file*:
	The created data file is empty, which does not mean that its size is null (the file contains a header describing its structure).


**Remark**: If the data file already existed (same name, same directory), this data file is opened. If the *hDelayedOpening* constant is specified, the data file will only be opened the first time it is accessed (optimizes the speed of **&lt;Source&gt;.CreationIfNotFound**).

### Additional files created
<a name="additional_files_created_ELTPARAGRAPHE000450"></a>

When creating a data file, the following files can be created in addition to the data file:

- **An index file** (".NDX" extension) if one or more keys have been defined in the file description.

- **A memo file** (".MMO" extension) if one or more memo items have been defined in the file description.

- **A log file** (".JNL" extension). This file is created only if the corresponding option was selected during the file description (see next paragraph).
	![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) This file is not created.

- **A &lt;ProjectName&gt;.REP file**. This file contains the list of data files handled by the application. This file is created (or filled) if the management of .REP is enabled ([HSetREP](../WDLang4/3044061.md)). If the *hDelayedOpening* constant is specified, the .REP file will be updated during the automatic file opening performed during the first access to the data file. For more details, see [.REP file](../WDLang4/3044186.md).
	![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) This file is not created.



<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Managing passwords
<a name="managing_passwords_ELTPARAGRAPHE000479"></a>

The password can be defined:

- when the data file is created or opened by **&lt;Source&gt;.CreationIfNotFound**.

- before the data file is created by [&lt;Source&gt;.Password](../WDLang4/1000025044.md).**Caution**: The password is independent of data encryption. The data encryption must be configured during the file description in the data model editor ("Details" tab).


![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) The password is not associated with a data file but with a database. This password must be specified during the connection ([HConnect](../WDLang4/3044263.md)).
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Managing fatal errors when creating a data file
<a name="managing_fatal_errors_when_creating_data_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000506"></a>If a fatal error occurs when creating a data file, it may be interesting to continue the program while checking whether the data file was created or not. To do so, we recommend that you perform the following exception process:

```wl
WHEN EXCEPTION IN
	Parent.CreationIfNotFound()
DO
	Error("HFSQL error: " + HError())
ELSE
	Trace("The file is created")
END
```

### Managing non-Latin character sets 
<a name="managing_nonlatin_character_sets_ELTPARAGRAPHE000524"></a>

If the *hChangeCharset* constant is specified, the character set used in the data file will be the one specified by [ChangeCharset](../WDLang1/3054001.md). Sorts, searches, ... on string keys (strings, characters, date and time) will be performed according to this character set.

The character set used can be modified by [&lt;Source&gt;.Index](../WDLang4/1000025060.md).

**Remark**: the size of string items specified in the analysis is expressed in bytes and not in characters. Depending on the character set used, you may have to increase the item size (if the characters used are coded on 2 bytes for example).

For more details, see [Managing specific character sets in the data files](../WDLang1/3054017.md).

### Replication: Range of identifiers
<a name="replication_range_identifiers_ELTPARAGRAPHE000553"></a>

The automatic identifiers for the files of subscriber replicas are using a range of identifiers that differs from the one used by the file of master replica and by the other files of subscriber replicas.

This range of automatic identifiers is written in the header of each data file (".FIC" extension).
This range is initialized:

- when creating a data file ([&lt;Source&gt;.Creation](../WDLang4/1000024207.md), **&lt;Source&gt;.CreationIfNotFound**).

- via [WDReplic](../WDReplic/3520016.md).

- when [&lt;Source&gt;.InitSubscriber](../WDLang4/1000024998.md) is used.


For more details, see the [consequences of implementing the replication](../WDLang4/3044246.md).

### Priority for defining the location of log files
<a name="priority_for_defining_the_location_log_files_ELTPARAGRAPHE000593"></a>

The location of log files is defined according to the following priority order:

1. Location specified when creating the logged data file (**&lt;Source&gt;.CreationIfNotFound**).

2. Location specified by [&lt;Source&gt;.ChangeLogDir](../WDLang4/1000024203.md).

3. Location specified in the analysis.

4. Location of the logged data file.




If another application uses [&lt;Source&gt;.DeclareExternal](../WDLang4/1000024214.md) on a logged data file, the changes made by this application are saved in the log files specified in the header of the logged HFSQL data file.
![HFSQL Client/Server](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HFCS.png) The location of Log files is fixed and it cannot be modified. For more details, see [Log files in Client/Server mode](../WDLang4/3044197.md).

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png) 

### Creating or opening an existing table
<a name="creating_opening_existing_table_ELTPARAGRAPHE000630"></a>

If the table already exists, the table is opened.

If the table does not already exist, the table is created. When creating a table, WINDEV and WEBDEV try to create the items in the OLE DB type corresponding to the HFSQL type. If this type is not supported, the HFSQL engine successively tries all the "compatible" OLEDB types until it finds a type that is supported by the OLEDB database.

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) 

### Managing indexes
<a name="managing_indexes_ELTPARAGRAPHE000644"></a>

**&lt;Source&gt;.CreationIfNotFound** does not return any error messages if an index cannot be added. The table is created without the index that is causing the problem. In this case, duplicates may be found in an item defined as unique key by WINDEV or WEBDEV if the external database does not support the unique keys.
<a name="NOTE0_10"></a>


### Creating the data file from its description
<a name="creating_the_data_file_from_its_description_ELTPARAGRAPHE000656"></a>

The data file can be directly created from its description in the data model editor. To do so, select "Create the data file" from the popup menu of the data file (in the analysis graph) and select the directory in which the data file must be created.
