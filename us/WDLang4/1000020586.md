| Constant | Description | Used by the function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **hmcrHigherPriority** | Method for solving conflicts: During a conflict, only the priority value defined for the server is taken into account. The smaller the priority value defined for the server is, the higher the priority granted to the server will be. | [hRSConfig](../WDLang4/1000020484.md) variable |
| **hmcrMoreRecent** | Method for solving conflicts: During a conflict, the more recent element has priority.<br>Caution: This method requires a synchronization of the clock on the different servers. | [hRSConfig](../WDLang4/1000020484.md) variable |
| **hmcrProcedureAllItems** | Method for solving conflicts: When a conflict occurs, a stored procedure (defined with the **ProcedureForModificationConflictResolution** property) is started. In this procedure, all the items found in the record will be accessible. | [hRSConfig](../WDLang4/1000020484.md) variable |
| **hmcrProcedureWithModifiedItems** | Method for solving conflicts: When a conflict occurs, a stored procedure (defined with the **ProcedureForModificationConflictResolution** property) is started. In this procedure, only the modified items will be accessible. | [hRSConfig](../WDLang4/1000020484.md) variable |
| **hrsDefault** | Deletes the replication only if the subscriber server is accessible. | [HRSDeleteConfig](../WDLang4/1000020493.md) |
| **hrsIgnoreSubscriber** | Forces the deletion even if the other server cannot be contacted. | [HRSDeleteConfig](../WDLang4/1000020493.md) |
| **hrsInactive** | Role of server in the replication: Inactive computer in the replication between HFSQL servers. | [HRSInfo](../WDLang4/1000020574.md), [HRSInit](../WDLang4/1000020541.md) |
| **hrsMaster** | Role of server in the replication: Master computer in the replication between HFSQL servers. | [HRSInfo](../WDLang4/1000020574.md), [HRSInit](../WDLang4/1000020541.md), [HRSListConfig](../WDLang4/1000020497.md) |
| **hrsSubscriber** | <br><br>- Role of server in the replication: Subscriber computer in the replication between HFSQL servers.<br><br>- Forces the deletion of an orphan replication on the subscriber side.<br><br><br> | <br><br>- [HRSInfo](../WDLang4/1000020574.md), [HRSInit](../WDLang4/1000020541.md), [HRSListConfig](../WDLang4/1000020497.md)<br><br>- [HRSDeleteConfig](../WDLang4/1000020493.md)<br><br><br> |
