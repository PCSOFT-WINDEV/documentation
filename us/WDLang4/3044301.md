## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000279"></a>
In order for the application to be able to handle the data files found on the HFSQL server, the connection that will be used by the application must be defined in the project. The connection can be defined:

- from the data model editor.

- through programming.




You also have the ability to allow an application to use a HFSQL Client/Server database or a HFSQL Classic database.

The data files accessed by an HFSQL server are accessible via this server only. They cannot be directly accessed by another application especially via the HFSQL Classic engine. A connection to the server is required to access these data files.

**Remark**: Several connections can be defined if the application uses several databases or several servers.

## Defining the connections from the data model editor
<a name="defining_the_connections_from_the_data_model_editor_ELTTEXTE000309"></a>
To define a connection from the data model editor:

1. On the "Analysis" tab, in the "Connection" group, click "New connection". The wizard for defining a new connection starts.

2. Keep "HFSQL Client/Server" and go to the next step of the wizard.

3. In the different steps of the wizard, enter the requested information: 

	- server name, 

	- number of the network port, 

	- name and password of the user, 

	- database, 

	- name and caption of the connection. 




4. Validate the wizard.
	A dialog box allows you to associate the data files with this new connection. Accept.

5. Select the data files to associate and validate. The existing data files can be directly copied onto the HFSQL server. This operation can be performed later if necessary.

6. Display the list of connections: on the "Analysis" tab, in the "Connection" group, click "Connections".

	- Run the test of this new connection if necessary: click the "Run the test" button.

	- The different tabs are used to view and modify the characteristics of the connections: 

		- "Properties" tab: characteristics of the connection defined in the wizard (name, caption, type, ...)

		- "Advanced" tab: Port number of the connection, options for compressing and encrypting the connection data. 
						If the data files that use the connection are encrypted, the connection should be encrypted as well. 

		- "Used by" tab: List of data files that use the connection. 




7. Close the window of defined connections.




At run time, the connection associated with the data file used will be automatically opened during the first access to this data file.

Data files associated with an "HFSQL Client/Server" connection are automatically transformed into "HFSQL Client/Server" data files.

To identify them, a "HFSQL/CS" indication is displayed at the bottom of the graphic description of these files. Furthermore, the color associated with this area becomes orange: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=PictoHFSQLCS.gif)

### Encrypting a connection
<a name="encrypting_connection_ELTPARAGRAPHE000089"></a>

To encrypt a connection: 

1. Display the description of the connection: on the "Analysis" tab, in the "Connection" group, click "Connections".

2. Select the connection to encrypt.

3. Go to the "Advanced" tab.

4. Select the encryption mode: Fast or RC5 (16 rounds).

5. Validate.




Remark: If the data files that use the connection are encrypted, the connection should be encrypted as well.

## Defining the connections through programming
<a name="defining_the_connections_through_programming_ELTTEXTE000339"></a>
Several methods can be used to define a connection through programming:

- Using the [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md) functions.

- Using the [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md) type and its properties.



<a name="NOTE3_2"></a>


### Defining a connection with HDescribeConnection or HOpenConnection
<a name="defining_connection_with_hdescribeconnection_hopenconnection_ELTPARAGRAPHE000135"></a>

To define a connection with **HDescribeConnection** or **HOpenConnection**: 


1. Define the connection with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).
	The &lt;Data Source&gt; parameter must correspond to the name or IP address of the server that will be used. If the network port to use differs from the default port (port 4900), &lt;Data Source&gt; must have the following format: 
	"&lt;NameOrIPAddressOfServer&gt;:&lt;PortNumber&gt;".
	The &lt;OLEDB Provider or Native Connector&gt; parameter must correspond to the *hAccessHFClientServer* constant.
	For example:
	
	```wl
	HDescribeConnection("MyConnection", "Julia", "Password", "MyHFServer", ...
				"MyDatabase", hAccessHFClientServer, HORead)
	```

	or
	
	```wl
	HOpenConnection("ConnectionServer", "Stephen", "", "DataServer:5400", ...
				"MyData", hAccessHFClientServer)
	```


2. Open the connection with **HOpenConnection**.
	This step is not required if the connection was defined and opened by **HOpenConnection** beforehand.
	

3. Associate the connection with the different data files using [HChangeConnection](../WDLang4/3044150.md).
	For example: 
	
	```wl
	HChangeConnection(Customer, "MyConnection")
	```

	or, to associate all the analysis files with the connection: 
	
	```wl
	HChangeConnection("*", "ConnectionServer")
	```



**Remark**: To encrypt the connection, all you have to do is specify the specific extended information ("ENCRYPTION = FAST" or "ENCRYPTION = RC5_16". For more details, see the documentation about [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

### Defining a connection via the Connection type
<a name="defining_connection_via_the_connection_type_ELTPARAGRAPHE000189"></a>

To define a connection using the [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md) type: 

1. Define the connection using the [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md) type and its properties.
	For example:
	
	```wl
	MyConnection is Connection
	// Describe the connection
	MyConnection.User = "USER"
	MyConnection.Password = "PASSWORD"
	MyConnection.Server = "MYSERVER" 
	MyConnection.Database = "Database"
	MyConnection.Provider = hAccessHFClientServer
	MyConnection.Access = hOReadWrite
	MyConnection.ExtendedInfo = "Extended information"
	MyConnection.CursorOptions = hClientCursor
	```


2. Open the connection with **HOpenConnection**.
	For example:
	
	```wl
	MyConnection is Connection
	// Describe the connection
	MyConnection.User = "USER"
	MyConnection.Password = "PASSWORD"
	MyConnection.Server = "MYSERVER" 
	MyConnection.Database = "Database"
	MyConnection.Provider = hAccessHFClientServer
	MyConnection.Access = hOReadWrite
	MyConnection.ExtendedInfo = "Extended information"
	MyConnection.CursorOptions = hClientCursor
	```



**Remark**: To encrypt the connection, simply use the [Encryption](../Proprietes/2512102.md) property on the connection.
For example:

```wl
MyConnection is Connection
// Describe the connection
MyConnection.User = "USER"
MyConnection.Password = "PASSWORD"
MyConnection.Server = "MYSERVER" 
MyConnection.Database = "Database"
MyConnection.CryptMethod = hCryptRC5_16
MyConnection.Provider = hAccessHFClientServer
MyConnection.Access = hOReadWrite
MyConnection.ExtendedInfo = "Extended information"

HOpenConnection(MyConnection)
```

## Allowing a WINDEV application to use an HFSQL Client/Server database or an HFSQL Classic database
<a name="allowing_windev_application_use_hfsql_clientserver_database_hfsql_classic_database_ELTTEXTE000377"></a>
Two WLanguage functions allow you to use any database chosen at runtime. Regardless of the type of data files specified in the analysis.

This can be very useful for an application installed on a laptop computer:

- connected to the network, the application uses the HFSQL Client/Server database, 

- disconnected, the application uses a local copy of the database.




The code that should be used (at the beginning of project, before using the data files) is as follows:


```wl
ServerAddress is string = "198.168.1.120"

IF Ping(ServerAddress) THEN
	// The server is accessible, HF C/S connection
	HOpenConnection("HFCSConnection", "admin", "", ServerAddress, "CRM", hAccessHFClientServer)
    	HChangeConnection("*", "HFCSConnection")
    	Info("Connected mode to the network database.")
ELSE
   	// The server does not respond, use the local HF database
   	HOpenConnection("LocalHFConnection", "", "", "C:\Data Directory\", "", hAccessHF7)
   	HChangeConnection("*", "LocalHFConnection")
   	Info("Disconnected mode, you are using your data locally.")
END
```
