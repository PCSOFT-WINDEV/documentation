## Managing space characters in the searches
<a name="managing_space_characters_the_searches_ELTTEXTE000395"></a>
Two types of search can be performed in the HFSQL data files:

- **exact-match search**: search for all the records that exactly match the specified value.

- **generic search**: search for all the records that start with the specified value.




**In WINDEV 5.5**, the space characters were used to fill the text items.
The searches were generic searches by default.
To perform an exact-match search, the sought value had to be filled with space characters on the size of the item ([Complete](../WDLang1/3024010.md)). If this value was not filled with spaces, then a generic search was performed.

**From WINDEV 8**, for all the files created in the data model editor, the space characters are considered as being meaningful space characters.
The space characters are considered like any other character. A space character is found in an item only if this space character was typed.
The generic searches and the exact-match searches are no longer differentiated by the use of space characters.
The searches are exact-match searches by default.
To perform a generic search, the *hGeneric* constant must be used in [HReadSeekFirst](../WDLang4/3044036.md).

New search features are available. Search options can be defined for the text key items. These options allow you to perform a search:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| <br><br>- sensitive to the case or not.<br><br>- sensitive to accented characters or not.<br><br>- sensitive to space characters and to the punctuation or not.<br><br><br> | <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=recherche.gif)<br><br><br>Option displayed in the "File item" window, <br>*"General" tab of a text key item.* |

**For backward compatibility with WINDEV 5.5**, the data model editor proposes the "5.5-compatible mode" (available in the "Details" tab of the file description). This mode is automatically selected for:

- the files in 5.5 format found in a WINDEV 28 analysis.

- the files in 5.5 format migrated to WINDEV 28.

## Space characters and searches: migration from Hyper File 5.5 to HFSQL Classic
<a name="space_characters_and_searches_migration_from_hyper_file_55_hfsql_classic_ELTTEXTE000449"></a>
The table below presents the different types of search according to:

- the type of the HFSQL data file used: File in Hyper File 5.5 format, File in Hyper File 5.5 format migrated to HFSQL Classic format, File in HFSQL Classic format.

- the mode for storing text items (5.5-compatible mode or Classic Mode)




The search options for text keys are checked.
