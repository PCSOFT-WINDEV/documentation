The **hdfsConnection** type is used to define the advanced characteristics of a connection to the Hadoop file system (HDFS). The characteristics of this connection can be defined and changed using different WLanguage properties. 

**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).
