## Example


```wl
// Describe the connection
MyConnection is Connection

sRights is string
sARight is string
// Retrieves the read/add rights granted to the usernamed Moore 
// on the MyFile.fic file found in MyDatabase
sRights = MyConnection.InfoFileRights("Moore", hRightsRead + hRightsInsert, ...
									 "MyBase", "MyFile.fic")
sARight = ExtractString(sRights, firstRank, TAB)
WHILE sARight <> EOT
	SWITCH sARight
		CASE hAllowed
		...
		CASE hForbidden
		...
		CASE hInherit
		... 
	END
	sARight = ExtractString(sRights, nextRank, TAB)
END

## Syntax

`<Result> = <Connection>.InfoFileRights(<User/Group> , <Rights> , <Database> , <Data file> [, <Display mode>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Character string)`**



- Requested information, 

- Empty string ("") if an error occurred. 

- "Unknown user" or "Unknown group" if the current user has no permissions to see other users (*hRightsSeeUser* constant) and wants to get information about another user or group.




**In hDefault mode**, &lt;Result&gt; is a list of values separated by tabs. Each value in the list corresponds to the rights requested by &lt;Rights&gt;. The values in the list can correspond to one of the following constants:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hAllowed* | The relevant rights are granted to the user or group. |
| *hForbidden* | The relevant rights are not granted to the user or group. |
| *hInherit* | The user belongs to at least one group to which the relevant rights were granted.<br>This constant is returned only if the display mode is not set to *hEffective*. |


**In hDetails mode**, &lt;Result&gt; is a list of values with the following format: 

```txt
<Relevant rights 1> + TAB + <Value of rights 1> + CR + ... 
<Relevant rights N> + TAB + <Value of rights N> + CR
```

The rights correspond to the constants used in the &lt;Rights&gt; parameter and the values of the rights correspond to the *hAllowed*, *hForbidden* or *hInherited* constant (see the above table).

**`<Connection>: (Connection variable)`**

Name of the [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md) variable that describes the connection for which the rights of a user or group of users must be known.

**`<User/Group>: (Character string)`**

Name of the user or group whose rights must be known.

**`<Rights>: (Integer constant (or combination of constants))`**

List of rights to find:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hRightsAll* | List of all the rights.<br>We recommend that you use this constant in *hDetails* or *hEffective* + *hDetails* display mode. |
| *hRightsAutoModif* | Rights to perform an automatic modification on a data file. |
| *hRightsChangeLink* | Rights to modify the integrity rules on a data file. |
| *hRightsChangeOwner* | Rights to modify the owner of an element. |
| *hRightsChangeRights* | Rights to change rights. |
| *hRightsDelete* | Rights to delete the records from a data file. |
| *hRightsDeleteFile* | Rights to delete a data file ([&lt;Connection variable&gt;.DeleteFile](../WDLang4/1000022757.md)) |
| *hRightsInsert* | Rights to add new records into a data file. |
| *hRightsLock* | Rights to lock the files or the records of a data file. |
| *hRightsMaintenance* | Rights to start a re-index operation or to perform statistical calculations on a data file. |
| *hRightsManageDuplicate* | Rights to enable and disable the management of duplicates. |
| *hRightsRead* | Rights to read the records of a data file. |
| *hRightsUpdate* | Rights to modify the records of a data file. |



**`<Database>: (Character string)`**

Name of the database containing the data file for which the rights are requested. 
If the database corresponds to the one defined in the connection, this parameter can correspond to an empty string (""). 
A WLanguage error occurs if no database is defined in the connection and if this parameter corresponds to an empty string.

**`<Data file>: (Character string)`**

Name of the HFSQL data file on the server for which rights are requested. The extension of the data file must be specified.

**`<Display mode>: (Optional Integer constant)`**

Result display mode:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hDefault*<br>(Default value) | The rights returned do not take the inherited rights into account (rights granted to the groups to which the user belongs).<br>If no rights were defined, the value will be set to *hInherit*.<br>&lt;Result&gt; contains the values of the requested rights (in the same order). |
| *hDetails* | Same as *hDefault*. <br>&lt;Result&gt; contains the rights and there value. |
| *hEffective* | The rights returned correspond to the rights actually granted to the user or to the group on the data file. The inherited rights are taken into account (rights granted to the groups to which the user belongs for example). |
| *hEffective + hDetails* | Same as *hEffective*. <br>&lt;Result&gt; contains the rights and there value. |
