Modifies the rights granted to a user or to a group for a HFSQL Client/Server database.

## Example


```wl
// Describe the connection
MyConnection is Connection

// Copy the rights from a user to another one
sRights is string
sRights = MyConnection.InfoDatabaseRights("Moore", hRightsRead + hRightsInsert, "MyDatabase")
MyConnection.ModifyDatabaseRights("Moore", hRightsRead + hRightsInsert, sRights, "MyDatabase")
```

## Syntax

`<Result> = <Connection>.ModifyDatabaseRights(<User or group> , <Rights to modify> , <New values> , <Database>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the rights have been modified, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) is used to identify the error. 


No modification is performed if the new value is already assigned to the specified rights.

**Remark**: [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) will return an "Unknown user" or "Unknown group" error if the current user does not have the rights to see the users (*hRightsSeeUser* constant) and if he wants to get information about another user or another group.

**`<Connection>: (Connection variable)`**

Name of the [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md) variable that describes the connection for which the rights of a user or group of users must be modified.

**`<User or group>: (Character string)`**

Name of the user or group whose rights must be modified.

**`<Rights to modify>: (Integer constant (or combination of constants))`**

**`<New values>: (Integer constants)`**

If a single value is indicated in this parameter, it will be assigned to all the rights specified in &lt;Rights to modify&gt;.

| --- | --- |
| *hAllowed* | The relevant rights are granted to the user or group. |

## Remarks


### When are rights changed? 
<a name="when_are_rights_changed_ELTPARAGRAPHE000410"></a>

The change is effective as soon as **&lt;Connection variable&gt;.ModifyDatabaseRights** is run. There is no need to restart the server to take the new rights into account.

**Managing duplicates and integrity**: The error does not occur when the management mode is modified but when an attempt is made not to comply with the integrity constraint (or with the duplicate constraint).
