### Operations required to run Native Access Connectors in WINDEV and WEBDEV
<a name="operations_required_run_native_access_connectors_windev_and_webdev_ELTPARAGRAPHE000011"></a>

This type of Native Connector allows access to ACCESS databases for better interoperability purposes. We recommend that you use HFSQL, the database engine included in WINDEV and WEBDEV.



To use a Native Access Connector, you need to install:

- MDAC.

- the Microsoft Jet provider (installed with Access or Internet Explorer 6.0 for example).




Remark: Native Access Connectors are available in Access 2007 and later (ACCDB and MDB files).

## Creating an application that uses a Native Access Connector
<a name="creating_application_that_uses_native_access_connector_ELTTEXTE000149"></a>
To create an application using Access tables, import the structure of these tables into the WINDEV or WEBDEV data model editor: 

1. Open the analysis associated with the project: click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Ico_Analyse.gif) in the quick access buttons.

2. On the "Analysis" tab, in the "Creation" group, expand "Import" and select "Import file/table descriptions...".




**If you choose to keep the data in Access format**, the Access tables can be directly handled by the WLanguage functions for managing data files (starting with the letter H). A connection to the Access database is automatically established. 
Remark: if the path of the Access tables used differs during the development and when running the application, use [HChangeDir](../WDLang4/3044168.md) and [HChangeName](../WDLang4/3044141.md).

**If you choose to convert the data to HFSQL format**, data files in HFSQL format will be created from the structure of Access tables. These HFSQL files can be handled by the functions for managing the data files (starting with the letter H).

## Native Access Connector with WINDEV 5.5. What to do with a new WINDEV version?
<a name="native_access_connector_with_windev_55_what_with_new_windev_version_ELTTEXTE000173"></a>
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) In WINDEV 5.5, [SQLConnect](../WDLang4/3072005.md) allowed you to use the Native Access Connector. Once connected to an Access database, all the standard SQL functions allowed you to access and modify the data found in the database.

This operating mode is kept in the later versions of WINDEV.
