The **File Description** variable is used to programmatically describe data files. The description of each data file is validated by [HDescribeFile](../WDLang4/3044206.md).

After this validation:

- This data file can be handled like any other data file described in the analysis.

- The "File Description" variable is reinitialized and can be used to describe another data file.

## Example


```wl
AFile is File Description
MyFile1, MyFile2 are File Descriptions
```


<a name="Example2"></a>



```wl
// Describe the "CUSTOMER" data file
AFile is File Description

AFile.Name = "CUSTOMER"
AFile.Type = hFileNormal
AFile.FicCryptMethod = hCryptStandard

// Description of the data file items
...

// Validate the description of "CUSTOMER"
HDescribeFile(AFile)

### How to describe data files programmatically? 
<a name="how_describe_data_files_programmatically_ELTPARAGRAPHE000327"></a>

To describe data files programmatically:

1. Declare the "**File Description**", "[Item Description](../WDLang4/1514071.md)", "[FullTextIndex Description](../WDLang4/1000017461.md)" and "[Link description](../WDLang4/1514039.md)" variables (if necessary).

2. For each data file:

	- Describe the characteristics of the data file using [HFSQL properties](../Proprietes/2512070.md).

	- Describe the characteristics of the items using [HFSQL properties](../Proprietes/2512070.md).

	- Validate the description of each item ([HDescribeItem](../WDLang4/3044233.md)).

	- If necessary, describe the characteristics of full-text indexes using [HFSQL properties](../Proprietes/2512070.md).

	- Validate the description of each full-text index ([HDescribeFullTextIndex](../WDLang4/1000017407.md)).

	- Validate the data file description ([HDescribeFile](../WDLang4/3044206.md)).




3. If necessary, describe the characteristics of the links using [HFSQL properties](../Proprietes/2512070.md).

4. If necessary, validate the description of each link ([HDescribeLink](../WDLang4/3044191.md)).

### Handling the items of a data file described programmatically
<a name="handling_the_items_data_file_described_programmatically_ELTPARAGRAPHE000380"></a>

When creating a data file in the data model editor, the names of the data files and items are automatically recognized by the compiler.

When creating a data file using a "File Description" variable, the names of the data file and its items can be defined with the [Name](../Proprietes/2510082.md) property. These names are not automatically recognized by the compiler. A compilation error occurs if these names are used to identify the data file or the items.

The name of the data file must be declared as data source using the [data source](../WDLang4/1514053.md) keyword, for the compiler to recognize this name. This data file can be handled by its name in the code editor.

For example:


```wl
AFile is File Description
...
AFile.Name = "CUSTOMER"
...
HDescribeFile("CUSTOMER")
...
CUSTOMER is Data Source
...
HReadFirst(CUSTOMER, "CUSTNAME")
```


**Remark**: The name of the data file can also be declared with the [Extern](../Motscles/1511013.md) keyword. However, the process execution will be slower.

### Logging
<a name="logging_ELTPARAGRAPHE000407"></a>

When the data file is described programmatically:

- if the data file is logged and if no item is logged, all the items (except for the composite keys) are automatically logged.

- if the data file is logged and if at least one item is logged, the other items are not modified.
