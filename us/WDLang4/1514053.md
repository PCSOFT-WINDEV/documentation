***In french: Data Source***
				



<a name="XUse"></a>
<a name="Use"></a>
<a name="description"></a>
A **Data source** variable is used to describe a temporary data source (query, view, alias, ... ). 
All the operations that can be performed on a view (or on a query) can be performed on a **Data source** variable associated with a view (or with a query).

**To describe a data source**, you must:

1. Declare a "Data source" variable.

2. Initialize the data source ([HExecuteSQLQuery](../WDLang4/3044084.md) or [HCreateView](../WDLang4/3044159.md)).
	The data source is automatically freed at the end of the process where this data source is declared. 
	**Remark**: The data source can also be initialized by [HDeclareExternal](../WDLang4/3044204.md). In this case, the data source allows you to handle a data file by using the description of this file, independently of the analysis. 




**Remarks**:

- When closing the application (or the process where the data source was declared), the data source will automatically be destroyed.

- A data source is always global to the HFSQL context in which it was declared.

- A data source may have an internal name other than the variable name, for example, to allow it to be used in an array. In the project description window ("Compilation" tab), you can define the ["Naming of data sources"](../Editeurs/9500218.md) option.

## Syntax

### Declaring one or more data sources

`<Name of variable> is Data Source
<Name of variable 1>, <Name of variable 2> are Data Sources
`
---

**`<Variable name>: ()`**

Name of "Data Source" variable to declare.

**Remark**: The <u><u><u><u>a</u></u></u></u> and <u><u><u><u>an</u></u></u></u> keywords are optional: they provide better readability. 


<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Declaring a data source by associating it with a data file or with a query

`<Name of variable> is Data Source <description=File or query name>`
---

**`<Variable name>: ()`**

Name of "Data Source" variable to declare.

**`<File or query name>: ()`**

Name of data file or query whose description must be associated with the data source. If this parameter is specified, the completion will propose the different items of the associated data source. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=SourceDeDonnees_Description.gif)





<a name="SYNTAX3"></a>

### Initializing a "Data source" variable (query or view)

``
---

**To initialize a "Data Source" variable**, use the following function:


- [HExecuteSQLQuery](../WDLang4/3044084.md) if the variable is associated with a query.

- [HCreateView](../WDLang4/3044159.md) if the variable is associated with a view.

- [HDeclareExternal](../WDLang4/3044204.md)if the variable must be associated with a physical file by importing the description of this file.





<a name="SYNTAX4"></a>

### Deleting the data source (query or view)

``
---

When the same Data Source variable is used several times with different data sources, the first data source must be freed.

**To free the memory space occupied by the data source (query or view)**, use the following function:


- [HCancelDeclaration](../WDLang4/3044174.md) if the variable is associated with a query.

- [HDeleteView](../WDLang4/3044091.md) if the variable is associated with a view.

## Remarks




### Handling a query or a view through programming
<a name="handling_query_view_through_programming_ELTPARAGRAPHE000161"></a>

To handle a query or a view by programming, we recommend that you use a "Data Source" variable.

However, you can specify a logical name when initializing the query or view. In that case, you will need to use the [Extern](../Motscles/1511013.md) keyword to directly manipulate the view or query in the code editor. This method can slow down the execution of your processes.

**Remark**: When using a logical name, the query or the view is not automatically destroyed: you must use [HCancelDeclaration](../WDLang4/3044174.md) and [HDeleteView](../WDLang4/3044091.md).

For example:

- **Initializing a query:**

	1. Initializing a query with a logical name:
			
		```wl
		Extern MyQuery
		HExecuteSQLQuery(MyQuery, "SELECT NAME FROM CUSTOMER")
		// Other possible syntax:
		// HExecuteSQLQuery("MyQuery", "SELECT NAME FROM CUSTOMER")
		 
		// Use the query
		HReadFirst(MyQuery, Name)
		IF NOT HOut() THEN
			Info("The 1st customer is: " + MyQuery.Name)
		END
		...
		HCancelDeclaration(MyQuery)
		```


	2. Initialize a query with a "Data source" variable:
			
		```wl
		MyQuery is Data Source
		HExecuteSQLQuery(MyQuery, "SELECT NAME FROM CUSTOMER")
		// Use the query
		HReadFirst(MyQuery, Name)
		IF NOT HOut() THEN
			Info("The 1st customer is: " + MyQuery.Name)
		END
		```








- **Initializing a view:**

	1. Initializing a view with a logical name:
			
		```wl
		Extern MyView
		HCreateView(MyView, CUSTOMER, "*", "NAME,CITY", "NAME]='A'", hViewDefault)
		// Other possible syntax:
		// HCreateView("MyView", "CUSTOMER", "*", "NAME,CITY", "NAME]='A'", hViewDefault)
		
		// Use the view
		HReadFirst(MyView, Name)
		IF NOT HOut() THEN
			Info("The 1st customer is: " + MyView.Name)
		END
		...
		HDeleteView(MyView)
		```


	2. Initializing a view with a "Data source" variable:
			
		```wl
		MyView is Data Source
		HCreateView(MyView, CUSTOMER, "*", "NAME,CITY", "NAME]='A'", hViewDefault)
		// Use the view
		HReadFirst(MyView, Name)
		IF NOT HOut() THEN
			Info("The 1st customer is: " + MyView.Name)
		END
		```









### Using a data source in an SQL query
<a name="using_data_source_sql_query_ELTPARAGRAPHE000199"></a>

To use a data source in the SQL code of a query, the SQL code of query must use the logical name assigned to the data source.

For example, the following code can be used regardless of the data source naming mode: 

```wl
ArchiveTicket is Data Source
HDeclareExternal("Ticket_Backup.FIC", ArchiveTicket)
     
QRY is Data Source 
sMyQry is string = [
	SELECT *
	FROM [%TicketArchive%]
	WHERE ZIPCODE='26110'
]

IF HExecuteSQLQuery(QRY, hQueryDefault, sMyQry) THEN
	Info(HNbRec(QRY) + " tickets match.")
END
```




Example of code to be used if the description of the external file is the description of one of the files in the analysis: 

```wl
ArchiveTicket is Data Source = <description=Ticket>
HDeclareExternal("Ticket.FIC", ArchiveTicket)
REQ is SQL Query = [
		SELECT *
		FROM [%TicketArchive%]
	]
HExecuteQuery(QRY)
FOR EACH QRY 
	Trace(QRY.TicketID)
END
```
