The following constants are used by the Mongoxxx functions:

| Constant | Details | Function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **mwcDefault** | Minimum number of nodes that must have acknowledged the process to consider that the writing is performed: a single node must have acknowledged the process to consider that the writing is performed. | [mongoWriteConcern](../WDLang4/1000022597.md) type |
| **mwcMajority** | Minimum number of nodes that must have acknowledged the process to consider that the writing is performed: most of the nodes must have acknowledged the process to consider that the writing is performed. | [mongoWriteConcern](../WDLang4/1000022597.md) type |
| **mwcUnacknowledged** | Minimum number of nodes that must have acknowledged the process to consider that the writing is performed: No node must have acknowledged the process to consider that the writing is performed. Caution, no error is returned in this case. | [mongoWriteConcern](../WDLang4/1000022597.md) type |
| **mwcTag** | Minimum number of nodes that must have acknowledged the process to consider that the writing is performed: the number of nodes is the one defined in a pre-configuration defined on the server. | [mongoWriteConcern](../WDLang4/1000022597.md) type |
| **mongoAddIfNotFound** | Used to add a document if it does not exist in the collection. | [MongoModifyAll](../WDLang4/1000022603.md)<br>[MongoModifyOne](../WDLang4/1000022443.md) |
| **mongoContinueIfError** | Used to add the next document even if the previous document triggered an error. | [MongoAdd](../WDLang4/1000022432.md) |
| **mongoReturnValueAfter** | Used to return the document after modification. By default, if this constant is not used, the document returned corresponds to the document before modification. | [MongoModifyOne](../WDLang4/1000022443.md) |
| **mongoWithoutValidation** | Does not check the document structure. | [MongoAdd](../WDLang4/1000022432.md)<br>[MongoModifyAll](../WDLang4/1000022603.md) |
