## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = <Connection>.RefreshView(<View> [, <Option>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the materialized view was refreshed, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if an error occurred. [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) is used to identify the error.




**`<Connection>: (Connection variable)`**

Name of the [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md) variable that describes the connection to use.

**`<View>: (Character string)`**

Name of materialized view whose data must be recalculated. This view was created: 

- via the data model editor. 

- via the SQL ["CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW"](../Editeurs/2034001.md) command.




**`<Option>: (Optional Integer constant)`**

Mode for refreshing the materialized view. 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hNoWait* | The refresh of materialized view is not a locking operation: it is performed in background task. [&lt;Connection variable&gt;.InfoView](../WDLang4/1000022688.md) returns the information of the materialized view after being refreshed. |
| Parameter not specified (by default) | The refresh of materialized view is locking for the one who requested it. &lt;Result&gt; is used to find out the status report of refresh. |

## Remarks


### Necessary rights
<a name="necessary_rights_ELTPARAGRAPHE000244"></a>

To recalculate the content of materialized view, you must have: 

- the corresponding rights (*hRightsManageTask* constant) on the server,

- for each relevant database (which means containing a view to process), the rights to connect (*hRightsConnection* or *hRightsEncryptedConnection* constant). 




To find out whether these rights are granted to a user or to a group, use [&lt;Connection variable&gt;.InfoServerRights](../WDLang4/1000022668.md) or [&lt;Connection variable&gt;.InfoDatabaseRights](../WDLang4/1000022666.md).

To modify the rights granted to a user or to a group of users, use [&lt;Connection variable&gt;.ModifyServerRights](../WDLang4/1000022710.md) or [&lt;Connection variable&gt;.ModifyDatabaseRights](../WDLang4/1000022707.md).
