## Syntax

`<Result> = HCancelAlias(<Alias file>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the operation was performed, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if a problem occurs. [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) is used to identify the error.

<a name="NOTE0_1"></a>

## Remarks
When cancelling an alias (**HCancelAlias**): 

- modifications made with [HChangeName](../WDLang4/3044141.md) and [HChangeDir](../WDLang4/3044168.md) are not cancelled. If the alias is described again, these parameters are stored and re-applied.

- if a data file has been created with a name given by [HChangeName](../WDLang4/3044141.md) and a location given by [HChangeDir](../WDLang4/3044168.md), the data file is not physically deleted. 

	- To delete a data file created from an alias, use [HDeleteFile](../WDLang4/3044294.md). 

	- To delete a folder created from an alias, use [HDeleteDirectory](../WDLang4/1000019001.md).
