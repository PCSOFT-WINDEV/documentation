---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the user was added, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if an error occurred. [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) is used to identify the error.




**`<Connection>: (Character string or Connection variable)`**

Connection for which a user must be added. This connection corresponds to: 

- the name of the connection defined in the data model editor or with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

## Remarks


### Rights required to add a user
<a name="rights_required_add_user_ELTPARAGRAPHE000116"></a>

To add a user, you must have the following rights:

- Rights to manage the users (*hRightsManageUser* constant).

- Rights to see the users (*hRightsSeeUser* constant).


These constants are used in [HInfoServerRights](../WDLang4/3044322.md) and [HModifyServerRights](../WDLang4/3044328.md).

### Rights management
<a name="rights_management_ELTPARAGRAPHE000136"></a>

No rights are granted by default to a new user (if this user is associated with no group).

If this user is associated with one or more groups, the rights associated with this group are granted to the user (the user "inherits" the rights associated with the group).

The following functions are used to grant rights to a user:

- [HModifyDatabaseRights](../WDLang4/3044326.md): is used to grant rights on a database.

- [HModifyFileRights](../WDLang4/3044327.md): is used to grant rights on a data file.

- [HModifyServerRights](../WDLang4/3044328.md): is used to grant rights on a server.


For more details, see [Managing the rights in HFSQL Client/Server](../WDLang4/3044333.md).

### "SuperUser" user
<a name="superuser_user_ELTPARAGRAPHE000164"></a>

If HUser.SuperUser = True, the user rights are not checked during an action. Therefore, all the actions can be performed by this user.
