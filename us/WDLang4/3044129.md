<a name="description"></a>
Sets the position on the last data file record whose value for a specific item is less than or equal to a sought value. ***The record is not read***.
The number of the current record is modified only when it is returned by [HRecNum](../WDLang4/3044063.md). For the functions that handle the current record number ([HDelete](../WDLang4/3044018.md), [HRead](../WDLang4/3044047.md), [HModify](../WDLang4/3044042.md), etc.), the value of this number is not updated: you must use [HRecNum](../WDLang4/3044063.md)(). For example: not to do: 

```wl
HDelete(Customer)
```
but 

```wl
HDelete(Customer, HRecNum())
```
Values in the browse item are read in ascending order (see Remarks for more details).

**Caution**: ***The record loaded in memory is not modified***. The HFSQL variables (Customer.Name for example, which means the *Name* item of *Customer* file) are not updated.

In most cases, **HSeekLast** sets the position in the data file to loop through the records that match a condition. [HNext](../WDLang4/3044027.md) is used to position on the next record corresponding to the condition.

Several cases may occur after the call to **HSeekLast**:

- a record corresponding to the condition was found: [HFound](../WDLang4/3044104.md) returns <u><u><u>True</u></u></u>

- the data file is empty or there is no record corresponding to the condition: [HOut](../WDLang4/3044094.md) returns <u><u><u>True</u></u></u>




**Remarks**: 

- By default, [HSeekFirst](../WDLang4/3044125.md) and [HSeekLast](../WDLang4/3044129.md) are used to perform an exact-match search.

- By default, **HSeekLast** performs a generic search.





The reading is performed from the lowest value to the greatest value of search item (see the notes for more details).

**Caution**: ***The record loaded in memory is not modified***. The HFSQL variables (Customer.Name for example, which means the *Name* item of *Customer* file) are not updated.

In most cases, **HSeekLast** sets the position in the data file to loop through the records that match a condition.

Several cases may occur after the call to **HSeekLast**:

- a record corresponding to the condition was found, locked (if necessary) and loaded in memory: [HFound](../WDLang4/3044104.md) returns <u><u><u>True</u></u></u>. 

- the data file is empty or there is no record corresponding to the condition: [HOut](../WDLang4/3044094.md) returns <u><u><u>True</u></u></u>.

- the function tries to lock a record that is already locked in read-only: [HErrorLock](../WDLang4/3044099.md) returns <u><u><u>True</u></u></u> and [HOut](../WDLang4/3044094.md) returns <u><u><u>True</u></u></u>.




**Remark**: the search can be canceled by [HCancelSeek](../WDLang4/3044157.md).

## Example


```wl
// Find the last record for which the Customer name is Moore
HSeekLast(Customer, Name, "Moore")
```
<a name="Example2"></a>

```wl
// This example is used to find all the customers 
// whose turnover is less than a specific value. 
HSeekLast(Customer, Turnover, X)
WHILE NOT HOut(Customer)
	AddCustomerList()
	HPrevious(Customer, Turnover)
END

## Syntax

`<Result> = HSeekLast(<Data file> , <Key item> , <Sought value> [, <Options>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the position was set on the record (corresponds to the value of [HFound](../WDLang4/3044104.md)). 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if a problem occurs. This problem can be caused by:

	- a positioning problem (empty data file, etc.): [HFound](../WDLang4/3044104.md) returns <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> and [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) returns 0.

	- an error: [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) returns an integer other than 0. [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) returns more details.







**`<Data file>: (Character string)`**

Name of the HFSQL data file used.

**`<Key item>: (Character string)`**

Name of key item on which the search will be performed.

**`<Sought value>: (Type corresponding to the value)`**

Value of the sought item.

**`<Options>: (Optional constant (or combination of constants))`**

Configures:

- the lock mode applied to the sought record

- the type of search performed.

![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Access by JDBC: This parameter is ignored.![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) The lock options will have no effect if the locks are not supported by the OLE DB provider or by the Native Connector.![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png) The lock mode specified by **HSeekLast** will remain effective during the calls to [HPrevious](../WDLang4/3044112.md) and [HNext](../WDLang4/3044027.md).

- [HSeekFirst](../WDLang4/3044125.md) or **HSeekLast**,

## Remarks


### Generic search/Exact-match search
<a name="generic_searchexactmatch_search_ELTPARAGRAPHE000279"></a>

- **Generic search** (mainly on the Character String items): ***Finds all records starting with the specified value***. 
	For example: When a generic search is performed on "Smith" (for the NAME item), all records whose Name item starts with "Smith" will match the search. Therefore, the record containing "Smither" will correspond to the search (**HFound** returns <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>).

- **Exact-match search**: ***Finds all records that exactly correspond to the specified value***. 
	For example: When an exact-match search is performed on "Smith" (for the NAME item), **HFound** returns <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> for the records whose item exactly matches "Smith".

| Moor | hGeneric | 5 | True | False | Moor does not exist but the search is generic, and Moore is found (among others).<br>The beginning of data file was not reached yet. |
| Moor |   | The record was not found (no move) | False | False | Moor does not exist.<br>The beginning of data file was not reached yet. |
| Bernard |   | The record was not found (no move) | False | True | Bernard does not exist.<br>Positioning on the first lower value (this value does not exist): The beginning of data file was reached. |

### Performing a search on a composite key
<a name="performing_search_composite_key_ELTPARAGRAPHE000380"></a>

Several methods can be used to perform a search on a composite key:

- Using a list of values.

- Calling [HBuildKeyValue](../WDLang4/3044258.md).




**Using a list of values**

The following syntax is used to perform a search on a composite key:


```txt
HSeekLast(<File name>, <Name of composite key>, ...
	[<Search value of first element of composite key>, 
	<Search value of first element of composite key>, ...])
```
Example:

```wl
// Find the record
HSeekLast(Customer, LastName_FirstName, ["Moore", "Vince"])
```
![Hyper File 5.5](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HF55.png) To perform generic searches on a composite key, all the components of composite key must be Text components. Otherwise, an exact-match search is performed.
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Search on an array item
<a name="search_array_item_ELTPARAGRAPHE000411"></a>

The search is performed on the first array element (element with index 1). To perform a search on the other array elements, use the filters or queries.
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Search and filter
<a name="search_and_filter_ELTPARAGRAPHE000420"></a>

If a filter is enabled ([HFilter](../WDLang4/3044100.md)), the search takes the filter into account.
![Hyper File 5.5](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HF55.png) If a filter is enabled, the filter is ignored by the search.

### Locks
<a name="locks_ELTPARAGRAPHE000437"></a>

The locks apply only when a record was found.

By default (no lock mode specified in &lt;Options&gt;), the record is not locked.

If a lock is requested (*hLockWrite* or *hLockReadWrite* constant), the record will be read only if this record is not already locked.

**Reminder**: A locked record can be unlocked by [HUnlockRecNum](../WDLang4/3044194.md).

![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) The lock options will have no effect if the locks are not supported by the OLE DB provider or by the Native Connector.
