Link functions are used to link the interface with the data files (and vice versa). These functions are: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [ControlToSource](../WDLang4/1000021384.md) | Assigns the control value to the source of a control link. |
| [FileToPage](../WDLang4/3044148.md) | Automatically updates the controls of a page with:<br><br>- the values of the bound items in the current record (loaded in memory) of the data file described in the data model editor. This operation is performed regardless of the state of the controls (grayed, inactive or invisible).<br><br>- the values of the bound WLanguage variables. This operation is performed regardless of the state of the controls (grayed, inactive or invisible).<br><br><br> |
| [FileToScreen](../WDLang4/3044210.md) | Automatically updates the controls in a window or page with:<br><br>- the values of the bound items in the current record (loaded in memory) of the data file described in the data model editor. <br><br>- the values of the bound WLanguage variables. <br><br><br>This operation is performed regardless of the state of the controls (grayed, inactive or invisible). |
| [PageFromSource](../WDLang4/1000021400.md) | Automatically updates the controls of a page with: <br><br>- the values of the bound items in the current record (loaded in memory) of the HFSL data file described in the data model editor. <br><br>- the values of the bound WLanguage variables. <br><br><br>This operation is performed regardless of the state of the controls (grayed, inactive or invisible). |
| [PageToFile](../WDLang4/3044022.md) | Automatically updates:<br><br>- the value of the items in a data file with the value of the controls in the page. The data file items bound to the window controls are automatically updated with the values of these controls.<br><br>- the value of the WLanguage variables with the value of the window controls. The WLanguage variables bound to the page controls are automatically updated with the values of these controls.<br><br><br>This operation is performed regardless of the state of the controls (grayed, inactive or invisible). |
| [PageToSource](../WDLang4/1000017406.md) | Automatically updates:<br><br>- the value of the items in a data file with the value of the controls in the page.<br><br>- the value of the WLanguage variables with the value of the page controls.<br><br><br> |
| [ScreenToFile](../WDLang4/3044146.md) | Automatically updates:<br><br>- the values of a data file's items in memory with the values from the controls in the window. <br><br>- the value of the WLanguage variables with the value of the window controls. <br><br><br>This function is also available for WEBDEV pages. |
| [ScreenToSource](../WDLang4/1000017342.md) | Automatically initializes: <br><br>- the values of a data file's items in memory with the values from the controls in the window.<br><br>- the value of the WLanguage variables with the value of the window controls.<br><br><br><br><br>This function is also available for WEBDEV pages. |
| [SourceFromPage](../WDLang4/1000021404.md) | Automatically updates:<br><br>- the value of the items in a data file with the value of the controls in the page.<br><br>- the value of the WLanguage variables with the value of the page controls.<br><br><br> |
| [SourceFromWindow](../WDLang4/1000021402.md) | Automatically updates: <br><br>- the values of a data file's items in memory with the values from the controls in the window.<br><br>- the value of the WLanguage variables with the value of the window controls.<br><br><br>This function is also available for WEBDEV pages. |
| [SourceToPage](../WDLang4/1000017405.md) | Automatically updates the controls of a page with: <br><br>- the values of the bound items in the current record (loaded in memory) of the HFSL data file described in the data model editor.<br><br>- the values of the bound WLanguage variables.<br><br><br> |
| [SourceToScreen](../WDLang4/1000017341.md) | Automatically updates the controls in a window or page with: <br><br>- the values of the bound items in the current record (loaded in memory) of the HFSL data file described in the data model editor.<br><br>- the values of the bound WLanguage variables. <br><br><br> |
| [WindowFromSource](../WDLang4/1000021396.md) | Automatically initializes the controls of a window with: <br><br>- the values of the bound items in the current record (loaded in memory) of the HFSL data file described in the data model editor.<br><br>- the values of the bound WLanguage variables. <br><br><br> |
