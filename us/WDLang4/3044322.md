## Syntax

`<Result> = HInfoServerRights(<Connection> , <User/Group> , <Rights> [, <Display mode>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Character string)`**



- Requested information, 

- Empty string ("") if an error occurred, 

- "Unknown user" or "Unknown group" if the current user has no permissions to see other users (*hRightsSeeUser* constant) and wants to get information about another user or group.




**In hDefault mode**, &lt;Result&gt; is a list of values separated by tabs. Each value in the list corresponds to the rights requested by &lt;Rights&gt;. The values in the list can correspond to one of the following constants:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hAllowed* | The relevant rights are granted to the user or group. |
| *hForbidden* | The relevant rights are not granted to the user or group. |
| *hInherit* | The user belongs to at least one group to which the relevant rights were granted.<br>This constant is returned only if the display mode is not set to *hEffective*. |


**In hDetails mode**, &lt;Result&gt; is a list of values with the following format:

```txt
<Relevant rights 1> + TAB + <Value of rights 1> + CR + ... 
<Relevant rights N> + TAB + <Value of rights N> + CR
```

The rights correspond to the constants used in the &lt;Rights&gt; parameters and the values of the rights correspond to the *hAllowed*, *hForbidden* or *hInherit* constants (see the above table).

**`<Connection>: (Character string or Connection variable)`**

Connection for which the rights of a user or group of users must be known. This connection corresponds to: 

- the name of the connection defined in the data model editor or with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

- the name of a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md).




**`<User/Group>: (Character string)`**

Name of the user or group whose rights must be known.

**`<Rights>: (Integer constant (or combination of constants))`**

List of rights to find:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hRightsAll* | List of all the rights.<br>We recommend that you use this constant in *hDetails* or *hEffective* + *hDetails* display mode. |
| *hRightsBackup* | Rights to perform a backup. You cannot use the *hRightsAll* constant with **HInfoServerRights** to get this information. Use *hRightsAll* with [HInfoDatabaseRights](../WDLang4/3044320.md). |
| *hRightsChangePassword* | Rights to change the password of a user on the server (the user can change his own password and the administrator can change the password of each user). |
| *hRightsChangeRights* | Rights to change the rights. |
| *hRightsCreateDB* | Rights to create a database. |
| *hRightsDisconnectClient* | Rights to disconnect the client computers. |
| *hRightsManageServer* | Rights to use [HSetServer](../WDLang4/3044359.md). |
| *hRightsManageTask* | Rights to manage the scheduled tasks. |
| *hRightsManageUser* | Rights to delete and add users or groups. |
| *hRightsPriority* | Rights to modify the priority of the current application ([HPriority](../WDLang4/3044352.md)) or the priority of another client application ([HPriorityClient](../WDLang4/3044353.md)). |
| *hRightsReadLogStat* | Rights to see the activity statistics and the logs of the server. |
| *hRightsSeeUser* | Rights to see the different users and groups. |
| *hRightsSendMessageToClient* | Rights to send messages to the client computers. |
| *hRightsServerReplication* | Rights to define and perform a replication between two HFSQL servers. |
| *hRightsStopServer* | Rights to stop a server ([HStopServer](../WDLang4/3044317.md)). |



**`<Display mode>: (Optional Integer constant)`**

Result display mode:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hDefault*<br>(Default value) | The rights returned do not take the inherited rights into account (rights granted to the groups to which the user belongs).<br>If no rights were defined, the value will be set to *hInherit*.<br>&lt;Result&gt; contains the values of the requested rights (in the same order). |
| *hDetails* | Same as *hDefault*.<br>&lt;Result&gt; contains the rights and there value. |
| *hEffective* | The rights returned correspond to the rights actually granted to the user or to the group on the server. The inherited rights are taken into account (rights granted to the groups to which the user belongs for example). |
| *hEffective + hDetails* | Same as *hEffective*. <br>&lt;Result&gt; contains the rights and there value. |
