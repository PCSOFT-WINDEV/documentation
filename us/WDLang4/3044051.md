<a name="description"></a>
Positions on the first file record according to a browse item. The record is read and the HFSQL variables are updated (Customer.Name for example, which means the *Name* item of *Customer* file).

Values in the browse item are read in ascending order (see [remarks](#NOTE0_1) for more details).

In most cases, **HReadFirst** is used to set the position in the data file in order to perform a read loop with [HReadNext](../WDLang4/3044037.md).

Several cases may occur after the call to **HReadFirst**:

- the data file is empty or no record corresponds to the filter (defined by [HFilter](../WDLang4/3044100.md)): no reading is performed and [HOut](../WDLang4/3044094.md) returns <u><u><u>True</u></u></u>.

- the function tries to read a record that is already locked in read mode: no read operation is performed, [HErrorLock](../WDLang4/3044099.md) returns <u><u><u>True</u></u></u> and [HOut](../WDLang4/3044094.md) returns <u><u><u>True</u></u></u>.
	
	![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Access by JDBC: The management of locks is not available for databases accessed by JDBC.




This function can be used with the data files, HFSQL views or queries.

## Syntax

`<Result> = HReadFirst([<Data file> [, <Browse item>] [, <Options>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**

Corresponds to: 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if an error occurred. In this case, [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) returns an integer other than 0. [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) returns more details about the error. The record is not read. 

- the value of [HFound](../WDLang4/3044104.md) in the other cases (the record can be read, even if &lt;Result&gt; returns <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>). 




**`<Data file>: (Optional character string)`**

Name of data file, HFSQL view or query used. If this parameter is an empty string (""), **HReadFirst** manipulates the last data file used by the last HFSQL function (function starting with "H").

**`<Browse item>: (Optional character string)`**

Name of item used to loop through the data file or view (this parameter is ignored by the queries). If this name is not specified, **HReadFirst** will use:

- ***For a data file***: the last browse item used on this file by the last function for HFSQL management (starting with the letter H). If this item does not exist, the best browse item is automatically used. 

- ***For a query***: the ORDER BY of query if it exists, otherwise the last item used. 

- ***For a view***: the sort item of the view (if it exists), otherwise the last item used.




**`<Options>: (Optional constant)`**

Used to configure:

- the lock set on the record read by **HReadFirst**

- whether the filter that was defined must be taken into account.

If possible, the query is not re-run. All the saved positions are stored. |





![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) The lock options will have no effect if the locks are not supported by the OLE DB provider or by the Native Connector.![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png) The lock mode specified by **HReadFirst** will remain effective during the calls to [HReadPrevious](../WDLang4/3044048.md) and [HReadNext](../WDLang4/3044037.md).

To modify the lock mode, you must use:

- [HReadSeekFirst](../WDLang4/3044036.md) or [HReadSeekLast](../WDLang4/3044034.md),

- [HReadLast](../WDLang4/3044140.md) or **HReadFirst**.

- [HLockRecNum](../WDLang4/3044152.md) or [HUnlockRecNum](../WDLang4/3044194.md).


![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) For Native Oracle Connector, a different lock mode can be specified for each record. However, if a transaction was started by [SQLTransaction](../WDLang4/3072029.md) before setting the lock, the lock will only be released at the end of the transaction ([SQLTransaction](../WDLang4/3072029.md) with the *sqlCommit* or *sqlRollBack* constant).![Hyper File 5.5](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HF55.png) The lock options are ignored. Use locking read functions (**HReadFirstLock**) kept for backward compatibility.![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Access by JDBC: The management of locks is not available for databases accessed by JDBC.

## Remarks


### Browse item
<a name="browse_item_ELTPARAGRAPHE000314"></a>

If the browse item is a key, **HReadFirst** reads the record with the lowest key value. The sort order is the one that was specified in the analysis for this key. If duplicates are found, **HReadFirst** reads the first "duplicate" record according to the sequence of record numbers.

If the browse item is not a key, **HReadFirst** reads the first active record. When browsing the file, the records will be sorted according to their record number. 
In this case, the selected browse item will appear in red in the code editor and a warning will be displayed in the ["Code" pane](../Editeurs/2027009.md).

**Remark**: The [automatic completion](../Editeurs/2013001.md) proposes the key items only.

### Browsing queries
<a name="browsing_queries_ELTPARAGRAPHE000343"></a>

By default, **HReadFirst** re-executes the query to refresh the result. To avoid re-executing the query, we recommend that you use the *hNoRefresh* constant.

**Browsing a query run with the hQueryWithoutCorrection constant**:

To browse the records in the order returned by the database, there is no need to specify a browse item. Example:

```wl
HExecuteQuery(MyQuery, hQueryWithoutCorrection)
...
HReadFirst(MyQuery, hNoRefresh)
```
If a browse item is specified, the query result is retrieved and indexed in its entirety. The iteration is performed on the specified item. The initial sort of the query (specified by ORDER BY) is ignored. The created index (in HFSQL format) is sensitive to the case, to the punctuation, to the accented characters and in ascending order.

Example:

```wl
HExecuteQuery(MyQuery, hQueryWithoutCorrection)
...
HReadFirst(MyQuery, MyItem, hNoRefresh)
```
The created index is used to perform searches on the query result.

### Locks
<a name="locks_ELTPARAGRAPHE000376"></a>

By default (&lt;Options&gt; not specified), the record is not locked.

If a lock is requested (*hLockWrite* or *hLockReadWrite* constant), the record will be read only if this record is not already locked.

![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) The lock options will have no effect if the locks are not supported by the OLE DB provider or by the Native Connector.
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Memos
<a name="memos_ELTPARAGRAPHE000391"></a>

The memos associated with the record can be automatically read (or not) when reading the record. [HSetMemo](../WDLang4/3044139.md) is used to customize this automatic read operation.

If the memos are supported, the associated text memos are read when the record is read. The binary memos are read only when they are explicitly used ([HExtractMemo](../WDLang4/3044072.md)).
<a name="NOTE0_5"></a>


### Password
<a name="password_ELTPARAGRAPHE000408"></a>

If **HReadFirst** is the first function that handles the specified data file, the password is checked when the opening data file. If the password is incorrect, [HErrorPassword](../WDLang4/3044082.md) returns <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> and [HOut](../WDLang4/3044094.md) returns <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>.
<a name="NOTE0_6"></a>
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png)![User code (UMC)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/MCU.png)![Stored procedures](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/PS.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) 

### Native XML Connector
<a name="native_xml_connector_ELTPARAGRAPHE000435"></a>

The behavior of **HReadFirst** depends on [HActivateAutoFilter](../WDLang4/3044297.md)/[HDeactivateAutoFilter](../WDLang4/3044298.md).

[HActivateAutoFilter](../WDLang4/3044297.md) is enabled by default.

Therefore, to read the content of XML file, read the content of main file (the parent) then read the content of linked files (the children).

When reading a data file, a filter is automatically applied to the linked data files in order to only read the records corresponding to the main file.

For example:
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=XML_2.GIF)
The email of this person can be retrieved when browsing the Person file.

To do so, simply set the position on the "Person" file and apply **HReadFirst** to the "Email" file.

In this case, the record read in the "Email" file will correspond to the first email associated with the current record in the "Person" file.

If this mechanism is disabled ([HDeactivateAutoFilter](../WDLang4/3044298.md)), the record read in the "Email" file will correspond to the first record found in the Email file (and not to the child of the record read in the "Person" file).
<a name="NOTE0_7"></a>


### Miscellaneous
<a name="miscellaneous_ELTPARAGRAPHE000475"></a>

- The current record number is returned by [HRecNum](../WDLang4/3044063.md).

- [HChangeKey](../WDLang4/3044151.md) is used to modify the search key while remaining positioned on the current record.

- To improve the first browse times on a file, use [HOptimize](../WDLang4/3044005.md) on this data file.

- This function replaces **HReadFirstLock** and **HReadFirstNoLock**, which were kept for compatibility with WINDEV 5.5.
