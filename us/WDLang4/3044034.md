<a name="description"></a>
Positions on the last record of a data file whose value for a specific item is less than or equal to a sought value (exact-match search). The record is read and the corresponding HFSQL variables are updated.

In most cases, **HReadSeekLast** sets the position in the data file to loop through the records that match a condition. [HReadPrevious](../WDLang4/3044048.md) is used to read the previous record corresponding to the condition.

Several cases may occur after the call to **HReadSeekLast**:

- a record corresponding to the condition was found, locked (if necessary) and loaded in memory: [HFound](../WDLang4/3044104.md) returns <u><u><u>True</u></u></u>.
	
	![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Access by JDBC: The management of locks is not available for databases accessed by JDBC.




- the data file is empty or there is no record corresponding to the condition: no reading is performed and [HOut](../WDLang4/3044094.md) returns <u><u><u>True</u></u></u>.




- the function tries to lock a record that is already locked in read-only: no read operation is performed, [HErrorLock](../WDLang4/3044099.md) is set to <u><u><u>True</u></u></u> and [HOut](../WDLang4/3044094.md) returns <u><u><u>True</u></u></u>.
	
	![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Access by JDBC: The management of locks is not available for databases accessed by JDBC.




This function can be used with the data files, HFSQL views or queries.

Remark: the search can be canceled by [HCancelSeek](../WDLang4/3044157.md).

## Syntax

`<Result> = HReadSeekLast(<Data file> , <Item> , <Sought value> [, <Options>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the record was found (corresponds to the value of [HFound](../WDLang4/3044104.md)). 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if a problem occurs. This problem can be caused by:

	- a positioning problem (empty data file, etc.): [HFound](../WDLang4/3044104.md) returns <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> and [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) returns 0.

	- an error: [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) returns an integer other than 0. [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) returns more details.







**`<Data file>: (Character string)`**

Name of data file, HFSQL view or query used.

**`<Item>: (Character string)`**

Name of item on which the search will be performed. This item can be a search key or not.
![Hyper File 5.5](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HF55.png) The search can only be performed on a key item.

**`<Sought value>: (Type corresponding to the value)`**

Value of the sought item.

**`<Options>: (Optional constant (or combination of constants))`**

Used to configure:

- the lock mode applied to the sought record.

- the type of search performed.

## Remarks


### Generic search/Exact-match search
<a name="generic_searchexactmatch_search_ELTPARAGRAPHE000353"></a>

- **Generic search** (mainly on the Character String items): ***Finds all records starting with the specified value***. 
	For example: When a generic search is performed on "Smith" (for the NAME item), all records whose Name item starts with "Smith" will match the search. Therefore, the record that contains "Smither" will match the search ([HFound](../WDLang4/3044104.md) returns <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>).
	**Remark**: For backward compatibility with version 5.5, the generic search of an empty string ("") is equivalent to the use of [HReadLast](../WDLang4/3044140.md).

- **Exact-match search**: ***Finds all records that exactly correspond to the specified value***. 
	For example: When an exact-match search is performed on "Smith" (for the NAME item), [HFound](../WDLang4/3044104.md) returns <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> for the records whose item exactly matches "Smith".

- **Examples of searches on the CUSTOMER data file sorted by name:**

| Sought value | Options | **HReadSeekLast** positions on the record. | **HFound** returns | **HOut** returns | Explanations |
| Davon |   | 6 | True | False | Davon exists.<br>The beginning of data file was not reached yet. |
| Davo |   | 5 | False | False | Davo does not exist. Positioning on the first lower value (Moore).<br>The beginning of data file was not reached yet. |
| Moor | hGeneric | 5 | True | False | Moor does not exist but the search is generic, and Moore is found (among others).<br>The beginning of data file was not reached yet. |
| Moor |   | The record was not found (no move). | False | False | Moor does not exist.<br>The beginning of data file was not reached yet. |
| Bernard |   | The record was not found (no move). | False | True | Bernard does not exist.<br>Positioning on the first lower value (this value does not exist): the beginning of data file was reached. |

### Search performed on a key item or on a non-key item
<a name="search_performed_key_item_nonkey_item_ELTPARAGRAPHE000466"></a>

The search can be performed on a key item or a non-key item.

If the search is performed on a key item:

- the search is fast and the result is sorted.

- if the iteration is continued by [HReadPrevious](../WDLang4/3044048.md), the next records will correspond to the values less than or equal to the search value. In this case, [HOut](../WDLang4/3044094.md) must be checked after each read operation to find out whether the beginning of the file has been reached.




If the search is performed on a non-key item:

- the selected item will appear in red in the code editor and a warning will appear in the ["Compilation error" pane](../Editeurs/2027031.md).
	**Remark**: The [automatic completion](../Editeurs/2013001.md) proposes the key items only.

- if the iteration is continued by [HReadPrevious](../WDLang4/3044048.md), the next records will correspond to the values equal to the search value.



<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Performing a search on a composite key
<a name="performing_search_composite_key_ELTPARAGRAPHE000502"></a>

Several methods can be used to perform a search on a composite key:

- Using a list of values.

- Calling [HBuildKeyValue](../WDLang4/3044258.md).




**1. Using a list of values**

The following syntax is used to perform a search on a composite key:


```txt
HReadSeekLast(<File name>, <Name of composite key>, 
	[<Search value of first element of composite key>, 
	<Search value of first element of composite key>, ...])
```
Example:

```wl
// Find the record
HReadSeekLast(CUSTOMER, LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME, ["MOORE","Vince"])
```

**2. Using [HBuildKeyValue](../WDLang4/3044258.md)**

Example:

```wl
bufSoughtVal is Buffer = HBuildKeyValue(CUSTOMER, LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME, sLastName, sFirstName)
HReadSeekLast(CUSTOMER, LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME, bufSoughtVal)
WHILE HFound(CUSTOMER)
	HDelete(CUSTOMER)
	HPrevious(CUSTOMER, LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME)
END
```
![Hyper File 5.5](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HF55.png) To perform generic searches on a composite key, all the components of composite key must be Text components. Otherwise, an exact-match search is performed.
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Search and filter
<a name="search_and_filter_ELTPARAGRAPHE000546"></a>

If a filter is enabled ([HFilter](../WDLang4/3044100.md)), the filter is taken into account by the search only if the key used is identical.

To apply this filter in the rest of the iteration (even if the search key is not optimized for the filter), use the *hKeepFilter* constant.
![Hyper File 5.5](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HF55.png) If a filter is enabled, the filter is ignored by the search.
<a name="NOTE0_5"></a>


### Search on an array item
<a name="search_array_item_ELTPARAGRAPHE000563"></a>

The search is performed on the first array element (element with index 1). To perform a search on the other array elements, use the filters or queries.
<a name="NOTE0_6"></a>


### Looping through records that match a condition
<a name="looping_through_records_that_match_condition_ELTPARAGRAPHE000572"></a>

In most cases, **HReadSeekLast** sets the position in the data file to loop through the records that match a condition. [HReadNext](../WDLang4/3044037.md) and [HReadPrevious](../WDLang4/3044048.md) are used to read the next and previous matching records.

To ignore the search while going to the next or previous record, use one of the following functions:

- [HCancelSeek](../WDLang4/3044157.md)

- [HReadLast](../WDLang4/3044140.md)

- [HReadFirst](../WDLang4/3044051.md)

### Exact-match search in Access
<a name="exactmatch_search_access_ELTPARAGRAPHE000600"></a>

To perform an exact-match search on an ACCESS database, it is recommended to use [NoSpace](../WDLang1/3024034.md) if there are space characters at the end of the sought value.

### Locks
<a name="locks_ELTPARAGRAPHE000614"></a>

The locks apply only when a record was found.

By default (no lock mode specified in &lt;Options&gt;), the record is not locked.

If a lock is erquested (*hLockWrite* or *hLockReadWrite* constant), the record will be read only if this record is not already locked.

Reminder: A locked record can be unlocked by [HUnlockRecNum](../WDLang4/3044194.md).

![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) Lock options will have no effect if the OLE DB provider or Native Connector (also called Native Access) does not support locks.
<a name="NOTE0_9"></a>
