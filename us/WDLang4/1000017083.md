Returns information about one or more backups performed on an HFSQL Client/Server server.

The backups have been performed by [HBackup](../WDLang4/1000017081.md) (or via the HFSQL Control Center) and they can be restored by [HRestoreBackup](../WDLang4/1000017230.md) (or via the HFSQL Control Center).

## Example


```wl
// Displays information about the backups in a Table control
sReport is string = HInfoBackup(gctConnection)
sLine is string
FOR EACH STRING sLine OF sReport SEPARATED BY EOT
	IF sLine ~="" THEN CONTINUE
	TableAdd(TABLE_Backups)
	nSub is int = TableCount(TABLE_Backups)
	TABLE_Backups.COL_BackupID[nSub] = ExtractString(sLine, 1)
	TABLE_Backups.COL_DateTime[nSub] = ExtractString(sLine, 2)
	TABLE_Backups.COL_Filter[nSub] = ExtractString(sLine, 3)
	TABLE_Backups.COL_Name[nSub] = ExtractString(sLine, 4)
	TABLE_Backups.COL_Description[nSub] = ExtractString(sLine, 5)
	TABLE_Backups.COL_Status[nSub] =  ...
			SWITCH(Val(ExtractString(sLine, 6)) + 1, ...
				"In progress", "Performed", "Canceled", "Error")
	TABLE_Backups.COL_PerThousand[nSub] = ExtractString(sLine, 7)
END

## Syntax

### Information about the backups performed on the server

`<Result> = HInfoBackup(<Connection>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Character string)`**

Description of backups performed on the specified server. This description has the following format: 

```txt
<Identifier of Backup 1> + TAB + <Date of Backup 1> + TAB + 
<Files Saved> + TAB + <Destination Path of Backup 1> + TAB + 
<Description> + TAB + <Status> + TAB + <Per Thousand> + TAB + <Error Message> + TAB + 
<Type> + TAB + <Identifier of Full Backup> + TAB + <With Index> + TAB + 
<Compression> + EOT
```
 where:

- &lt;Files Saved&gt; is the list of data saved separated by semicolons (";"). 
	&lt;Status&gt; corresponds to an integer (or to an Integer constant) used to find out the backup status:
	


|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *hBackupCanceled* | 2 | Backup canceled |
| *hBackupCompleted* | 1 | Backup completed |
| *hBackupError* | 3 | Error during backup |
| *hBackupInProgress* | 0 | Backup in progress |



- &lt;Per Thousand&gt; corresponds to the rate of backup completion if the backup is in progress (expressed in per thousand).

- &lt;Error Message&gt; is the error message if the backup failed.

- &lt;Type&gt; corresponds to an integer (or to an Integer constant) used to find out the type of backup: 
	


|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *hBackupDifferential* | 1 | Differential backup |
| *hBackupFull* | 0 | Full backup |



- &lt;Identifier of Full Backup&gt; corresponds to the identifier of the corresponding full backup in case of differential backup.

- &lt;With Index&gt;: Used to find out whether the backup contains the indexes: 

	- 0 if the backup of indexes was not performed,

	- 1 if the backup of indexes was performed. 




- &lt;Compression&gt;: Constant corresponding to the backup compression:

	- *zipFormatNone*: the backup is not compressed.

	- *zipFormatZip*: the backup is compressed. 





Remark: the separator used between the different descriptions is "EOT" (instead of "CR") because the different description parameters can contain Carriage Return characters (CR). 

**`<Connection>: (Character string or Connection variable)`**

Connection to the server whose backups will be listed. This connection corresponds to: 

- the name of the connection defined in the data model editor or with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

- the name of a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md).

### Information about a specific backup

`<Result> = HInfoBackup(<Connection> , <Backup identifier>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Character string)`**

Description of specified backup on the specified server. This description has the following format:

```txt
<Identifier of Backup 1> + TAB + <Date of Backup 1> + TAB + 
<Files Saved> + TAB + <Destination Path of Backup 1> + TAB + 
<Description> + TAB + <Status> + TAB + <Per Thousand> + TAB + <Error Message> + TAB + 
<Type> + TAB + <Identifier of Full Backup> + TAB + <With Index> + TAB + 
<Compression> + EOT
```

 where:

- &lt;Files Saved&gt; is the list of data saved separated by semicolons (";"). 
	&lt;Status&gt; corresponds to an integer (or to an Integer constant) used to find out the backup status:
	


|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *hBackupCanceled* | 2 | Backup canceled |
| *hBackupCompleted* | 1 | Backup completed |
| *hBackupError* | 3 | Error during backup |
| *hBackupInProgress* | 0 | Backup in progress |



- &lt;Per Thousand&gt; corresponds to the rate of backup completion if the backup is in progress (expressed in per thousand).

- &lt;Error Message&gt; is the error message if the backup failed.
	&lt;Type&gt; corresponds to an integer (or to an Integer constant) used to find out the type of backup:
	


|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *hBackupDifferential* | 1 | Differential backup |

	- 1 if the backup of indexes was performed. 




- &lt;Compression&gt;: Constant corresponding to the backup compression: 

	- *zipFormatNone*: the backup is not compressed.

	- *zipFormatZip*: the backup is compressed. 





Remark: the separator used between the different descriptions is "EOT" (instead of "CR") because the different description parameters can contain Carriage Return characters (CR). 

**`<Connection>: (Character string or Connection variable)`**

Connection to the server that performed the backup. This connection corresponds to: 

- the name of the connection defined in the data model editor or with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

- the name of a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md).




**`<Backup identifier>: (Integer)`**

Identifier of backup whose characteristics are requested. This identifier is returned by [HBackup](../WDLang4/1000017081.md).

## Remarks


### Miscellaneous
<a name="miscellaneous_ELTPARAGRAPHE000277"></a>

- **HInfoBackup** is used to list the tasks performed or the current tasks. The scheduled tasks that have not been performed are not listed.

- The backups performed by the HFSQL Control Center and the ones performed by programming are listed.

- The dates and times are expressed in universal time (UTC).



<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Necessary rights
<a name="necessary_rights_ELTPARAGRAPHE000292"></a>

To get in formation about a backup, the user or the group must have: 

- for each database affected by the backup, the rights to perform backups (*hRightsBackup* constant) or the rights to connect (*hRightsConnection* or *hRightsEncryptedConnection* constant). 

- for a full server backup, the rights to perform backups (*hRightsBackup* constant) on the server. 




To find out whether these rights are granted to a user or to a group, use [HInfoServerRights](../WDLang4/3044322.md) or [HInfoDatabaseRights](../WDLang4/3044320.md).

To modify the rights granted to a user or to a group of users, use [HModifyServerRights](../WDLang4/3044328.md) or [HModifyDatabaseRights](../WDLang4/3044326.md).
