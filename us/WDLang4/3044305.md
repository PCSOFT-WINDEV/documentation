## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000150"></a>
**If you modify an existing WINDEV application into an HFSQL Client/Server application**, two methods can be used to convert the HFSQL Classic files into HFSQL Client/Server files: from the data model editor or from the HFSQL Control Center.
For more details on how to convert HFSQL Classic files to Client/Server, see [Converting an HFSQL Classic database into HFSQL Client/Server](../WDLang4/9000155.md). 

No specific operation is required **to create an HFSQL Client/Server application**. The data files will be created on the server during the call to [HCreation](../WDLang4/3044255.md) or [HCreationIfNotFound](../WDLang4/3044254.md).

### Names on a Linux server
<a name="names_linux_server_ELTPARAGRAPHE000033"></a>

On a Linux server, the names of data files must be written in lowercase with no accented characters.

Therefore, the file named "Tasks.fic" must be renamed to "tasks.fic". [HCopyFile](../WDLang4/3044282.md) is used to copy the data files while taking into account the specific features regarding the case of file names in Linux.

### Important
<a name="important_ELTPARAGRAPHE000045"></a>

In HFSQL Client/Server:

- [HSubstDir](../WDLang4/3044028.md) is ignored. Indeed, this function can only be used to substitute the directories of the HFSQL Network files.

- If [HChangeDir](../WDLang4/3044168.md) is used, you must specify a path relative to the directory of the application database on the server. This operating mode allows you to be independent of the location of the server used.

- If a directory path is specified in the analysis description, in the description of the data files found in the analysis or in the project description, this path must be relative to the directory of the application database on the server.

- The data files accessed by an HFSQL server are accessible via this server only. They cannot be directly accessed by another application especially via the HFSQL Classic engine. A connection to the server is required to access these data files.

### Managing the integrity constraints
<a name="managing_the_integrity_constraints_ELTPARAGRAPHE000062"></a>

If an HFSQL ISAM application was modified into an HFSQL Client/Server application by creating the data files on the server, the integrity constraints are supported.

If an HFSQL ISAM application was modified into an HFSQL Client/Server application without creating the HFSQL data files on the server (by simple copy), the integrity constraints are not managed.

Several methods can be used to **manage the integrity constraints in your HFSQL application**:

- Use the [HAddLink](../WDLang4/3044312.md) function. 

- Perform the automatic modification of the data files when installing the application. The automatic modification of the data files is used to create the integrity constraints on the server.

## Importing the structures
<a name="importing_the_structures_ELTTEXTE000216"></a>
The structures of the files found on an existing HFSQL server can be imported into an analysis: on the "Analysis" tab, in the "Creation" group, expand "Import" and select "Import file/table descriptions...".

## Limitations
<a name="limitations_ELTTEXTE000240"></a>
The management mode of data files may have to be adapted when using an HFSQL Client/Server application. To learn more about the specific features to be taken into account, see [Differences and limitations specific to an HFSQL Client/Server application](../WDLang4/3044302.md).
