## Version 19: HyperFileSQL and HFSQL
<a name="version_19_hyperfilesql_and_hfsql_ELTTEXTE000051"></a>
HFSQL is the new name of HyperFileSQL. 

What an evolution since the first version in 1989!

To simplify its name, the database becomes HFSQL, a name already used by many developers and database managers.

HFSQL and HyperFileSQL are fully compatible, in Classic, network, Client/Server, cloud, embedded modes.

Let's remember that HFSQL is the only database in the world compatible in Windows, Linux, iOS, MacOS, Android, regardless of the use mode: Classic, mobile, Cloud, Client/Server.

To move a database from a Windows server to Android (for example), all you have to do is copy the database and its indexes, and everything is operating straightaway!
