<a name="Use"></a>
<a name="description"></a>
Opens a connection to a specific database. The connection remains opened until the call to [HCloseConnection](../WDLang4/3044095.md). **HOpenConnection** is used to:

- open a preset connection.

- define and open a connection. Then, this connection must be assigned to a data file with [HChangeConnection](../WDLang4/3044150.md).

- define and open a connection by using a connection string. This syntax can be used with some OLE DB providers who have specific ADO connecting strings.
	
	![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Access by JDBC: This option is not available.

- open a connection defined by a [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md) variable.


**Caution**: The order in which the functions for connecting to an HFSQL Client/Server database are called is important. For more details, see [Optimizing the connection times to the HFSQL Client/Server databases](../WDLang4/9000176.md).

## Syntax

### Opening a preset connection

`<Result> = HOpenConnection(<Connection>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the operation was performed, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if a problem occurred (during a connection described through programming, some parameters used in [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) may be incorrect for example).




[HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) is used to identify the error.

**`<Connection>: (Character string or Connection variable)`**

Connection to a database. This connection corresponds to: 

- the name of the connection defined in the data model editor,

- the name of the connection defined by [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md). The connection description must be known when running the function.

- the name of a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md). 





<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Defining and opening a connection

---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the operation was performed, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if a problem occurs. [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) is used to identify the error. To assign this connection to a file, use [HChangeConnection](../WDLang4/3044150.md). The connection description will be deleted when closing the connection.




**`<New connection>: (Character string or Connection variable)`**

Name of new connection to define and to open. This name must not be used by another connection (defined in the analysis, or by **HOpenConnection** or [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md)).

This parameter corresponds to the [Name](../Proprietes/2510082.md) property used on a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md).

**`<User>: (Character string)`**

Username used for the database. This parameter can be modified and retrieved using the [User](../Proprietes/2512107.md) property on a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md).

**`<Password>: (Optional character string)`**

Connection password (if this password exists). If no password is required, use an empty string ("") or the NULL keyword. This parameter can be modified using the [Password](../Proprietes/2510086.md) property on a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md).

**`<Data source>: (Character string)`**

Full path of the data source. The connection will be created and opened for this data source.

This parameter can be retrieved and modified using the [Source](../Proprietes/2510147.md) property (or [Server](../Proprietes/2512105.md)) on a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md).
![HFSQL Client/Server](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HFCS.png) This parameter corresponds to the server name. The port number used by the HFSQL server can be specified. The port 4900 will be used by default. If the port number of the HFSQL server is different, use the following notation: 
&lt;Computer name&gt;: &lt;Port number&gt; 
Example: "ComputerName:4901". 
For a use via Internet, the ports must be managed by Firewall. For more details, see [Managing ports](../WDLang4/3044334.md). 
You have the ability to specify an IPv6 address by writing the IPv6 address between square brackets. In this case, the port number must be specified after the closing square bracket. For example: [0154:2145:2155::5554]:4900. ![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Access by JDBC: 

- This parameter must correspond to URL of the connection to the database. This URL is specific to each driver.

- Depending on the JDBC driver used, the database name must be specified in the connection URL.




**`<Database>: (Optional character string)`**

Name of database that will be used on the data source. If this parameter is not required, use an empty string ("").

This parameter can be retrieved and modified using the [Database](../Proprietes/2512101.md) property on a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md).

In the case of a database divided into schemas, the name of the schema in the database will be specified by [HChangeName](../WDLang4/3044141.md).

This database will be automatically created if it does not exist.

![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) DB2: This parameter is not required.

**`<OLE DB provider or Native Connector>: (Character string or constant)`**

This keyword can take two values:<br><br>- FAST<br><br>- RC5_16 to use 16-round RC5 encryption.<br><br>- AES128 to use 128-bit AES encryption with the OFB mode of operation.<br><br>- AES192 to use 192-bit AES encryption with the OFB mode of operation.<br><br>- AES256 to use 256-bit AES encryption with the OFB mode of operation.<br><br><br> |


This parameter can be retrieved and modified using the [ExtendedInfo](../Proprietes/2512041.md) property.![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) HFSQL database accessed via a RMI server: This parameter corresponds to the address of RMI server and to the port used. The following format must be used: "RMI=&lt;Server address&gt;:&lt;Port number&gt;". For example: "RMI=192.168.52.148:1099".![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Access by JDBC: This parameter is mandatory. It must correspond to the full name of JDBC driver to use. This name is case sensitive.

**`<Additional options>: (Optional constant)`**

If this parameter is not specified, the HFSQL engine automatically defines the best parameters to use according to the database accessed and to the OLE DB provider used. 

By default, this parameter corresponds to the following combination of constants: 

*hServerCursor* + *hOpenKeysetCursor* + *hOptimisticCursor* 

However, these parameters can differ according to the information returned by the database.

To force some parameters, you have the ability to combine the following constants:

- **Location of cursors**
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hClientCursor* | Cursor managed by MDAC. Offers more features than a server cursor. A client cursor must necessarily be a static cursor. |
| *hServerCursor* | Cursor managed by the database. This cursor can easily apply the changes performed by the other users to the data. |



- **Type of cursor**
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hDynamicCursor* | Cursor offering a lot of features but consuming a lot of memory. This cursor allows all types of moves. It allows you to access all the modifications, additions and deletions performed by the other users. |
| *hForwardOnlyCursor* | Fast cursor consuming little memory. The move is performed from the first record to the last one. The data modified by the other users is not visible. |
| *hOpenKeysetCursor* | Cursor that handles a fixed set of records. Only the keys corresponding to the record are stored and not the records (consumes less memory). The deleted records can no longer be accessed. Modifications performed by other users are visible (but records added are not). |
| *hStaticCursor* | Makes a copy of all query records in memory (high memory usage). All types of moves are allowed. |



- **Lock mode**
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hOptimisticCursor* | The record is locked when it is updated |
| *hPessimisticCursor* | The record is locked as soon as it goes into edit mode to be modified. |
| *hReadOnlyCursor* | The set of records cannot be modified. |




Caution: some types of cursors may not be supported by all the OLE DB providers.

This parameter can be retrieved and modified using the [CursorOptions](../Proprietes/2512103.md) property.

### Syntax 1: Opening a preset connection: automatic management of connections
<a name="syntax_1_opening_preset_connection_automatic_management_connections_ELTPARAGRAPHE000741"></a>

- The connection associated with a data file is automatically opened when the data file is opened. The connection is closed when the last data file that uses this connection is closed.

- Any connection opened by **HOpenConnection** remains open even if no data file uses it.

- If the application opens and closes data files many times in a row, the automatic management of connections will open/close connections many times, slowing down the application. In this case, it is recommended to use **HOpenConnection** to keep the connection open.

### Syntax 2: Using a character string for the OLE DB provider
<a name="syntax_2_using_character_string_for_the_ole_provider_ELTPARAGRAPHE000758"></a>

To easily find the character string that must be used to define the OLE DB provider, we recommend that you proceed as follows:

1. In the analysis editor, create an HFSQL Client/Server connection, for example. 

2. In the connection description screen, select the provider to be used (in "Connection by").

3. The character string corresponding to the provider is displayed. This character string can be used in the syntax 2 instead of constants.

### Pseudo-connection to HFSQL Classic database
<a name="pseudoconnection_hfsql_classic_database_ELTPARAGRAPHE000788"></a>

OLE DB data files or native data files are described in the data model editor. To handle these descriptions with an HFSQL Classic database, simply specify the ***hAccessHF7*** constant as provider name.

The data files in HFSQL Classic format corresponding to the description of the OLE DB or native files will be created (if necessary) in the directory defined by &lt;Data source&gt;.
<a name="NOTE0_5"></a>


### Differences between HOpenConnection and HDescribeConnection
<a name="differences_between_docparampagetitleshort_and_hdescribeconnection_ELTPARAGRAPHE000797"></a>

**Method 1**: To open a connection at the start of the application and close it at the end, use [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md). To use this connection when handling data files or tables, simply change this connection with [HChangeConnection](../WDLang4/3044150.md).


```wl
HOpenConnection(MyConnection, params) // Open the connection 
HChangeConnection(AFile, MyConnection)
```
**Method 2**: To describe a connection through programming and to automatically open it when the file is opened, you must:

- describe the connection with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md)

- associate this connection with the desired data file description using [HChangeConnection](../WDLang4/3044150.md). The connection will only be opened the first time the data file is accessed.




This solution can be useful when an application handles both HFSQL data files and Oracle data files. For example, if the application uses a single Oracle file, in a specific process, the connection to the Oracle database will only be made if necessary.

If the first solution is chosen for the same type of application, the connection (that may take quite a long time) will be established whenever the application is started.

Example:


```wl
HDescribeConnection(MyConnection, params) 
HChangeConnection(AFile, MyConnection) 
... 
HReadFirst(AFile) // Open the connection 
... 
HClose(AFile) // Close the connection
```

### UDL file (file for describing an OLE DB connection)
<a name="udl_file_file_for_describing_ole_connection_ELTPARAGRAPHE000835"></a>

To create a UDL file:

1. Create a text file whose extension is "UDL".

2. Double-click this file. The window for the properties of the data links is opened.

3. Configure the connection.

4. Run the test of the connection.

5. Validate ("OK" button). The UDL file can now be used.

### Native Oracle Connector: managing the external authentication
<a name="native_oracle_connector_managing_the_external_authentication_ELTPARAGRAPHE000854"></a>

To connect via an external authentication, the following connection parameters must be used: 

- &lt;Username&gt; = / (slash)

- &lt;Password&gt; = "" (empty string)




Remark: The external authentication consists in using the name of Windows user and his password to connect to the database. The external authentication requires configuring the server. See the Oracle documentation to learn more about how to authorize external authentications on the server.
