Unlocks the records of a data file:

- locked by [HLockFile](../WDLang4/3044153.md).

- individually locked by a locking read function.




The data file can also be unlocked by closing it ([HClose](../WDLang4/3044073.md)).

Remark: **HUnlockFile** cannot be used to unlock a data file locked by another session or program. We advise you to unlock a data file as soon as possible in order for the other sessions to be able to access this data file.
![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This function can be used with HFSQL Client/Server data files.

## Syntax

`<Result> = HUnlockFile([<Data file>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the data file was unlocked, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if a problem occurred (the data file is not locked, ...). [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) is used to identify the error.




**`<Data file>: (Optional character string)`**

Name of the data file used. 
If this name is not specified, **HUnlockFile** will use the last data file used by the last HFSQL function (function starting with "H").

- the data file is not locked.

- the data file was locked by another program.
