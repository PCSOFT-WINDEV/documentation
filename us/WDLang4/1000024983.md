Creates an HFSQL view from two views created beforehand ([&lt;Source&gt;.CreateView](../WDLang4/1000024209.md)). Several operations can be performed when merging the views.

<a name="Example1"></a>
<a name="sample_code"></a>

## Example


```wl
// Merge two views
MyView is Data Source
ViewCustomer84 is Data Source
...
MyView.MergeView(ViewCustomer84, ViewCustomer84, hViewUnion, "+CustName")
```

## Syntax

`<Result> = <Source>.MergeView(<First view> , <Second view> , <Type of operation> , <Sort item of first view> [, <Sort item of second view> [, <Creation mode> [, <Page size>]]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the view was created,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if a problem occurs. [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) is used to identify the error.




**`<Source>: (Type of Source)`**

Name of view to create, result of operation performed on the two specified views.

**`<First view>: (Character string)`**

Name of first view included in the operation.

**`<Second view>: (Character string)`**

Name of second view included in the operation.

**`<Type of operation>: (Integer constant)`**

Operation that will be performed between the two specified views:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hViewIntersection* | Rows common to &lt;First view&gt; and to &lt;Second view&gt;. |
| *hViewJoin* | Join between the first view and the second view. |
| *hViewSubtraction* | Rows of &lt;First view&gt; without the common rows of &lt;Second view&gt;. |
| *hViewUnion* | Combination of all rows of &lt;First view&gt; and &lt;Second view&gt;. <br>The structure of views must be identical. |
| *hViewUnionEx* | Combination of all non-common rows of &lt;First view&gt; and &lt;Second view&gt;. <br>The structure of views must be identical. |
<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Vueensem.gif)


**`<Sort item of first view>: (Character string)`**

Name of the item that will be used on the first view to perform the operation. This item will also be used to sort the destination view.

**`<Sort item of second view>: (Optional character string)`**

Name of the item that will be used on the second view to perform the operation. If this parameter is not specified, it is equal to the value of &lt;Sort item of first view&gt;.

**`<Creation mode>: (Optional Integer constant (or combination of constants))`**

Configures the creation mode of view.


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hViewAdd* | Stores the content of the view next time [&lt;Source&gt;.ExecuteView](../WDLang4/1000024949.md) is called. |
| *hViewBreakable* | The view creation can be interrupted by pressing the ESC key. |
| *hViewDefault* | Default creation mode of view. |
| *hViewDistinct* | The view is created without duplicates according to the sort key. |
| *hViewExclusive* | Optimizes the creation time of view by locking the entire source data file. |
| *hViewLocking* | The records read in the data file and included in the view are locked.<br> |
| *hViewPostponed* | The view is created but it will be run later by [&lt;Source&gt;.ExecuteView](../WDLang4/1000024949.md). |



**`<Page size>: (Optional integer)`**

Number of records per page (for a view used by remote access).

## Remarks


### Influence of sort items
<a name="influence_sort_items_ELTPARAGRAPHE000325"></a>

The sort items are used to define the items on which the requested operation will be performed. Therefore, an intersection operation will return all the records of the first view for which &lt;Sort item of first view&gt; is equal to &lt;Sort item of second view&gt; for at least one record of the second view.
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Handling the view items after a join
<a name="handling_the_view_items_after_join_ELTPARAGRAPHE000335"></a>

The items issued from a join are named as follows:

- if the item name exists in only one of the source views, this item name is kept in the join.

- if the item name exists in both source views, the item of the join corresponding to the item of the second view is renamed "*NameView2_ItemName*".




The following syntax also allows you to access the items found in the join:


```txt
<Name of source view>_<Item name>
```
Examples:

- The View1 named "CustomerView" contains the items: CustomerID, OrderID, Name.

- The View2 named "OrderView" contains the items: OrderID, Name, Product.

- The join named "CustomerOrder" is created from the views named "CustomerView" and "OrderView" on the "OrderID" item. The "CustomerOrder" view contains the following items: CustomerID, OrderID, Name, OrderView_Name, Product.
	

| Accessing the item: | Syntax used |
| --- | --- |
| CustomerID | CustomerOrder.CustomerID <br>or <br>CustomerOrder.CustomerView_CustomerID |
| OrderID | CustomerOrder.OrderID<br>or <br>CustomerOrder.CustomerView_OrderID<br>or <br>CustomerOrder.OrderView_OrderID |
| Name | CustomerOrder.Name<br>or<br>CustomerOrder.CustomerView_Name |
| OrderView_Name | CustomerOrder.OrderView_Name |
| Product | CustomerOrder.Product<br>or<br>CustomerOrder.OrderView_Product |

### Joins: different search results according to the order of the views in the join
<a name="joins_different_search_results_according_the_order_the_views_the_join_ELTPARAGRAPHE000403"></a>

During a join between two views, the index of second view is used to perform searches on the result of the join. The search result can differ depending on the characteristics of the index used in the join.

Example:

- Characteristics of key item named *MyItem* in View1: Case-insensitive searches.

- Characteristics of item named *MyItem* in View2: Case-sensitive search.




A merge is performed between these two views. Depending on the order of the merged views, the result of the search will be different:

- HMergeView(View3, View1, View2): the search is performed on view2: 15 records are found.

- HMergeView(View3, View2, View1): the search is performed on view1: 63 records are found.

To handle a Hyper File 5 database with **&lt;Source&gt;.MergeView**, you must perform the merge with **HCreateView_55**.
