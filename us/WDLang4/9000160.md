## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000171"></a>
The ODBC driver for HFSQL Classic (single-user or multi-user) is used to access an HFSQL Classic database from an external database software that supports the accesses by ODBC.

The ODBC driver for HFSQL Client/Server allows access to an HFSQL Client/Server database from an external database software that supports access via ODBC.

The driver is available in read/write. An application written in external language can read and write in HFSQL files.

The ODBC driver for HFSQL Classic and HFSQL Client/Server is an ODBC driver of level 3. See a specific documentation for more details.

**Remarks**: 

- This help page explains how to install the ODBC driver for HFSQL Classic and HFSQL Client/Server for Linux. The setup of the ODBC driver for HFSQL Classic and HFSQL Client/Server for Windows is presented in the [ODBC driver for HFSQL Classic and for HFSQL Client/Server](../WDLang4/3044179.md) page. 

- To give access to the HFSQL data via the ODBC driver, the ODBC driver for Linux must be installed manually on the computer where the HFSQL data is installed.

## Setup
<a name="setup_ELTTEXTE000195"></a>


### Prerequisite: installing the iODBC manager
<a name="prerequisite_installing_the_iodbc_manager_ELTPARAGRAPHE000030"></a>

The ODBC driver in Linux uses the iODBC manager ([http://www.iodbc.org/](http://www.iodbc.org/)). This program must be installed before using the driver. 

To install this driver on Ubuntu, all you have to do is install the libiodbc-dev package: 


```txt
apt-get install libiodbc2-dev
apt-get install iodbc
```



### Installing the driver
<a name="installing_the_driver_ELTPARAGRAPHE000042"></a>

The ODBC driver on Linux is supplied in 32-bit and 64-bit versions in the "INSTALL\\ODBC" directory of setup directory of WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile: 

- In 32-bit: wxpackodbclinux32.zip

- In 64-bit: wxpackodbclinux64.zip




To install it: 

- Unzip the requested pack int a local directory ("/opt/wdhfo" for example). 

- Run the "install.sh" script as follows: 
	
	```txt
	>cd /path/to/driver/
	>sudo ./install.sh
	```





Remark: This script registers the driver beside iODBC. For more details, use: 

```txt
install.sh -help
```

## Configuring the database
<a name="configuring_the_database_ELTTEXTE000225"></a>


### Overview
<a name="overview_ELTPARAGRAPHE000065"></a>

Two methods can be used to configure a data source: 

- use [the graphic tool of iODBC](#NOTE4_2). 

- perform the configuration [manually](#NOTE4_3).

### Configuring a data source via the graphic tool of iODBC
<a name="configuring_data_source_via_the_graphic_tool_iodbc_ELTPARAGRAPHE000081"></a>

- Start the "iodbcadm-gtk" tool. 

- The following window appears: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=iodbc1.gif)


- Click "Add". 

- In the list that is displayed, select the HFSQL driver and click "Finish". The following window appears: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=iodbc2.gif)


- Enter the keys manually: 

	- For an ISAM connection: 

		- FileDir: Directory of .FIC files

		- Analysis: path of WDD. This parameter is optional




- For a Client/Server connection: 

	- Server Name: Name of server

	- Server Port: Port to use

	- Database: Name of database

	- UID: User name

	- PWD: User password

	- Analysis: path of WDD. This parameter is optional. <br>![Example for an ISAM connection](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=iodbc3.gif)

- Validate the dialog twice. 




The source is configured. You can run its test it with the "iodbctest" program.

```txt
iodbctest "DSN=MyODBCSource"
```

<a name="NOTE4_3"></a>


### Manual configuration
<a name="manual_configuration_ELTPARAGRAPHE000114"></a>

- Create an ".odbc.ini" file at the root of the "home" directory. 

- For each source, add the following lines into this file: 

	- ISAM HFSQL source:
			
		```txt
		[ODBC Data Sources] 
		<Source Name> = HFSQL 
		[<Source Name>] 
		Driver = /path/vers/WD220hfo64.so 
		FileDir = <path of files>
		```


	- HFSQL C/S source: 
			
		```txt
		[ODBC Data Sources] 
		<Source Name> = HFSQL 
		[<Source Name>] 
		Server Name = <Name of server>
		Server Port = <Port to use>
		Database = <Name of database>
		UID = <Name of user>
		PWD = <Password of user>
		```
