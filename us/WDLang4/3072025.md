## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000188"></a>
Two types of browse can be used to browse the result of a query run by [SQLExec](../WDLang4/3072007.md)

- Type of iteration: [SQLFirst](../WDLang4/3072017.md)/[SQLCol](../WDLang4/3072018.md)

- Type of iteration: [SQLFetch](../WDLang4/3072011.md)/[SQLGetCol](../WDLang4/3072019.md).




The following paragraphs present the benefits and the drawbacks of these two methods.

## Comparing the two methods
<a name="comparing_the_two_methods_ELTTEXTE000212"></a>
The table below presents the characteristics of the two browsing methods:


|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   | **SQLFirst/SQLCol browse** | **SQLFetch/SQLGetCol browse** |
| **Query result** | All the records found in the query result are loaded in memory when running [SQLFirst](../WDLang4/3072017.md).<br>The first call to [SQLFirst](../WDLang4/3072017.md) can be quite long. | No record is loaded in memory. The query result is managed by the database. |
| **Number of records** | The number of records corresponding to the query result is automatically calculated when reading the first record ([SQLFirst](../WDLang4/3072017.md)). The SQL.NbLine variable is updated | The number of records corresponding to the query result is not calculated. |
| **SQLInfo** | [SQLInfo](../WDLang4/3072028.md) returns information about the query and the current browse. | [SQLInfo](../WDLang4/3072028.md) returns general information about the query or the connection. |
| **Browsing the records** | Ability to go back to a previous result element | No ability to go back to a previous result element |
|   | The query result is read by [SQLCol](../WDLang4/3072018.md), [SQLAssociate](../WDLang4/3072004.md). | The query result is read by [SQLGetCol](../WDLang4/3072019.md) and [SQLGetMemo](../WDLang4/3072020.md). |
| **Display in a table** | [SQLTable](../WDLang4/3072031.md) must not be used (fatal error). | [SQLTable](../WDLang4/3072031.md) can only be used to retrieve the result records from the current record. |
| **Management of tabulations** | This type of browse cannot be used to retrieve the tabulations found in the values of records. A tabulation separates two items. Only the part found before the tabulation will be retrieved by the read functions. <br>For more details, see the help about [SQLCol](../WDLang4/3072018.md) and [SQLAssociate](../WDLang4/3072004.md). | This type of browse can be used to retrieve the tabulations found in the values of records.<br>For more details, see the help about [SQLGetCol](../WDLang4/3072019.md). |



**Example of SQLFirst/SQLCol browse**


```wl
ResExec = SQLExec("SELECT CUSTNAME FROM INV","QRY1")
IF ResExec THEN 
	SQLFirst("QRY1") 
	// Transfer the name into LIST_NAMELIST
	WHILE NOT SQL.Out
		ListAdd(LIST_NAMELIST, SQLCol("QRY1",1))
		SQLNext("QRY1")
	END
ELSE
	// ProcessError
END
SQLClose("QRY1")
```


**Example of SQLFetch/SQLGetCol browse**


```wl
i is int = 0
SQLExec("SELECT LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME, EXTENSION, PHOTO FROM CUSTOMER", "QRY1")
// Retrieve the query row by row
WHILE SQLFetch("QRY1") = 0 
	// There is still another line
	i++
	// Retrieve the data
	LASTNAME[i] = SQLGetCol("QRY1", 1)
	FIRSTNAME[i] = SQLGetCol("QRY1", 2)
	EXTENSION[i] = SQLGetCol("QRY1",3)
	{"IMAGE"+i} = SQLGetMemo("QRY1", 4)
END
SQLClose("QRY1")
```
