	From version <B>20</B>, SQL views and the materialized views are available.<br>The views handled by this function correspond to the former view mechanism. They do not correspond to SQL views or to materialized views.

Runs a view that was created beforehand (can be used to refresh the view data for example). If the view was created by [HCreateView](../WDLang4/3044159.md) with the *hViewPostponed* constant, **HExecuteView** must be used to run the view.

**Reminder**: a view corresponds to the image of a data file at a given time. A view is stored in memory, which insulates it from the modifications performed in the associated data file. A view can be handled like a standard HFSQL data file.


<a name="Example1"></a>
<a name="sample_code"></a>

## Example


```wl
// Runs the Customer34 view
HExecuteView(Customer34)
```

<a name="XSYNTAX"></a>
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

## Syntax

`<Result> = HExecuteView(<View> [, <Selection condition>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the view was run,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) returns more details about the problem.




**`<View>: (Character string (with or without quotes))`**

Name of view to run. This name was defined by [HCreateView](../WDLang4/3044159.md).

**`<Selection condition>: (Optional character string)`**



- New selection condition for the view records (&lt;Selection Condition&gt; replaces the condition specified when creating the view). This selection condition can be an Ansi or Unicode character string.

- Empty string ("") to avoid modifying the selection condition.

<a name="NOTE0_1"></a>

## Remarks


### Selection condition 
<a name="selection_condition_ELTPARAGRAPHE000100"></a>

The general syntax of a condition has the following format:

"CustName&gt;'Smith' and ZipCode=34 or ZipCode=32"

The supported operators depend on the type of items used in the condition:


|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| &lt;&gt; | Not equal to | Valid for all types |
| &gt; | Greater than | Valid for all types |
| &gt;= | Greater than or equal to | Valid for all types |
| &lt; | Less than | Valid for all types |
| &lt;= | Less than or equal to | Valid for all types |
| = | Strictly equal to | Valid for all types |
| ~= | Almost equal to | Valid for string types only |
| ] | Contains | Valid for string types only |
| ]= | Starts with | Valid for string types only |


Notes about the selection condition:

- Constant strings must be enclosed in single quotes.

- If an item name is used in the selection condition, it must only contain letters, numbers and underscore characters ("_"). If the item name contains other characters (apostrophe, etc.), the name of the item must be enclosed in double quotes. 
	For example: "e_mail@"]'com'

- Comparisons between strings are performed according to the ASCII value of the characters and not according to the lexicographic value ('a' > 'Z').

- The binary memos, the composite keys and the subscripted items cannot be part of a selection condition.

- If a *&lt;string constant&gt;* contains single quotes (or double quotes), they must be preceded by a backslash (\\).

- **All the items of the main data file can be included in the condition** (even the ones that are not items of the view).

- The condition is applied to each virtual record before it is included in the view. Therefore, you cannot specify several mutually excluding conditions for the same record (join). For example:

	- "Date='1997' and Date='1996'" returns no result.

	- "Date&gt;='1996' and Date&lt;='1997'" returns all the records found between 1996 and 1997.




- This selection condition can be an Ansi or Unicode character string.
