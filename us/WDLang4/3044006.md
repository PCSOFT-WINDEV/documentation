## Syntax

`<Result> = HNbRec([<Data file> [, <Options>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**



- Number of records found,

- -1 if an error occurred. [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) returns more details about the problem.


![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) **Native XML Connector**: the number of records depends on the use of [HActivateAutoFilter](../WDLang4/3044297.md)/[HDeactivateAutoFilter](../WDLang4/3044298.md):

- If the filtering is enabled, only the records belonging to the current parent are taken into account.

- If the filter is not active, the records found in the XML file are taken into account.




The filtering is enabled by default.

**`<Data file>: (Optional character string)`**

Name of data file, HFSQL view or query used. If this parameter is not specified, **HNbRec** will use the last data file used by the last HFSQL management function (function starting with "H").

**`<Options>: (Optional constant (or combination of constants))`**

Configures the type of record to count.

| *hBrowsableNonBlocking* | Number of records in the view or query that can currently be read (no record locking). <br>This constant is available for the views and queries in HFSQL Classic or Client/Server.<br>This constant has no effect for the data files and for the Native Connectors |
| *hNonBlocking* | Number of records retrieved in the view or query without waiting for the view or query to be entirely filled.

| *hStateActive*<br>(default value) | Number of active records (not crossed or deleted). |
| *hStateAll* | Total number of records in the data file (*hStateActive* + *hStateCrossed* + *hStateDel*). |
| *hStateCrossed* | Number of crossed records.<br><br>![Hyper File 5.5](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HF55.png) This option is not available. |
| *hStateDel* | Number of deleted records (does not include the crossed records). |


![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) This parameter is ignored. The number of records calculated by **HNbRec** always corresponds to the total number of records in the table, in the database.

This number can differ from the number of displayed records if records have been added or deleted by another user. To view these new records, reinitialize an iteration by using one of the following functions: [HReadFirst](../WDLang4/3044051.md), [HReadLast](../WDLang4/3044140.md), [HFirst](../WDLang4/3044113.md), [HLast](../WDLang4/3044101.md).![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) **Access by JDBC**

## Remarks


### Limitations
<a name="limitations_ELTPARAGRAPHE000201"></a>

- **HNbRec** does not return the number of records modified by an UPDATE query.

- **HNbRec** does not work with queries that use the *hWithFilter* constant.

### xBase
<a name="xbase_ELTPARAGRAPHE000217"></a>

**HNbRec** with the *hStateActive* or *hStateAll* constant also returns the number of crossed or deleted records (backward compatibility).

However, you can get the number of crossed or deleted records by using **HNbRec** with the *hStateDel* or *hStateCrossed* constant.

### Number of records processed by the INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE updates
<a name="number_records_processed_the_insertupdatedelete_updates_ELTPARAGRAPHE000234"></a>

**When running an INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE query on HFSQL data files**, the number of added, modified or deleted records is returned by the [H.NbRecModificationQuery](../WDLang4/3087002.md) variable.
