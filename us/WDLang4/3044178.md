## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000409"></a>
A composite key is a key item containing several other items. These items can be text items or numeric items.

A composite key is used to simplify the searches performed on several criteria.

The composite keys are binary items. Their value cannot be directly displayed (in a trace or in a control).

This page presents the following topics:

## Creating a composite key
<a name="creating_composite_key_ELTTEXTE000433"></a>
A composite key is created in the data model editor directly.

To create a composite key in the description of a data file:

1. Open the description of the data file items: 

	- Select the data file in the editor. 

	- Open the context menu (right click) and select "Description of items".




2. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Manipulations_rubriques%20-%20HC%20N%B0001%207.gif)
. A screen appears, allowing you to build the composite key.

3. The list of items found in the data file is displayed in the table on the left. Double-click the items that must be included in the composite key. These items are displayed in the table on the right.

4. Reorganize (if necessary) the items that belong to the composite key. 
	**Caution**: the order of items is important because it defines the sort order. For example, the "Name + State" composite key will be sorted on the name then on the state.

5. Specify the search direction and the search parameters for each key component.

6. Validate. The composite key is displayed in the list of data file items.

### Composite key and link
<a name="composite_key_and_link_ELTPARAGRAPHE000071"></a>

Composite keys can be used in the links between data files. When describing the analysis, the composite key found in the linked data file appears not as a composite key but as a ***binary key***. You will not be able to access the different components of composite key in the linked data file.

**Remarks**: 

- The management of referential integrity is supported for a composite key used in a link.

- The management of modifications in cascade is not supported for a composite key used in a link.

## Value of composite key
<a name="value_composite_key_ELTTEXTE000463"></a>


### Overview
<a name="overview_ELTPARAGRAPHE000085"></a>

A composite key is stored as a binary string. Its value cannot be displayed (neither in a control nor in the debugger, ...).
<a name="NOTE3_2"></a>


### Adding a record containing a composite key
<a name="adding_record_containing_composite_key_ELTPARAGRAPHE000092"></a>

When adding or modifying a record containing a composite key, the value of the composite key is automatically defined according to the values of different key components. No specific programming is required.
<a name="NOTE3_3"></a>


### Adding a record that contains a composite key into a linked data file
<a name="adding_record_that_contains_composite_key_into_linked_data_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000099"></a>

When a record that contains a composite key is added into a linked data file, the value of the key must be built. Indeed, in the linked data file, the composite key is not considered as a composite key but as a binary key. Therefore, a value must be assigned to it.

This value can be assigned:

- directly. For example, a record has been added in the Customer data file. To add the key value to the linked data file, simply perform a direct assignment: 
	
	```wl
	LinkFile.NameDate = Customer.NameDate
	```


- via the [HBuildKeyValue](../WDLang4/3044258.md) function . This function is used to build the value of composite key from its components.



<a name="NOTE3_4"></a>


### Building the value of a composite key to implement a search or a filter
<a name="building_the_value_composite_key_implement_search_filter_ELTPARAGRAPHE000116"></a>

When a filter or a search is implemented on a composite key, the value of composite key must be defined (to define the lower bound and the upper bound of filter for example).

Several methods can be used to build the value of a composite key:

- Method 1: Using a list of values in [HFilter](../WDLang4/3044100.md).

- Method 2: Using the [FOR EACH](../Motscles/1510013.md) statement.

- Method 3: Using the [HBuildKeyValue](../WDLang4/3044258.md) function.

- Method 4: Using [HConvertX](../WDLang4/3044260.md) (method kept for backward compatibility with WINDEV 5.5)




**Method 1: List of values**

All you have to do is specify the list of values that must be taken by each component of composite key for the filter or for the search. The composite key is directly built in the syntax of function.

**Example**: Find all the records in the Customer data file whose last name is between "AA" and "Barnaby" and whose first name is between "Philomene" and "Tartuffe".


```wl
HFilter(Customer, LastNameFirstName, ["AA", "Philomene"], ["Barnaby", "Tartuffe"])
```
 In this example, "AA","Zorro" is returned by the filter while "Philomene","Zorro" is not.

**Example**: Find all the records in the Tasks data file whose tasks are included between 03/15/2011 00:00 and 03/25/2011 00:00.


```wl
HFilter(Tasks, TaskStarDateTaskStartTime, [20110315,0000], [20110325,0000])
```


**Method 2: Using the FOR EACH statement**

Specify the list of values that must be taken by each key component for the filter or for the search. The composite key is directly built in the syntax of function.

**Example**: Finding the prospect customers living in state 69.


```wl
FOR EACH Contacts WHERE CCState = ["Prospect", 69]
...
END
```


**Method 3: Using HBuildKeyValue**

The value of a composite key can be built by [HBuildKeyValue](../WDLang4/3044258.md). To do so, the relevant data file, the key name and the values of components must be specified in this function.

For example, the following line of code is used to build the value of composite key ("NAMEDATE") corresponding to "CUSTOMERNAME+ORDER_DATE" of Customer data file:


```wl
HBuildKeyValue(Customer, NAMEDATE, "SMITH","03/11/99")
```


**Method 4: Using HConvertX (method kept for backward compatibility with WINDEV 5.5)**

You must:

- entirely fill the text components with the *hMinVal* constant.

- convert the numeric components with [HConvert](../WDLang4/3044260.md).




Example:


```wl
MyCompositeKey = Complete(Customer.CustomerLastName, Dimension(Customer.LastName), hMinval)) + ...
	Complete(Customer.FirstName, Dimension (Customer.FirstName), hMinVal)
```

<a name="NOTE3_5"></a>


### WLanguage properties associated with composite keys
<a name="wlanguage_properties_associated_with_composite_keys_ELTPARAGRAPHE000188"></a>The following properties are used to manage composite keys through programming:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [Binary](../Proprietes/2512001.md) | The **Binary** property is used to determine if an item is binary. |
| [Component](../Proprietes/2512020.md) | The **Component** property configures the different components of a composite key. |
| [CompositeKey](../Proprietes/2512004.md) | The **CompositeKey** property is used to determine if an item is a composite key. |
| [KeyExpression](../Proprietes/2512035.md) | The **KeyExpression** property is used to set the different components of a composite key. |
| [NbComponent](../Proprietes/2512058.md) | The **NbComponent** property is used to get the number of elements in a composite key. |

## Using a composite key to perform exact-match searches
<a name="using_composite_key_perform_exactmatch_searches_ELTTEXTE000538"></a>


### Exact-match search performed by HReadSeekFirst
<a name="exactmatch_search_performed_hreadseekfirst_ELTPARAGRAPHE000198"></a>

To perform an exact-match search on the value of a composite key, you must:

1. Build the value of the search key with [HBuildKeyValue](../WDLang4/3044258.md). All the values of key components must be specified.

2. Use the [HReadSeekFirst](../WDLang4/3044036.md) function.




**Remark**: By default, [HReadSeekFirst](../WDLang4/3044036.md) is used to perform an exact-match search.


```wl
ValCompKey is Buffer
ValCompKey = HBuildKeyValue(Customer, Name_ZC, "Smith", "34000")
HReadSeekFirst(Customer, Name_ZC, ValCompKey)
WHILE HFound() = True
	...

## Using a composite key to perform generic searches
<a name="using_composite_key_perform_generic_searches_ELTTEXTE000568"></a>


### Generic search performed by HReadSeekFirst
<a name="generic_search_performed_hreadseekfirst_ELTPARAGRAPHE000246"></a>

To perform a generic search on the value of a composite key, you must:

1. Build the value of the search key with [HBuildKeyValue](../WDLang4/3044258.md). Only the values of first key components can be specified.

## Using a composite key to create filters
<a name="using_composite_key_create_filters_ELTTEXTE000598"></a>


### Functions for creating filters
<a name="functions_for_creating_filters_ELTPARAGRAPHE000294"></a>

In addition to [HFilter](../WDLang4/3044100.md), several WLanguage functions can be used to create specific filters. These functions can handle the composite keys:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [HFilter](../WDLang4/3044100.md) | Defines and enables a filter on a data file, view or query. |
| [HFilterIdentical](../WDLang4/3044105.md) | Defines and enables a filter used to find the exact value of a string item. |
| [HFilterIncludedBetween](../WDLang4/3044097.md) | Defines and enables an "Included between" filter on a file, view or query. |
| [HFilterStartsWith](../WDLang4/3044098.md) | Defines and enables a "Start with" filter on a file, view or query. |




<a name="NOTE6_2"></a>


### Filter between two values (bounds)
<a name="filter_between_two_values_bounds_ELTPARAGRAPHE000305"></a>

To filter records between two specific values of a composite key, you must:

1. Create the values of each bound with [HBuildKeyValue](../WDLang4/3044258.md).

2. Create the filter with [HFilter](../WDLang4/3044100.md) and specify the two bounds.

3. Browse the selected records.



```wl
sFilterKey1 = HBuildKeyValue(CUSTOMER, NAME_ZC, "MOORE", "34000")
sFilterKey2 = HBuildKeyValue(CUSTOMER, NAME_ZC, "MOORE", "34999")
sSearchKey= HFilter(Customer, NAME_ZC,  sFilterKey1,  sFilterKey2)
HReadFirst(Customer, sSearchKey)
WHILE NOT HOut()
	...
	HReadNext(Customer, sSearchKey)
End
```

<a name="NOTE6_3"></a>


### Filter from a given value
<a name="filter_from_given_value_ELTPARAGRAPHE000324"></a>

To filter the records from a given value (without specifying any upper bound), you must: 

1. Create the value of lower bound with [HBuildKeyValue](../WDLang4/3044258.md).

2. Create the filter with [HFilter](../WDLang4/3044100.md) while specifying the lower and upper bounds. In this case, the upper bound is equal to the *hMaxVal* constant.

3. Browse the selected records.



```wl
sFilterKey = HBuildKeyValue(CUSTOMER, NAME_ZC, "MOORE", "34000")
sSearchKey = HFilter(Customer, NAME_ZC, sFilterKey, hMaxVal)
HReadFirst(Customer, sSearchKey)
WHILE NOT HOut()
	...
	HReadNext(Customer, sSearchKey)
END
```

<a name="NOTE6_4"></a>


### Filter on the first key components
<a name="filter_the_first_key_components_ELTPARAGRAPHE000343"></a>

To filter the records on the first components of a composite key and to perform a sort on the following components, you must:

1. Create the minimum and maximum values of composite key with [HBuildKeyValue](../WDLang4/3044258.md). Only the first components must be specified.

2. Create the filter with [HFilter](../WDLang4/3044100.md) while specifying the lower and upper bounds. In this case, the *hMinVal* constant must be added to the lower bound and *hMaxVal* must be added to the upper bound. Remarks: *hMinVal* is equivalent to Char(0) and *hMaxVal* is equivalent to Char(255).

3. Browse the selected records.



<a name="NOTE6_5"></a>


### Remark: Filter with selection condition
<a name="remark_filter_with_selection_condition_ELTPARAGRAPHE000360"></a>

If the filter condition affects several items corresponding to a composite key of the data file, the search key automatically selected by the filter will be this composite key.
