<a name="Use"></a>
<a name="description"></a>
Starts a transaction on the data files (HFSQL or accessed via a Native Connector) and creates the transaction file.

**What information is saved in the transaction file?** Whenever a WLanguage function modifies a data file or an index file during a transaction, the former values of the record and the operation performed are stored in the transaction file.

![HFSQL Client/Server](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HFCS.png) This function proposes two operating modes of transactions: 

- The transaction can be started on a connection: In this case, a transaction is started only for the data files associated to this connection. This mode is required to manage the [isolation levels of transactions](../WDLang4/1000017316.md). 

- The transaction can be started on all HFSQL connections (existing ones or future ones). In this case, **HTransaction** starts both an HFSQL Classic transaction (ISAM) and an HFSQL Client/Server transaction.




**Remark**: This function is equivalent to [HTransactionStart](../WDLang4/3044002.md).

## Example


```wl
MyConnection1 is Connection

// Start transaction on data files associated with MyConnection1
HTransaction(MyConnection1)
Add_Order()
WHEN EXCEPTION IN
	// Add the order
	HAdd(Orders) 
	// Validate the addition
	HTransactionEnd(MyConnection1)
DO
	// Delete the order lines
	HTransactionCancel(MyConnection1)
END
```
<a name="Example2"></a>

```wl
// Start transaction on the Orders and OrdLine data files
HTransaction("C:\Temp\Transaction.trs", "Orders,OrdLine,-Customer")
Add_Order()
WHEN EXCEPTION IN
	// Add the order
	HAdd(Orders) 
	// Validate the addition
	HTransactionEnd() 
DO
	// Delete the order lines
	HTransactionCancel() 
END
```

## Syntax

### Starting a Client/Server transaction on a specific connection

`<Result> = HTransaction(<Connection> [, <List of data files>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the transaction was started,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if a problem occurs. [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) returns more details about the error.




**`<Connection>: (Character string or Connection variable)`**

Connection to use. This connection corresponds to: 

- the name of the connection defined in the data model editor or with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

- the name of a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md).




If this parameter corresponds to an empty string ("") or to the *hAccessHF7* constant: The transaction is performed on the ISAM HFSQL files. 

**`<List of data files>: (Optional character string)`**

List of logical names of one or more data files to take into account (or not) in the transaction (in this case, the data file name is preceded by the "-" sign).


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| **If this parameter is not specified** | All data files used during the transaction will be taken into account in the transaction. |
| **If all data files are prefixed with the "-" sign**<br>For example: "-Customer, -Product" | All data files specified in the list and used during the transaction will not be taken into account by the transaction.<br>All data files not specified in the list will be taken into account and used during the transaction. |
| **If no data file on the list is prefixed with the "-" sign**<br>For example: "Customer, Product" | All data files specified in the list and used during the transaction will be taken into account in the transaction. <br>All data files not specified and manipulated during the transaction will be ignored in the transaction. |
| **If some data files are prefixed with "-" and others are not**<br>For example: "-Customer, Product" (equivalent to "Product") | All data files in the list prefixed with "-" and used during the transaction will be ignored in the transaction.<br>All data files in the list not prefixed with "-" and used during the transaction will be taken into account in the transaction.<br>Data files not specified in the list will be excluded from the transaction. |


![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) This parameter is ignored. All the data files associated with the connection are in transaction on the native server.

## Remarks
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![User code (UMC)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/MCU.png)![HFSQL Classic](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HF.png) 

### Network application (ISAM database)
<a name="network_application_isam_database_ELTPARAGRAPHE000324"></a>

In network, the transaction file can be created on a local disk or on a network drive.

- **If the transaction file is installed on a local computer**, this file will contain information regarding the transactions performed by the current computer. In this case, the transaction file is deleted when the transaction is ended.

- **If the transaction file is installed on a network drive (recommended),** this file will contain information regarding the transactions performed by several computers. Each computer is identified by a unique number. In this case, the transaction file is deleted when the last transaction is ended.



<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Locking records
<a name="locking_records_ELTPARAGRAPHE000336"></a>

The added, modified or deleted records in a transaction are locked in write mode.
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Error cases
<a name="error_cases_ELTPARAGRAPHE000345"></a>

- Nesting transactions: Transactions cannot be nested (i.e. **HTransaction** cannot be called in a transaction). In this case, error 70031 occurs.

- A fatal error is displayed in the following cases: 

	- A transaction is started on all the connections while there is at least one connection in transaction. 

	- A transaction is started on a connection while a transaction was already started on all the connections. 

	- A transaction is started on all the connections while there is at least one connection whose isolation mode is not "Read Uncommitted".

### Temporary files created during the transaction (ISAM database)
<a name="temporary_files_created_during_the_transaction_isam_database_ELTPARAGRAPHE000365"></a>

During the transaction, temporary files (".TRX" extension) are created in the directory containing the data files (".FIC" files). These temporary files must not be deleted. Otherwise, the data handled by the transaction could be damaged.

**Remark**: These temporary files are automatically deleted at the end of the transaction.
<a name="NOTE0_5"></a>


### Handling records during a transaction
<a name="handling_records_during_transaction_ELTPARAGRAPHE000376"></a>

During a transaction, some rules must be complied with when handling the records. For more details, see [Transactions: Handling records during a transaction](../WDLang4/3044336.md).
<a name="NOTE0_6"></a>


### Transactions and independent HFSQL context
<a name="transactions_and_independent_hfsql_context_ELTPARAGRAPHE000388"></a>

When copying a context, if a transaction is in progress on the first context, the new context is not in transaction. You must call **HTransaction** to start a transaction in the new context.

### OLE DB and Native Connectors
<a name="ole_and_native_connectors_ELTPARAGRAPHE000401"></a>

Only syntaxes with connection are taken into account by the Native Connectors that support transactions. You can also use [SQLTransaction](../WDLang4/3072029.md).
