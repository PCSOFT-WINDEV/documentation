Locks a data file and restricts the access to this data file for all other sites or applications. Then, the data file can be unlocked by [HUnlockFile](../WDLang4/3044160.md).

Several cases may occur after the call to **HLockFile**:

- A file record is already locked by another application: the lock cannot be performed.

- The data file is already locked by another application: the lock cannot be performed.




[HErrorLock](../WDLang4/3044099.md) returns <u><u><u>True</u></u></u> if a lock problem occurs.

![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This function can be used with HFSQL Client/Server data files.

## Example


```wl
// Lock the CUSTOMER data file
IF HLockFile(CUSTOMER, hLockReadWrite) = False THEN
	IF HErrorLock() = True THEN
		Error("Operation not allowed")
	END
END
// Process on data file ...
...
// Restore access to data file
HUnlockFile()
```

## Syntax

`<Result> = HLockFile([<Data file> [, <Lock>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the lock was performed,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if a problem occurred (the file is already locked for example). [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) is used to identify the error.




**`<Data file>: (Optional character string)`**

Name of the data file used. 
If this name is not specified, **HLockFile** will use the last data file used by the last HFSQL function (function starting with "H").

**`<Lock>: (Optional integer constant)`**

Used to define the type of lock performed on the data file:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hLockNo* | No effect |
| *hLockReadWrite* | Lock in read/write: the records found in the data file cannot be read or modified by another application. No lock on the data file can be defined by another application. |
| *hLockWrite*<br>(default value) | Lock in write mode: the records found in the data file can be read by another application but cannot be modified by another application. No lock on the data file can be defined by another application. |


![Hyper File 5.5](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HF55.png) &lt;Lock&gt; is ignored.![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) The management of locks is performed on the HFSQL Client/Server data files only.

## Remarks


### Modifying the type of lock for a data file
<a name="modifying_the_type_lock_for_data_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000152"></a>

To modify the type of lock applied to a data file, call **HLockFile** and specify the requested type of lock. There is no need to unlock the data file beforehand.
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Effect of lock mode
<a name="effect_lock_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000163"></a>

If the data file lock mode is set to *hModeMono* (see [HMode](../WDLang4/3044039.md)), **HLockFile** has no effect.
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Lock failure
<a name="lock_failure_ELTPARAGRAPHE000177"></a>

If the data file (or one of its records) is already locked, the lock request is retried [H.NbRetry](../WDLang4/3044075.md) times (50 by default).

If the data file cannot be locked after ***H.NbRetry*** attempts, [HErrorLock](../WDLang4/3044099.md) returns <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>.
