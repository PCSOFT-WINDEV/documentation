<a name="description"></a>
Creates the description file of a subscriber replica. The extension of the file corresponding to the subscriber replica is .RPL.

This function can be used with the logged replication and/or with the universal replication

**Caution**: When creating a subscriber replica, you must:

- have created the master replica ([HCreateMasterReplica](../WDLang4/3044175.md)).

- have access to the master replica.


![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) Only the universal replication is available. 

Remark: The replication is not available when accessing a database via .

## Syntax

### Universal replication

`<Result> = HCreateSubscriberReplica(<Directory of master replica> , <Directory of subscriber replica> , <Identifier> , <Size of range of identifiers> , <List of tables to replicate> [, <Automatic modification>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**



- Identifier of Subscriber Replica that was created, 

- 0 if no subscriber replica was created.




**`<Directory of master replica>: (Character string)`**

Directory where the description file of Master Replica (RPM file) was created ([HCreateMasterReplica](../WDLang4/3044175.md)). This directory can be a network directory or a UNC path. 
If this parameter corresponds to an empty string (""), the description file will be sought in the current directory of HFSQL data files (defined in the data model editor or through programming). 
**Caution**: This directory must be accessible when **HCreateSubscriberReplica** is executed.

**`<Directory of subscriber replica>: (Character string)`**

Directory where the description file of Subscriber Replica must be created. This file is named **Replica_&lt;Identifier&gt;.RPL**. 
If this parameter corresponds to an empty string (""), the description file will be created in the current directory of HFSQL data files (defined in the data model editor or by programming).

**`<Identifier>: (Integer or character string)`**

Identifier of the subscriber replica. This identifier will be used by [HCreateMovableReplica](../WDLang4/3044209.md). 
A WLanguage error occurs if the specified identifier already exists.

**`<Size of range of identifiers>: (Integer)`**

This parameter is ignored.

**`<List of tables to replicate>: (Character string)`**

This list has the following format: 

```txt
<TableName>[+TAB+<NameDateItem>][+<CR>+<TableName>[+TAB+<NameDateItem>]]...
```


**Caution**: The order of the tables is important. The order of the tables is the order of the dependencies for the tables. 
If the records of file 1 are linked to the records of file 2 and if the record must be found in file 2 in order for the addition in file 1 to comply with the integrity rules, then file 1 must be positioned first in the list. 
For example, for the "Customer", "Orders" and "Order line" files (that are linked by links whose cardinalities are (0,n) - (1,1)), the "Customer" file must be positioned first (a customer must exist to add an order), then the "Orders" file (an order must exist to add an order line) and finally the "Order line" file.

The name of Date item is mandatory for the databases not in HFSQL format. This item must correspond to an item of the data file updated during an addition or during a modification. This operation must be performed by the application.  

**`<Automatic modification>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> to take into account the automatic data modification. In this case: 

	- Changes in the structure of the master database will be carried over to the subscriber database.

	- The new items will be taken into account by the replication. 




- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> (default value). The automatic data modification performed on the master database is not carried over to the subscriber database. 


Caution:

- For existing replications, it is necessary to recreate a replication (as well as the subscribers) to implement this mechanism.

- This mechanism does not work if a unique key is added or deleted. 

- This parameter is only available for replication between HFSQL databases (Classic or Client/Server).

### Logged replication (between HFSQL databases)

`<Result> = HCreateSubscriberReplica(<Directory of master replica> , <Directory of subscriber replica> [, <Identifier> [, <Size of range of identifiers>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**



- Identifier of Subscriber Replica that was created, 

- 0 if no subscriber replica was created.




**`<Directory of master replica>: (Character string)`**

Directory where the description file of Master Replica (RPM file) was created ([HCreateMasterReplica](../WDLang4/3044175.md)). This directory can be a network directory or a UNC path. 
If this parameter corresponds to an empty string (""), the description file will be sought in the current directory of HFSQL data files (defined in the data model editor or through programming). 
**Caution**: this directory must be accessible when **HCreateSubscriberReplica** is executed.

**`<Directory of subscriber replica>: (Character string)`**

Directory where the description file of Subscriber Replica must be created. This file is named **Replica_&lt;Identifier&gt;.RPL**. 
If this parameter corresponds to an empty string (""), the description file will be created in the current directory of HFSQL data files (defined in the data model editor or by programming).

**`<Identifier>: (Optional integer or character string)`**

Identifier of the subscriber replica. This identifier will be used by [HCreateMovableReplica](../WDLang4/3044209.md). 
If this parameter corresponds to an empty string (""), an identifier is automatically returned by the function. A WLanguage error occurs if the specified identifier already exists.

**`<Size of range of identifiers>: (Optional integer)`**

Size of the range of numbers reserved for the automatic identifiers for this replica. These identifiers will be used for all the new records created by this replica. 

- If this parameter is not specified, the size of the range of reserved identifiers is set to 1 billion. 

- If this parameter is set to 0, no range is reserved for the automatic identifiers.

### Log-based replication: Directory for creating the files required by the replication and by the log process
<a name="logbased_replication_directory_for_creating_the_files_required_the_replication_and_the_log_process_ELTPARAGRAPHE000180"></a>

Log-based replication is closely linked to the log process. The log process is automatically enabled when the replication is implemented in an application.

For all the files used (data files, log files or replication files), the paths of the corresponding physical files can be defined in the data model editor or by programming.

By default, the tree structure of data files is as follows (example for the SalesMgt application):

![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Replic_repertoire.gif)


The following table presents the default value for these different directories and their configuration mode in the data model editor or by programming.

|   | Default value | Where to configure it in the data model editor? | How to change the default value through programming? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Directory of data files** | Executable directory. | <br><br>- For all the data files of the application: "Details" tab of the analysis description<br><br>- For each data file: "Info" tab of the description of the data file.<br><br><br> | To modify the default directory for the data files of the application, use [HSubstDir](../WDLang4/3044028.md).<br>When creating the files for the log process and for the replication, the created directories will be relative to this new directory.<br>Remark: To modify the directory for one of the data files only, use [HChangeDir](../WDLang4/3044168.md). |
| **Directory of the files for replication** | RPL sub-directory of the default directory of the data files. | "Log\\Replica" tab of the analysis description. | Specify the desired directory in [HCreateMasterReplica](../WDLang4/3044175.md) and [HCreateSubscriberReplica](../WDLang4/3044253.md). |
| **Directory of files for log process** | JNL subdirectory of the default directory of data files. | <br><br>- For all the data files of the application: "Log\\Replica" tab of the analysis description.<br><br>- For each data file: "Various" tab of the description of the data file.<br><br><br> | To modify the directory of log files, use [HChangeLogDir](../WDLang4/3044164.md).<br> This function is used to:<br><br>- change the directory of Log file (JNL file)<br><br>- change the directory of the JNL file and the directory of the files for the log process (JournalIdentification and JournalOpération files).<br><br><br> |


**Caution**: To manage the logged replication in an application, the table of the log operations (JournalOpération.fic file) must be identical for all the data files in replication in the same analysis.
