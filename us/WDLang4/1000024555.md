**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**

- "\*", to indicate that all data files must be taken into account,

- a data file group name, defined in the analysis. 




**`<Option>: (Optional constant (or combination of constants))`**

Options for the automatic data modification: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hmsNoCheck* | The automatic data modification is performed even if:<br><br>- the description of the data file is more recent than the description of the analysis,<br><br>- the GUID of the data file is different from the GUID of the analysis.<br><br><br> |

## Remarks


- The items used by the links must exist.

- All the files of the analysis must be present if you use the "\*" parameter

- When links are updated, the links removed from the analysis are also removed from the HFSQL server. 

- You can use [HModifyStructure](../WDLang4/1000019439.md) before **HUpdateLink**.
