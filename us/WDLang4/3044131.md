## Remarks


### Reindexing
<a name="reindexing_ELTPARAGRAPHE000093"></a>The indexes are re-organized by the reindex operation. The data cannot be accessed during the reindex operation.
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) When accessing a data file on which a reindex operation is performed, the HFSQL engine displays a window indicating that a reindex operation is in progress. This window will be automatically closed at the end of the reindexing.
