<a name="description"></a>
Duplicates the record read in a data file: the record found in memory is added into the data file (query or view). The indexes corresponding to all the keys used in the data file are automatically updated. The possible memos are added if the management of memos is enabled ([HSetMemo](../WDLang4/3044139.md)).

After the call to **HDuplicateRecord**:

- An automatic management of errors is available for several types of errors: Duplicate error, integrity error, password error, modification conflict error and status error during modification conflict, lock error, ... For more details, see [Assisted HFSQL error handling](../WDLang4/3044188.md).

- If the management of duplicates is enabled and if the data file contains a unique key, [HErrorDuplicates](../WDLang4/3044077.md) returns <u><u><u>True</u></u></u> if the value of added key is not unique. The record is not added.

- The added record becomes the current record. The automatic identifier is automatically filled. By default, the current iteration is not affected.




**Remark**: The entire record in memory (the content of record previously read) is written into the data file. 

Remarks: 

- This function can also be used on a view or on a query.

- **HDuplicateRecord** and [HAdd](../WDLang4/3044147.md) are equivalent.

## Example


```wl
// Duplicates the current record
HDuplicateRecord(Customer)
```

## Syntax

`<Result> = HDuplicateRecord([<Data file> [, <Options>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the record was added,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if a problem occurred (integrity error, duplicate error, ...). [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) is used to identify the error.




**`<Data file>: (Optional character string)`**

Name of the data file, view or query used. If this name is not specified, **HDuplicateRecord** will use the last data file used by the last HFSQL function (function starting with "H").

**`<Options>: (Optional constant)`**

Used to configure:

- the effect of addition on the current browse.

- the mode for calculating the automatic identifier. For more details, see [Managing the automatic identifier during an addition](../WDLang4/3044183.md).

- the lock mode applied to the added record.

	- ![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Access by JDBC: The management of locks is not available for databases accessed by JDBC.




- the management of duplicates.

- the management of integrity.


![Hyper File 5.5](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HF55.png) This parameter is ignored.

| *hAffectBrowse* | **Effect of addition on the browse**: The addition affects the browse. <br>For example, [HReadNext](../WDLang4/3044037.md) used after **HDuplicateRecord** positions on the record found after the added record.<br>The *hAffectBrowse* constant has priority over the *hWriteDefault* constant. |
| *hCheckDuplicates* | **Management mode of duplicates**: Checks for duplicates for this operation, even if the duplicate check is disabled ([HSetDuplicates](../WDLang4/3044057.md)).<br>A WLanguage error occurs if the *hIgnoreDuplicates* and *hCheckDuplicates* constants are used at the same time.<br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Access by JDBC: This constant is not available. |

## Remarks


### Managing automatic identifiers
<a name="managing_automatic_identifiers_ELTPARAGRAPHE000283"></a>

By default, the "automatic identifier" item is automatically updated when a record is added into a data file. There is no need to read the record again to find out the value of the automatic identifier. Simply use the following syntax: &lt;File name&gt;.&lt;Name of automatic identifier item&gt;.

The *hForceIDAuto* and *hSetIDAuto* constants are used to modify the default behavior of the automatic identifier.

For more details on automatic identifiers for new records, see [Managing the automatic identifier during an addition](../WDLang4/3044183.md).
![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png)![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) **Special case**

- If the database generates an automatic identifier, the HFSQL engine keeps this value. If the *hForceIDAuto* or *hSetIDAuto* constant is specified, the HFSQL engine replaces the generated value by the desired value. 
	Remark: the *hForceIDAuto* constant is equivalent to *hSetIDAuto*: the automatic identifier calculated by the HFSQL engine during the next addition will be unique in the data file.

- If no automatic identifier is generated by the database, the HFSQL engine generates the value and assigns it to the automatic identifier.

### Reusing the deleted or freed records
<a name="reusing_the_deleted_freed_records_ELTPARAGRAPHE000309"></a>

When adding a new record, the HFSQL engine optimizes the filling of the data file. The space corresponding to the deleted or freed records is used first when a new record is added.

The crossed records are not re-used.

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png)![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png)![HFSQL Classic](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HF.png)![HFSQL Client/Server](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HFCS.png)![Hyper File 5.5](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HF55.png) 

### Version of data file after an addition
<a name="version_data_file_after_addition_ELTPARAGRAPHE000322"></a>

If the record was added to the data file (no duplicate error and no integrity error), the version number of the data file is modified. To get the version number, use [HVersion](../WDLang4/3044020.md).
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Adding a record into a query
<a name="adding_record_into_query_ELTPARAGRAPHE000334"></a>

Adding a record into a query can be performed:

- in the query result.

- in the data files handled by the query (*hModifyFile* constant used in [HExecuteQuery](../WDLang4/3044080.md) or [HExecuteSQLQuery](../WDLang4/3044084.md)). In this case, the *hWithFilter* constant is automatically selected.




Regardless of the runtime mode of the query (with or without the *hWithFilter* constant), adding records into a query is allowed for the single-file queries only. The calculated items specified during the addition are ignored. They are automatically calculated.

Caution:

- No addition is allowed in a query that uses groups or aggregates.

- The management of integrity and duplicates is not performed during the operations on the multi-file queries: it is recommended to use transactions to avoid any problems.

### Adding records into a view
<a name="adding_records_into_view_ELTPARAGRAPHE000361"></a>

You have the ability to add records into a view created on data files in HFSQL Classic format. These records are added in memory only. To add them into the data file linked to the view (simple view for example), you must use [HViewToFile](../WDLang4/3044021.md).
<a name="NOTE0_6"></a>


### Browsing and adding records
<a name="browsing_and_adding_records_ELTPARAGRAPHE000373"></a>You can configure the effect of adding a record during the browse of a data file (*hWriteDefault* and *hAffectBrowse* constants). The operating mode of the earlier versions can be kept by using the *hAffectBrowse* constant.
![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png)![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) **Special cases**: If the record is added during a browse, it will be visible in the current browse only. If other browse operations have been defined on this database, the new record will only be visible once these browse operations have been reinitialized.

### Slowness when adding or deleting a record for the first time in an HFSQL data file
<a name="slowness_when_adding_deleting_record_for_the_first_time_hfsql_data_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000385"></a>

Accessing a record in an HFSQL data file for the first time may take long. To fix this problem:

- Disable the antivirus for .FIC,.NDX,.MMO and.REP files.

- Disable the "Restore the system" option in Windows XP.

### Addition into a database in Hyper File 5.5 format
<a name="addition_into_database_hyper_file_55_format_ELTPARAGRAPHE000399"></a>

**If you are using HDuplicateRecord with a database in Hyper File 5.5 format:**

- The add options (&lt;Options&gt;) are ignored.

- The TEXT items are automatically filled with space characters.

- **HDuplicateRecord** cannot be used on a view created from Hyper File 5.5 data files.
