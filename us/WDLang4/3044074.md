<a name="description"></a>
Adds or modifies a trigger on an HFSQL data file. A trigger is a WLanguage procedure automatically called by the HFSQL engine whenever an HFSQL function is run. UPDATE, INSERT or DELETE queries also execute the trigger (Caution: the trigger is executed on tables accessed via a Native Connector). 

For more details, see [Managing triggers](../WDLang4/3044271.md). 

![HFSQL Classic](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HF.png)![HFSQL Client/Server](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HFCS.png) This function is only available on the client side. Use [HDescribeServerTrigger](../WDLang4/1000017033.md) to define a server trigger for an HFSQL Client/Server database.

## Example


```wl
// In the initialization code of the project
Local
	TriggerResult is boolean

// Create a trigger for all the analysis files
TriggerResult = HDescribeTrigger("*", "HADD,HMODIFY," + ...
			 "HDELETE, HCROSS,HWRITE", "CheckUserRights", hTriggerBefore)
// "CheckUserRights" is a global procedure of the project
IF TriggerResult = False THEN
	 Error("Error on a trigger: " + HErrorInfo)
	 RETURN
END
```

## Syntax

`<Result> = HDescribeTrigger(<List of HFSQL data files> , <List of HFSQL functions> , <WLanguage procedure> , <Type of trigger>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the operation was performed, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if a problem occurs. [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) is used to identify the error.




**`<List of HFSQL data files>: (Character string)`**

Logical name of one or more HFSQL data files. 
To specify several names of data files, the names of the data files must be separated by a comma (","). 
To use all the data files found in the analysis, this parameter must be equal to "\*".

**`<List of HFSQL functions>: (Character string)`**

Name of one or more HFSQL or TableXXX functions on which the trigger must be implemented. To specify several names of functions, the names of functions must be separated by a comma (","). You have the ability to define triggers on the following functions:

- [HModify](../WDLang4/3044042.md)

- [HAdd](../WDLang4/3044147.md)

- [HDelete](../WDLang4/3044018.md)

- [HWrite](../WDLang4/3044092.md)

- [HCross](../WDLang4/3044121.md)




**`<WLanguage procedure>: (Procedure name)`**

Name of the WLanguage procedure that will be run when a trigger is activated on the specified HFSQL functions.

**`<Type of trigger>: (Integer constant)`**

Indicates the type of trigger.


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hTriggerAfter* | The procedure is run after the HFSQL function. |
| *hTriggerBefore* | The procedure is run before the HFSQL function. |

## Remarks


### Trigger on the table management functions
<a name="trigger_the_table_management_functions_ELTPARAGRAPHE000133"></a>

The table management functions ([TableAdd](../WDLang1/3074017.md), [TableAddLine](../WDLang1/3074006.md), [TableDelete](../WDLang1/3074032.md), [TableModify](../WDLang1/3074019.md), ... ) implicitly use the following HFSQL functions: [HAdd](../WDLang4/3044147.md), [HDelete](../WDLang4/3044018.md) and [HModify](../WDLang4/3044042.md).

When using one of these functions for handling the tables, if a trigger is defined for the corresponding HFSQL function, the trigger is automatically activated.

### Variables used to manage the triggers
<a name="variables_used_manage_the_triggers_ELTPARAGRAPHE000165"></a>

A trigger procedure accepts no parameter. However, some HFSQL state variables are positioned before each call:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| H.Action | Character initialized to "A" for a Before trigger and to "P" for an After trigger. |
| H.FileName | Character string: Logical name of the data file whose trigger is activated |
| H.ToDo | During the execution of a before trigger:<br><br>- cancel the execution of the HFSQL function by assigning **"A"** to the HFSQL state variable: H.ToDo = "A". In this case, the action is not performed and the function (HAdd, HModify, etc.) returns <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> (no error).<br><br>- cancel the execution of the current HFSQL function by assigning **"E"** to the HFSQL state variable: H.ToDo = "E". In this case, the action is not performed and the function (HAdd, HModify, etc.) returns <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>. The error message is as follows: "The action on XXX file was interrupted by the trigger".<br><br><br> |
| H.TriggerFunction | Character string: Name of the HFSQL function that activated the trigger |


**Remark**: When a "BEFORE" trigger and an "AFTER" trigger are associated with an HFSQL function, if "BEFORE" cancels the execution of the HFSQL function (by setting H.ToDo to "A"), "AFTER" is not run.
