Stores a unique computer number or identifier in order to use the log and transactions in network. The computer corresponds to the user computer. 

By default, the computer is identified by a unique number and by the computer name (defined in Windows). To easily identify the computer that performs the operations in transaction, **HComputer** allows you to define an identifier specific to the computer. This optional identifier replaces the computer name and it can be viewed in [WDTrans](../WDTrans/3524005.md) and [WDLog](../WDJournal/3516012.md).

## Example

<a name="Example1"></a>



```wl
HComputer("45000")
```


<a name="Example2"></a>



```wl
// Assign the computer number read in "COMPUTERNUM" entry
// of "MYPROGRAM" section of "WIN.INI" file
ComputerNum is a string
ComputerNum = INIRead("MYPROGRAM", "COMPUTERNUM", "")
IF ComputerNum = "" THEN
	Error("Problem retrieving the computer number")
ELSE
	HComputer(ComputerNum)
END

## Syntax

`<Result> = HComputer(<Identifier>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the computer number was stored,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) returns more details about the problem.




**`<Identifier>: (Character string)`**

Identifies the current computer (up to 16 characters). This identifier can be viewed in WDTrans and WDLog. This identifier corresponds to the name of the client computer (returned by [NetMachineName](../WDLang3/3056014.md)) or to the name of the computer where the data files are located (for a remote analysis).

## Remarks


- In most cases, **HComputer** is used in network in association with a parameter file found on the local computer and indicating its number.

- **HComputer** is useless if the data files do not have a log and/or if they are not the source of a transaction.

- If **HComputer** is used after [HTransactionStart](../WDLang4/3044002.md), the computer number will be modified for the next operations performed.

- This function is not available when using a database via .
