<a name="Use"></a>
<a name="description"></a>
Defines and enables a "Contains" filter on a data file, view or query. The "Contains" filter is used to select all the records containing a specific set of characters.

This filter is not case sensitive.

This filter does not use any index, it browses the entire data file.

## Example


```wl
SearchKey is string = HFilterContains(Customer, Comment, "VIP")	
HReadFirst(Customer, SearchKey)
WHILE NOT HOut()
	Trace(Customer.CustomerName, Customer.City)
	HReadNext(Customer, SearchKey)
END
// Disables the filter
HDeactivateFilter(Customer)
```

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = HFilterContains(<Data file> , <Item> , <Value>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Character string)`**

Browse item. Corresponds to: 

- the name of item used to loop through the data file if the filter is enabled, 

- an empty string ("") if the filter cannot be implemented. 




**`<Data file>: (Character string)`**

Name of the HFSQL data file, view or query used.

**`<Item>: (Character string)`**

Name of item on which the filter will be implemented. This item can be a key item or a non-key item. 

**`<Value>: (Character string)`**

Value that must be found in the record item.

## Remarks


### Filter
<a name="filter_ELTPARAGRAPHE000085"></a>

- The filter is enabled as soon as **HFilterContains** is called.

- Equivalent syntaxes: 
	
	```wl
	HFilterContains(FileName, ItemName, "Value")
	```

	is equivalent to: 
	
	```wl
	HFilter(FileName, "ItemName ~]'Value'")
	```

### Filtered browse
<a name="filtered_browse_ELTPARAGRAPHE000113"></a>

When a filter is defined and enabled on a data file, any record read corresponds to the filter. If no other record corresponds to the filter during the iteration:

- [HOut](../WDLang4/3044094.md) returns <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>. 

- the current record corresponds to the last record read with the filter.




For example:

| On a filtered data file, after the function: | the current record is: |
| --- | --- |
| **[HReadFirst](../WDLang4/3044051.md)** | the first file record corresponding to the filter. |
| **[HReadLast](../WDLang4/3044140.md)** | the last file record corresponding to the filter. |
| **[HReadNext](../WDLang4/3044037.md)** (or **[HForward](../WDLang4/3044154.md)**) | the next record (or the next nth record) corresponding to the filter. |
| **[HReadPrevious](../WDLang4/3044048.md)** (or **[HBackward](../WDLang4/3044126.md)**) | the previous record (or the previous nth record) corresponding to the filter. |

### Enabling/Disabling a filter
<a name="enablingdisabling_filter_ELTPARAGRAPHE000172"></a>

- [HDeactivateFilter](../WDLang4/3044085.md) is used to disable a filter.

- [HActivateFilter](../WDLang4/3044158.md) is used to re-enable a filter.

- The filter is deleted when the data file (query or view) is closed ([HClose](../WDLang4/3044073.md) or [HOpenAnalysis](../WDLang4/3044106.md) for example).

- A single filter can exist at a given time on a data file (query or view). If **HFilterContains** is used several times, only the last filter will be taken into account: the previous filters will be deleted. Similarly, if several filters are used (HFilter\* functions), only the last filter will be taken into account.
