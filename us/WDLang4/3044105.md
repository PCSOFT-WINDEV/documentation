Defines and enables a filter used to find the exact value of a string item. This filter can be used on a data file, a view or a query.

After its execution, the most common cases are as follows:

- the filter cannot be created: **HFilterIdentical** returns an empty string (""). [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) returns the error identifier.

- the filter is created: **HFilterIdentical** returns the optimized search key that will be used to loop through the data file, view or query.

## Example


```wl
// Select all the customers whose last name is Archambault 
// and whose first name is Colin
SearchKey is string
SearchKey = HFilterIdentical(Customer, LastNameFirstName, "Archambault", "Colin")
HReadFirst(Customer, SearchKey)
WHILE NOT HOut()
	Trace(Customer.CustomerName, Customer.City)
	HReadNext(Customer, SearchKey)
END
// Disables the filter
HDeactivateFilter(Customer)
```

## Syntax

`<Result> = HFilterIdentical(<Data file> , <Key item> , <Value for key component 1> [, <Value for key component 2> [... [, <Value for key component N>]]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Character string)`**

Browse item. Corresponds to:

- the search key of data file if the filter is enabled.

- an empty string ("") if the filter cannot be implemented.




**`<Data file>: (Character string)`**

Name of the HFSQL data file, view or query used.

**`<Key item>: (Character string)`**

Name of key item onto which the filter will be applied. This item can be a simple key (string) or a composite key. Caution: this parameter must only contain letters, underlined characters or digits. Otherwise, the name must be enclosed in quotes.

**`<Value for key component 1>: (Type of each component of the search key)`**

Value sought for the first component of composite key. 
The type of this parameter must correspond to the type of key item component on which the filter is defined.

**`<Value for key component 2>: (Type of each component of the search key)`**

Value sought for the second component of the composite key. 
The type of this parameter must correspond to the type of key item component on which the filter is defined.



**`<Value for key component N>: (Type of each component of the search key)`**

Value sought for component N of composite key . 
The type of this parameter must correspond to the type of key item component on which the filter is defined.

## Remarks


### Automatic management of composite keys
<a name="automatic_management_composite_keys_ELTPARAGRAPHE000117"></a>

**HFilterIdentical** automatically manages the filters on the simple keys and on the composite keys.

Example: Using **HFilterIdentical** with a simple key:

```wl
Res = HFilterIdentical(Customer, LastName, "Archambault")
// Select the customer whose last name is Archambault
```


Example: Using **HFilterIdentical** with a composite key

```wl
Res = HFilterIdentical(Customer, LastNameFirstName, "Archambault", "Colin")
// Select all the customers whose last name is Archambault and 
// whose first name is Colin
```
This line of code is equivalent to:

```wl
HFilter(Customer, LastNameFirstName, ...
	HBuildKeyValue(Customer, LastNameFirstName, "Archambault", "Colin"), ...   
	HBuildKeyValue(Customer, LastNameFirstName, "Archambault", "Colin")
```

<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Filter and filtered iteration
<a name="filter_and_filtered_iteration_ELTPARAGRAPHE000155"></a>

After the call to **HFilterIdentical**, the iteration must be performed on the item returned by **HFilterIdentical**. The filter will be ignored if another item is used to loop through the data file.

When a filter is defined and enabled on a data file (view or query), all records read correspond to the filter. If no other record corresponds to the filter during the iteration: 

- [HOut](../WDLang4/3044094.md) returns <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>. 

- the current record corresponds to the last record read with the filter. 




For example:

| On a filtered data file, after the function: | the current record is: |
| --- | --- |
| **[HReadFirst](../WDLang4/3044051.md)** | the first file record corresponding to the filter. |
| **[HReadLast](../WDLang4/3044140.md)** | the last file record corresponding to the filter. |
| **[HReadNext](../WDLang4/3044037.md)** (or **[HForward](../WDLang4/3044154.md)**) | the next record (or the next nth record) corresponding to the filter. |
| **[HReadPrevious](../WDLang4/3044048.md)** (or **[HBackward](../WDLang4/3044126.md)**) | the previous record (or the previous nth record) corresponding to the filter. |

### Enabling/Disabling a filter
<a name="enablingdisabling_filter_ELTPARAGRAPHE000220"></a>

- [HDeactivateFilter](../WDLang4/3044085.md) is used to disable a filter.

- [HActivateFilter](../WDLang4/3044158.md) is used to re-enable a filter.

- The filter is deleted when the data file (query or view) is closed ([HClose](../WDLang4/3044073.md) or [HOpenAnalysis](../WDLang4/3044106.md) for example).

- A single filter can exist at a given time on a data file (query or view). If **HFilterIdentical** is used several times, only the last filter will be taken into account: the previous filters will be deleted. Similarly, if several filters are used (HFilter\* functions), only the last filter will be taken into account.

### Data file not in HFSQL format
<a name="data_file_not_hfsql_format_ELTPARAGRAPHE000246"></a>

- The filter can be created from any item (key or non-key item).

- The filter is automatically enabled when **HFilterIdentical** is executed.

- The changes made with **HFilterIdentical** and [HDeactivateFilter](../WDLang4/3044085.md) are only taken into account when the following functions are used [HReadFirst](../WDLang4/3044051.md)/[HFirst](../WDLang4/3044113.md), [HReadLast](../WDLang4/3044140.md)/[HLast](../WDLang4/3044101.md) or [HReadSeekFirst](../WDLang4/3044036.md)/[HReadSeekLast](../WDLang4/3044034.md).
