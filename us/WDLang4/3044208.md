## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000082"></a>
An analysis can be shared between an application developed with an earlier WINDEV version (7.5 to 26) and a WINDEV 28 application. Indeed, the analysis structure is identical between these versions.

### Steps to follow
<a name="steps_follow_ELTPARAGRAPHE000020"></a>

To perform modifications in an analysis shared between a WINDEV 7.5 application and a WINDEV 28 application, we recommend that you follow these steps:

1. Perform the requested modifications in the data model editor of WINDEV 7.5 (especially for the "Shared information").

2. Generate the analysis.

3. Open the project that is using the same analysis in WINDEV 28.




**Remarks**:

- The new features of WINDEV 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 or 26 (NULL values supported, for example) will not be taken into account.

- The modification of the "Shared Info" of the analysis in WINDEV 8 or later makes the "RAD Info" unreadable in WINDEV 7.5.
