<a name="description"></a>
Crosses a record in a data file. The record is deleted logically and it can be retrieved if necessary.

The following operations are performed:

- the record becomes inactive. The data is stored (which is not the case when a record is deleted by [HDelete](../WDLang4/3044018.md)).

- the indexes (corresponding to the record keys) are deleted from the index file.

- the memos associated with the record are stored.




This function can be used on the data files, the HFSQL Mobile views or the queries.

## Example

<a name="Example1"></a>

```wl
// Crosses the record #123
HCross(Customer, 123)
```
<a name="Example2"></a>

```wl
// Cross the customer orders
HReadSeekFirst(ORDERS, CUSTNUM, ValCustNum)
WHILE HFound() = True
	HCross()
	HReadNext()
END
```

## Syntax

`<Result> = HCross([<Data file> [, <Record number> [, <Options>]]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the record was crossed,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if an error occurred (locked record, integrity error, ...). [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) returns more details.




**`<Data file>: (Optional character string)`**

Name of HFSQL data file, query or view used. 
If this parameter is an empty string (""), **HCross** manipulates the last data file used by the last HFSQL function (function starting with "H").

**`<Record number>: (Optional integer)`**

Number of the record to cross. 
If this parameter is not specified (equal to 0 or to the *hCurrentRecNum* constant), the current record will be crossed.

**`<Options>: (Optional constant)`**

Configures:

- the lock mode applied to the crossed record. If no lock constant is specified, the crossed record is not locked.
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hLockNo*<br>(default value) | No lock: the crossed record will not be locked. |
| *hLockReadWrite* | Lock in read/write: the current crossed record cannot be read or re-enabled by another application. |
| *hLockWrite* | Lock in write mode: another application can read and consult the current crossed record ([HRead](../WDLang4/3044047.md)) but cannot re-enable it. Only the current application can re-enable it. |



- the integrity management applied to the crossed record.
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hCheckIntegrity* | Checks the integrity for the operation, even if the automatic integrity check is disabled ([HSetIntegrity](../WDLang4/3044058.md)). |
| *hIgnoreIntegrity* | Ignores the integrity check for this operation, even if the automatic integrity check is enabled ([HSetIntegrity](../WDLang4/3044058.md)). |


	A WLanguage error occurs if the two constants are used at the same time. These constants have no effect on the cascading deletion.

## Remarks


### Handling a crossed record
<a name="handling_crossed_record_ELTPARAGRAPHE000172"></a>

- A crossed record will not be read:

	- by iteration functions: [HFirst](../WDLang4/3044113.md), [HLast](../WDLang4/3044101.md), [HNext](../WDLang4/3044027.md), [HPrevious](../WDLang4/3044112.md), [HReadFirst](../WDLang4/3044051.md), [HReadLast](../WDLang4/3044140.md), [HReadNext](../WDLang4/3044037.md), [HReadPrevious](../WDLang4/3044048.md), [HForward](../WDLang4/3044154.md), [HBackward](../WDLang4/3044126.md)

	- by the search functions: [HSeekFirst](../WDLang4/3044125.md), [HReadSeekFirst](../WDLang4/3044036.md), [HSeekLast](../WDLang4/3044129.md), [HReadSeekLast](../WDLang4/3044034.md).




- A crossed record can be read by [HRead](../WDLang4/3044047.md).

- A crossed record can be re-enabled by [HModify](../WDLang4/3044042.md) or [HWrite](../WDLang4/3044092.md).

- [HState](../WDLang4/3044081.md) is used to find out the record status (active, crossed, deleted, etc.).

- The physical location of a crossed record can only be reused (by [HAdd](../WDLang4/3044147.md) for example) after:

	- the execution of [HFree](../WDLang4/3044064.md),

	- a reindex operation (with compression).






<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Number of crossed records
<a name="number_crossed_records_ELTPARAGRAPHE000249"></a>

[HNbRec](../WDLang4/3044006.md) is used to find out the number of crossed records in the data file.

Remark: For backward compatibility with WEBDEV 1.5/WINDEV 5.5, the number of crossed records can also be returned by the *H.NbDel* variable.
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Version of data file
<a name="version_data_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000262"></a>

If **HCross** is successful, the data file version number is modified. This version number is returned by [HVersion](../WDLang4/3044020.md).
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Crossing a record from a query
<a name="crossing_record_from_query_ELTPARAGRAPHE000276"></a>

A record can be crossed:

- in the query result.

- in the files handled by the query (*hModifyFile* constant used in [HExecuteQuery](../WDLang4/3044080.md) or [HExecuteSQLQuery](../WDLang4/3044084.md)). In this case, the *hWithFilter* constant is automatically selected.




Regardless of the query execution mode (with or without the *hWithFilter* constant), **HCross** can only be used on single-file queries.

Caution: 

- Records cannot be crossed in a query that uses groups or aggregates.

- The management of integrity and duplicates is not performed during the operations on the multi-file queries: it is recommended to use transactions to avoid any problems.



<a name="NOTE0_5"></a>


### Special cases
<a name="special_cases_ELTPARAGRAPHE000303"></a>

- **Managing locks**: 
	If a lock problem occurs when "crossing" a record (attempt to cross a record locked in write mode for example), the record is not modified and [HErrorLock](../WDLang4/3044099.md) returns <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>.

- **Managing the referential integrity**
	If the management of the referential integrity is enabled ([HSetIntegrity](../WDLang4/3044058.md)) and if the integrity is not checked during the deletion, **HCross** is not run. [HErrorIntegrity](../WDLang4/3044086.md) must be checked after **HCross**.

- **Deleted records**
	**HCross** must not be called on a record that was deleted beforehand.

### xBase files
<a name="xbase_files_ELTPARAGRAPHE000341"></a>

[HDelete](../WDLang4/3044018.md) and **HCross** have the same effect: the record is crossed but it is not deleted. Therefore, the record can be re-enabled using [HModify](../WDLang4/3044042.md). In this case, [HState](../WDLang4/3044081.md) returns the *hStateCrossed* constant for a deleted record (instead of *hStateDel*).
