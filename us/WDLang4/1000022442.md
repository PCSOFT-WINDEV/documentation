The following functions are used to manage MongoDB databases and GridFS:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [MongoAdd](../WDLang4/1000022432.md) | Adds one or more documents into a collection of MongoDB database. |
| [MongoAggregationPipeline](../WDLang4/1000025267.md) | Used to retrieve documents that enter a multi-stage pipeline and are transformed into aggregated results. |

| [MongoDeleteAll](../WDLang4/1000022445.md) | Deletes all the documents (corresponding to the specified filter) from a collection of a MongoDB database. |
| [MongoDeleteCollection](../WDLang4/1000022558.md) | Deletes a collection from a MongoDB database. |
| [MongoDeleteDatabase](../WDLang4/1000022444.md) | Deletes a MongoDB database as well as its collections. |
| [MongoDeleteOne](../WDLang4/1000022446.md) | Deletes a document from a collection in a MongoDB database. |

| [MongoGridFSGetFile](../WDLang4/1000022439.md) | Retrieves (on the local computer) a file identified by its name and found in a MongoDB file system. |
| [MongoGridFSGetFileByID](../WDLang4/1000022595.md) | Retrieves (on the local computer) a file identified by its identifier and found in a MongoDB file system. |
| [MongoGridFSGetFileInfo](../WDLang4/1000023495.md) | Allows you to get information about a MongoDB file (gridFS). |
| [MongoGridFSListFile](../WDLang4/1000022438.md) | Retrieves the list of MongoDB files found in the MongoDB file system (gridFS). |
| [MongoGridFSSendFile](../WDLang4/1000022436.md) | Copies a file from the local computer to a MongoDB file system (gridFS). |
| [MongoInfo](../WDLang4/1000022441.md) | Returns information about a MongoDB database. |
| [MongoModifyAll](../WDLang4/1000022603.md) | Modifies documents in a collection of a MongoDB database. |
| [MongoModifyOne](../WDLang4/1000022443.md) | Modifies a document in a collection of MongoDB database. |
