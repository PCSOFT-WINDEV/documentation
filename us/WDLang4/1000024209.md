Creates an HFSQL view.

**Remark**: To merge several views, use [&lt;Source&gt;.MergeView](../WDLang4/1000024983.md).

**Reminder**: An HFSQL view corresponds to a "memory image" of a data file. A view is stored in memory, which insulates it from the modifications made to the associated data file. Once created, a view can be handled like any HFSQL data file.

## Example


```wl
// Create a view
MyView is Data Source
MyView.CreateView(Customer, "*", "Name,City", "Name]='A'", hViewDefault)

## Syntax

### Creating a view on a data file (data file described in the analysis or created through programming)

`<Result> = <View to create>.CreateView(<Data file> [, <Items> [, <Sort items> [, <Selection condition>]]] [, <Creation mode> [, <Page size>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the view was created,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if a problem occurs. [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) is used to identify the error.




**`<View to create>: (Data source)`**

View to create. A Data Source variable is used to optimize the access time to the view items.

**`<Data file>: (Character string)`**

Name of the data file used. This data file can correspond to a data file described in the analysis or through programming ([&lt;Source&gt;.DescribeFile](../WDLang4/1000024215.md)). You also have the ability to use a [data source](../WDLang4/1514053.md).

**`<Items>: (Optional character string)`**

List of items in the view. In this list, the different items are separated by commas or by CR characters (Carriage Return). 
If this parameter is not specified or if it corresponds to "\*", the items found in the data file will be included in the view.

**`<Sort items>: (Optional character string)`**

List of sort items for the view. In this list, the sort items are separated by commas or by CR characters (Carriage Return). The sort is performed according to the order of the items in the list. 
The sort direction can be specified for each item: 

- a "+" sign in front of the item name indicates an ascending sort order. 

- a "-" sign in front of the item name indicates a descending sort order. 




If this parameter is not specified or is an empty string (""), no sort is defined in the view.
![Hyper File 5.5](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HF55.png) A single sort item must be specified in &lt;Sort items&gt;.

**`<Selection condition>: (Optional character string)`**

Selection condition of records. All items found in the data file can be included in the condition (key or non-key items). 
No selection condition is applied if this parameter is not specified or if it corresponds to an empty string. This selection condition can be an Ansi or Unicode character string.

**`<Creation mode>: (Optional Integer constant (combination of constants))`**

Configures the creation mode of view.


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hViewAdd* | Stores the content of the view next time [&lt;Source&gt;.ExecuteView](../WDLang4/1000024949.md) is called. |
| *hViewBreakable* | Interrupt view creation by pressing the ESC key.<br>![HFSQL Client/Server](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HFCS.png) This constant is not available. |
| *hViewDefault* | Default view creation mode |
| *hViewDistinct* | The view is created and the duplicates are deleted according to the sort key (in this case, the sort items **must** be specified).<br>If several items are specified, the duplicates are deleted according to the composition of the specified sort items.<br>![Hyper File 5.5](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HF55.png) If the *hViewDistinct* constant is specified, there is no need to specify a sort item in &lt;Sort items&gt;. In this case, the *hViewDistinct* constant is ignored. |
| *hViewExclusive* | Lock the entire source file to reduce the view creation time. |
| *hViewLocking* | The records read in the data file and included in the view are locked.<br> |
| *hViewPostponed* | The view is created, but it will be run later by [&lt;Source&gt;.ExecuteView](../WDLang4/1000024949.md). The data found in the view will be the data found during the execution of the view. |



**`<Page size>: (Optional integer)`**

Number of records per page (for a view used by remote access).
![HFSQL Client/Server](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HFCS.png) This parameter is ignored.

## Remarks


### Selection condition
<a name="selection_condition_ELTPARAGRAPHE000319"></a>

The general syntax of a condition has the following format:

"CustName&gt;'Smith' and ZipCode=34 or ZipCode=32"

The supported operators depend on the type of items used in the condition:


|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| &lt;&gt; | Not equal to | Valid for all types |
| &gt; | Greater than | Valid for all types |
| &gt;= | Greater than or equal to | Valid for all types |
| &lt; | Less than | Valid for all types |
| &lt;= | Less than or equal to | Valid for all types |
| = | Strictly equal to | Valid for all types |
| ~= | Almost equal to: ignores the space characters on the right, the accented characters, the lowercase and uppercase characters | Valid for string types only |
| ~~ | Very flexible equality: does not distinguish between lowercase and uppercase characters, ignores the space characters found before and after the string to test, ignores the lowercase accented characters, ignores the space characters and the punctuation characters inside the strings. | Valid for string types only |
| ] | Contains: takes the lowercase and uppercase characters into account | Valid for string types only |
| ~] | Contains: ignores the lowercase and uppercase characters | Valid for string types only |
| ]= | Starts with: takes the lowercase and uppercase characters into account | Valid for string types only |


**Remarks on the selection condition:**

- Constant strings must be enclosed in single quotes.

- The item name must only contain letters, digits and underscore characters ("_"). If the item name contains other characters (quotes, etc.), it must be enclosed in double quotes. 
	For example: "e_mail@"]'com'

- Comparisons between strings are performed according to the ASCII value of the characters and not according to the lexicographic value ('a' > 'Z').

- The binary memos and the composite keys cannot be part of a selection condition.

- If a &lt;*string constant&gt;* contains a simple quote (or a double quote), this simple quote (or double quote) must be preceded by a backslash character (\\).

- To optimize the browse, use [&lt;Source&gt;.StatCalculate](../WDLang4/1000025064.md) on the data file before creating the view. Indeed, the HFSQL engine analyzes the selection condition and it uses these statistics to define the most discriminating items that will be used to optimize the browse operations performed on the data files.

- This selection condition can be an Ansi or Unicode character string.

### Creating a view on a filtered data file
<a name="creating_view_filtered_data_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000428"></a>

**&lt;Source&gt;.CreateView** takes into account the filter set on the source data file.

This characteristic is supported by the views created from HFSQL Classic or Client/Server, Hyper File 5.5 and xBase data files.
