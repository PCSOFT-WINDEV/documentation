The **Connection** type is used to describe one or more connections to external databases (HFSQL Client/Server, Native Connector, etc.). Then, this connection can be opened with [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md). The characteristics of this connection can be defined and changed by [several WLanguage properties](#NOTE0_1).



The **Connection** variable can also be used to:

- describe a new connection (equivalent to [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md)).

- create a connection (that will be opened by [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md)).

- modify an existing connection.




**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

## Example


```wl
MyConnection is Connection

// Describe the connection
MyConnection.User = "USER"
MyConnection.Password = "PASSWORD"
MyConnection.Server = "MYSERVER" 
MyConnection.Database = "Database"
MyConnection.Provider = hAccessHFClientServer
MyConnection.Access = hOReadWrite
MyConnection.ExtendedInfo = "Extended information"
MyConnection.CursorOptions = hClientCursor

// Open the connection
HOpenConnection(MyConnection)

// Assign the connection to all data files
HChangeConnection("*", MyConnection)
```

### WLanguage properties that can be used with a connection described through programming
<a name="wlanguage_properties_that_can_used_with_connection_described_through_programming_ELTPARAGRAPHE000066"></a>

The properties specific to the connections are presented in the table below:

Remark: The **Provider** and **Server** properties, or **Provider** and **Source** properties must be initialized in the description of a connection.

| Property name | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| [Access](../Proprietes/2512100.md) | Allows you to manage the type of access for a connection (HFSQL Client/Server, OLE DB, ...): Read, Read/Write |
| [ActiveDirectory](../Proprietes/1000023438.md) | Used to manage the connection via Active Directory. |
| [Database](../Proprietes/2512101.md) | Allows you to manage the name of the database associated with a connection (HFSQL Client/Server, OLE DB, ...).<br><br>In the case of a database divided into schemas, the name of the schema in the database will be specified by [HChangeName](../WDLang4/3044141.md). |
| [Compression](../Proprietes/1000017276.md) | Allows you to manage the compression of data transmitted by the connection. |
| [Encryption](../Proprietes/2512102.md) | Allows you to manage the type of encryption for the communication between the Client computers and the HFSQL server. |
| [ExtendedInfo](../Proprietes/2512041.md) | Allows you to manage the additional information of a connection. |
| [Caption](../Proprietes/2510053.md) | Allows you to find out and modify the caption of a connection. |
| [Password](../Proprietes/2510086.md) | Allows you to modify the password associated with the user of a connection. |
| [Name](../Proprietes/2510082.md) | Allows you to find out the name of the connection |
| [CursorOptions](../Proprietes/2512103.md) | Allows you to manage the different types of cursors used by the connection. |
| [Provider](../Proprietes/2512104.md) | Allows you to manage the type of data handled by the connection. |
| [Server](../Proprietes/2512105.md) | Allows you to manage the name of the server used in the connection. This property is equivalent to the [Source](../Proprietes/2510147.md) property. This property is mainly used for the HFSQL Client/Server connections or for the Native Accesses on the servers. <br><br>![HFSQL Client/Server](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HFCS.png) You have the ability to specify an IPv6 address by writing the IPv6 address between square brackets. In this case, the port number must be specified after the closing square bracket. For example: [0154:2145:2155::5554]:4900. |
| [Source](../Proprietes/2510147.md) | Allows you to manage the name of the data source used in the connection. This property is equivalent to the [Server](../Proprietes/2512105.md) property. This property is mainly used for a connection on MS Access or on an xBase file. |
| [CacheSize](../Proprietes/2512106.md) | Allows you to manage the size of the cache |
| [User](../Proprietes/2512107.md) | Allows you to manage the user of the connection |

### Native Oracle Connector: managing the external authentication
<a name="native_oracle_connector_managing_the_external_authentication_ELTPARAGRAPHE000176"></a>

To connect via an external authentication: 

- the **User** property must correspond to "/" (slash)

- the **Password** property must correspond to "" (empty string)




Remark: The external authentication consists in using the name of Windows user and his password to connect to the database. The external authentication requires configuring the server. See the Oracle documentation to learn more about how to authorize external authentications on the server.
