## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000169"></a>
You have the ability to index the content of a text memo item. The size of the text memos being quite important, the mechanism of partial indexing is used for the memos.

The partial indexing of the text memos is used to define the number of characters that will be indexed in the text memo. This mechanism is used to optimize the size of the indexes and the search speed.

For example, if the content of an invoice (found in a text memo) is indexed, you will not necessarily have to index for each invoice the three pages of general sales conditions that follow the useful data.

## How to partially index the text memos?
<a name="how_partially_index_the_text_memos_ELTTEXTE000193"></a>
The indexing of text memos can be performed:

- in the data model editor (for the data files described in the analysis)

- in WLanguage for the data files created through programming.

### Implementing the indexing of text memos in the data model editor
<a name="implementing_the_indexing_text_memos_the_data_model_editor_ELTPARAGRAPHE000046"></a>

To implement the indexing of text memos:

1. In the data model editor, display the description of the items found in a data file containing a text memo.

2. Select the item associated with a text memo.

3. In the right section of screen, you have the ability to specify whether the memo must be a key or not: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Indexation%20des%20m%E9mos%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)


4. Specify:

	- the type of partial key: not key, unique key or key with duplicates.

	- the iteration direction: ascending or descending.

	- the size of the indexed part of the memo. This size must be specified in number of characters.

	- whether the search must be sensitive to the case, to the accented characters and to the space characters. 




5. Validate.  

6. Generate the analysis. If data files have been already used, an automatic modification of the data files is performed.

### Implement the indexing of text memos through programming
<a name="implement_the_indexing_text_memos_through_programming_ELTPARAGRAPHE000066"></a>

To implement the indexing of text memos when describing a data file through programming, all you have to do is use the available WLanguage properties on the items to specify the characteristics of text memo key.

| Property name | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| [Name](../Proprietes/2510082.md) | Item name |
| [AccentSensitive](../Proprietes/2512077.md) | Take the accented characters into account when performing searches on the item. |
| [CaseSensitive](../Proprietes/2512085.md) | Take the case (uppercase/lowercase characters) into account when performing searches on the item. |
| [PunctuationSensitive](../Proprietes/2512087.md) | Take the punctuation characters (comma, period, ...) into account when performing searches on the item. |
| [Size](../Proprietes/2510125.md) | Size of a text item (character string, text memo, character). |
| [KeySize](../Proprietes/1000017277.md) | Size of the section to index in the text memo. |
| [Type](../Proprietes/2510131.md) | Identifies and modifies the type of an item. |
| [KeyType](../Proprietes/2512060.md) | Characteristics of a key item. |
| [SortType](../Proprietes/2512091.md) | Characteristics of the sort on an item. |

Example:


```wl
MyMemoIndex is Item Description
MyMemoIndex.Name = "Comments"
MyMemoIndex.Type = hItemTextMemo
MyMemoIndex.KeyType = hUniqueKey
MyMemoIndex.SortType = hIncreasing
MyMemoIndex.AccentSensitive = False
MyMemoIndex.CaseSensitive = False
MyMemoIndex.PunctuationSensitive = False
MyMemoIndex.KeySize = 50
HDescribeItem(Book, MyMemoIndex)
```
