The **Record** type is used to handle (modify, save, ...) the values of a record. This record can be a record found in a data file, a query or a view. The variable associated with the **Record** type will be structured like a record of the database. 

Usage example: This allows you to store in different variables the content of several records in order to compare them or to compare some items. 


<a name="Example1"></a>
<a name="sample_code"></a>

## Example


```wl
// CUSTOMER is a data file described in the analysis
CustomerRec is Record of CUSTOMER

HReadFirst(CUSTOMER, CUSTNUM)
IF NOT HOut() THEN
	CustomerRec = CUSTOMER
	// Display the last and first names of the customer 
	Info(CustomerRec.LASTNAME, CustomerRec.FIRSTNAME)
END
```


<a name="Example2"></a>

```wl
// CUSTOMER is a data file described in the analysis
CustomerRec is Record of CUSTOMER

CustomerRec.LastName = "MOORE"
CustomerRec.FirstName = "Paul"
CustomerRec.City = "PARIS"

// Assigns the content of the CustomerRec variable in the buffer of Customer data file
CUSTOMER = CustomerRec  

HAdd(CUSTOMER)

// You have the ability to do: HAdd(CUSTOMER, CustomerRec)
```

### Declaring a Record variable
<a name="declaring_record_variable_ELTPARAGRAPHE000042"></a>

The following syntax is used to declare a **Record** variable: 


```txt
<Variable name> is Record [of <Name of data file in the analysis>]
```


- If &lt;Name of data file in the analysis&gt; is specified, the record is associated with a description of one of the data files in the analysis. In this case, you have the ability to handle the different record items. 

- If &lt;Name of data file in the analysis&gt; is not specified, the structure of the record will be built dynamically according to the buffer of the file allocated to it.

### Accessing the items
<a name="accessing_the_items_ELTPARAGRAPHE000054"></a>

To access the items of a **Record** variable, use the following syntax: 

- To assign an item of the variable: 
	
	```txt
	<Variable name>.<Item name> = <Value to assign>
	```


- To retrieve the value of the items: 
	
	```txt
	<Value> = <Variable name>.<Item name>
	```





**Remark**: When using a **record** variable associated with a data file of the analysis, the code editor automatically proposes the different record items:

### Reading and assigning a Record variable
<a name="reading_and_assigning_record_variable_ELTPARAGRAPHE000072"></a>

A **Record** variable can be read or assigned. The syntax is as follows: 

- To store the buffer of a data file in a **Record** variable: 
	
	```txt
	<Name of Record variable> = <Name of data file>
	```


- To assign the buffer of a data file from a **Record** variable: 
	
	```txt
	<Name of data file> = <Name of Record variable>
	```





Remark: Assigning a variable of type **Record** to a data file modifies the [NewRecord](../Proprietes/1000017090.md) property.

### Special cases
<a name="special_cases_ELTPARAGRAPHE000091"></a>

- [HRecordToString](../WDLang4/1000025983.md) used on a **Record** variable returns a character string containing the value of each item separated by a TAB character.

- No compilation error occurs if a **Record** variable with type on a data file is assigned with the buffer of another data file. An homonymic copy of buffers is performed: only the items with the same name of each buffer will be assigned. The other items will be not assigned.

- Only JSON serialization is available for this type of variable ([Serialize](../WDLang1/3013065.md)). No deserialization is possible.

### Functions that handle the Record type
<a name="functions_that_handle_the_record_type_ELTPARAGRAPHE000105"></a>The following functions use the **Record** type: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [HAdd](../WDLang4/3044147.md) | Adds: <br><br>- the record found in memory into the data file (query or view). <br><br>- the record found in a [Record](../WDLang4/1000020962.md) variable into the data file (query or view).<br><br><br> |
| [HCopyRecord](../WDLang4/3044261.md) | Copies: <br><br>- the content of the current record (loaded in memory) to the current data file record.<br><br>- the content of the [Record](../WDLang4/1000020962.md) variable to the current data file record.<br><br><br> |
| [HExtractMemo](../WDLang4/3044072.md) | Extracts the content of a binary memo item from an HFSQL file, a query or an HFSQL view to a physical file (on disk). |
| [HInfoMemo](../WDLang4/3044008.md) | Returns the characteristics of binary and text memos. |
| [HLinkMemo](../WDLang4/3044173.md) | Used to associate a file with a binary memo item or to cancel the existing link between a file and a binary item. |
| [HListItem](../WDLang4/3044230.md) | Returns the list of items:<br><br>- found in a data file ( a query or a view) known to the HFSQL engine. The data files defined by [HDeclare](../WDLang4/3044203.md), [HDeclareExternal](../WDLang4/3044204.md) and [HDescribeFile](../WDLang4/3044206.md) are taken into account.<br><br>- found in a Record variable. <br><br><br> |
| [HRecordToString](../WDLang4/1000025983.md) | Converts the content of the current record to string (in a data file, HFSQL view, query, etc.). |
| [HReset](../WDLang4/3044118.md) | Initializes: <br><br>- one or all variables of file items with their default values. <br><br>- one or all items of a [Record](../WDLang4/1000020962.md) variable with their default values. <br><br><br> |





Remark: You can also use [VariableReset](../WDLang1/3013069.md) to reset the contents of a variable of type **Record**.

### Properties specific to Record variables
<a name="properties_specific_record_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000120"></a>

The following properties can be used to find out the characteristics of a **Record** variable:

| **Property name** | **Type used** | **Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AssociatedFile | Character string | Name of the HFSQL data file on which the variable is based. <br><br>**This property is read-only**. |
| Content | Character string | Content of the current record (identical to the result returned by [HRecordToString](../WDLang4/1000025983.md)). <br><br>**This property is read-only**. |
