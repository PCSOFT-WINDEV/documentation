<a name="description"></a>
Describes a new connection to an external database. This connection is named. Specific parameters can be defined such as the management mode of cursors (if the accessed database allows it).

To associate this connection with a table or a data file, use [HChangeConnection](../WDLang4/3044150.md).

To open the connection, use [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md). If the connection parameters described by **HDescribeConnection** are incorrect, [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md) will return an error.

With **HDescribeConnection**, an Oracle table description imported into the analysis can be directly used by HFSQL Classic data files. Simply describe a temporary connection to an HFSQL Classic database and associate it with the file description from in the analysis. See the Examples for more details.

**This function is kept for backward compatibility**. We recommend that you use a [Connection variable and its properties](../WDLang4/1514073.md) to describe a connection.

## Syntax

### Describing a connection through programming

`<Result> = HDescribeConnection(<Connection> , <User> [, <Password>] , <Data source> , <Database> , <OLE DB provider or Native Connector> [, <Access> [, <Extended information>]] , <Additional options>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the operation was performed, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if a problem occurs. [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) is used to identify the error. 




To establish this connection, use [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md) (this function will return an error if the connection parameters are incorrect). 

To assign this connection to a data file, use [HChangeConnection](../WDLang4/3044150.md).

**`<Connection>: (Character string)`**

Name of new connection to define. 

If this name is already used by an existing connection, the former connection is replaced with the new one. The former connection (as well as the data files that used it) are automatically closed.

**`<User>: (Character string)`**

Username used for the database. This parameter is returned by the [CtUserName](../Proprietes/2512026.md) property.

**`<Password>: (Optional character string)`**

Connection password (if this password exists). If no password is required, use an empty string ("") or the NULL keyword.

**`<Data source>: (Character string)`**

Full path of the data source. The connection will be created and opened for this data source. This parameter is returned by the [CtDatabase](../Proprietes/2512047.md) property.
![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) XML: This parameter corresponds to the name of XML file.![HFSQL Client/Server](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HFCS.png) This parameter corresponds to the server name. The port number used by the HFSQL server can be specified. The port 4900 will be used by default. If the port number of the HFSQL server is different, use the following notation: 
&lt;Computer name&gt;: &lt;Port number&gt; 
Example: "ComputerName:4901".
For a use via Internet, the ports must be managed by Firewall. For more details, see [Managing ports](../WDLang4/3044334.md).
You have the ability to specify an IPv6 address by writing the IPv6 address between square brackets. In this case, the port number must be specified after the closing square bracket. For example: [0154:2145:2155::5554]:4900.  
![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Access by JDBC: 

- This parameter corresponds to URL for connecting to the database.

- Depending on the JDBC driver used, the database name must be specified in the connection URL.




**`<Database>: (Character string)`**

Name of database that will be used on the data source, empty string ("") if no name must be specified. This parameter can be used if the data source allows you to specify the database that must be used. 
For example, on SQL Server, the "Master" database is the default database but other databases can be handled ("dbo" for example). 
To specify that the access is performed on a file found in the "dbo" database (that is not the default database), &lt;Database&gt; must correspond to "dbo".

This parameter is returned by the [CtInitialCatalog](../Proprietes/2512018.md) property.

**`<OLE DB provider or Native Connector>: (Character string or constant)`**



- Name of OLE DB provider used. To easily retrieve the string to use, select "Connection" in the data model editor (see the Notes).

### Syntax 1: Using a character string for the OLE DB provider
<a name="syntax_1_using_character_string_for_the_ole_provider_ELTPARAGRAPHE000585"></a>

To easily find the character string that must be used to define the OLE DB provider, we recommend that you proceed as follows:

1. In the data model editor, open the connection description window: on the "Analysis" tab, in the "Connections" group, click "Connections".

2. Select the provider to use ("Connect via" combo box).

3. The character string corresponding to the provider is displayed. This character string can be used to define the OLE DB provider used in &lt;OLE DB provider&gt;.

### Syntax 1: Pseudo-connection to HFSQL Classic database
<a name="syntax_1_pseudoconnection_hfsql_classic_database_ELTPARAGRAPHE000612"></a>

OLE DB data files or native data files are described in the data model editor. To handle these descriptions through programming with an HFSQL database, simply specify the *hAccessHF7* constant as provider name.

Then, this connection can be assigned to the data files affected by [HChangeConnection](../WDLang4/3044150.md).

The data files in HFSQL format corresponding to the description of the OLE DB or native files will be created (if necessary) in the directory defined by &lt;Data source&gt;. By default, these data files are empty when they are created.
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Differences between HOpenConnection and HDescribeConnection
<a name="differences_between_hopenconnection_and_hdescribeconnection_ELTPARAGRAPHE000626"></a>

**Method 1**: To open a connection at the start of the application and close it at the end, use [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md). To use this connection when handling data files or tables, simply change this connection with [HChangeConnection](../WDLang4/3044150.md).


```wl
HOpenConnection(MyConnection, params)       // open the connection
HChangeConnection(AFile, MyConnection)
```


**Method 2**: To describe a connection through programming and to automatically open it when opening the data file, you must:

- describe the connection with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md).

- associate this connection with the desired data file description using [HChangeConnection](../WDLang4/3044150.md). The connection will only be opened the first time the data file is accessed.




This solution can be useful when an application handles both HFSQL data files and Oracle data files. For example, if the application uses a single Oracle file, in a specific process, the connection to the Oracle database will only be made if necessary.

If the first solution is chosen for the same type of application, the connection (that may take quite a long time) will be established whenever the application is started.

Example:


```wl
HDescribeConnection(MyConnection, params)
HChangeConnection(AFile, MyConnection)
...
HReadFirst(AFile) // Open the connection
...
HClose(AFile) // Close the connection
```

### Using the Native xBase Connector with non-Latin character sets
<a name="using_the_native_xbase_connector_with_nonlatin_character_sets_ELTPARAGRAPHE000662"></a>

To use the Native xBase Connector with non-Latin character sets, a standard OEM/ANSI conversion must be performed by the Native Connector. To do so, the following string must be specified in the extended information:

OEMTOANSI=WINDOWS;

**Example**:

1. In the initialization code of the project, add the code used to modify the character set:
	
	```wl
	ChangeCharset(charsetChinese)
	```


2. Create an xBase connection:
	
	```wl
	HDescribeConnection("CntxBase", "", "", fExeDir(), "", hNativeAccessxBase, hOReadWrite, ...
		"OEMTOANSI=WINDOWS;")
	HChangeConnection("*", "CntxBase")
	```

### UDL file
<a name="udl_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000682"></a>

To create a UDL file:

1. Create a text file whose extension is "UDL".

2. Double-click this file. The window for the properties of the data links is opened.

3. Configure the connection.

4. Run the test of the connection.

5. Validate ("OK" button). The UDL file can now be used.
