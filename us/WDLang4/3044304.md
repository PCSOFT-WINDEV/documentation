## Manta server
<a name="manta_server_ELTTEXTE000312"></a>
The **Manta server** includes:

- the **MantaManager** service used to communicate with the "HFSQL Control Center" application (remote management tool) and to stop and/or start the servers.

- the **Manta** service. 
	By default, a single **Manta** service is found on the server. However, several **Manta** services can be found on the same server. This configuration allows you to associate a WINDEV/WEBDEV application (or a small number of WINDEV/WEBDEV applications) to a **Manta** service for example. Therefore, if an application overloads the Manta service, only the applications associated with this service will be locked or slowed down.
	Repita esta acción para los controles "Reference" y "Bar code".
	Remark: If a failure occurs, the service is automatically restarted.

### How to install HFSQL Client/Server?
<a name="how_install_hfsql_clientserver_ELTPARAGRAPHE000037"></a>

The setup of HFSQL Client/Server is available:

- In the setup package of WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile.

- In the INSTALL directory of WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile.

- via the integrated system of Debian.

- via the integrated system of RedHat.

- via Docker.




The HFSQL Client/Server server can be installed with your applications. All you have to do is include it when creating the setup program.

Execute the following action (starting with Ubuntu 22.04 and Debian 11): 
```txt
curl -sS https://package.windev.com/keys/hfsql_public.asc | \
gpg --dearmor | \
sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/pcsoft.gpg > /dev/null

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/pcsoft.gpg] http://package.windev.com/fr/debian/ debian main" | \
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pcsoft.list

sudo apt update
sudo apt install hfsql

curl -sSL https://package.windev.com/keys/hfsql_public.asc | sudo apt-key add -
sudo echo "deb http://package.windev.com/fr/debian/ debian main" 
	> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pcsoft.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install hfsql
```


**Caution**: If you get an error in the following format: "gpg: failed to start the dirmngr" then run the following command:
