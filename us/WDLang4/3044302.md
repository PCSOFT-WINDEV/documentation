### Paths
<a name="paths_ELTPARAGRAPHE000020"></a>

The paths specified in the following functions and properties must be relative to the database found on the server (database used in the connection). This operating mode allows you to be independent of the location of the server used.

For example, in the diagram below, the databases correspond to the following directories: "DataApplicationA", "DataApplicationB" and "DataApplicationC".

In this example, after the call to **HChangeDir**, the new access path to the data file named "Customer.fic" will be ".\\DataAplicationA\\Customer2004\\Customer.fic".


```wl
HChangeDir(CUSTOMER, "Customer2004")
```


or


```wl
HChangeDir(CUSTOMER, ".\Customer2004")
```





|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [DescribedDirectory](../Proprietes/2512074.md) | The directory of the data file must be relative to the database found on the server. |
| [Directory](../Proprietes/2512078.md) | The directory of the data file must be relative to the database found on the server. |
| [HChangeDir](../WDLang4/3044168.md) | The access path to the data file must be relative to the database found on the server. |
| [HDeclareExternal](../WDLang4/3044204.md) | The access path to the data file to import must be relative to the database found on the server. |

### WLanguage functions
<a name="wlanguage_functions_ELTPARAGRAPHE000061"></a>

The following functions have a different operating mode in an HFSQL Client/Server application:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [HCreateView](../WDLang4/3044159.md) | The *hViewBreakable* constant is not available in a WINDEV HFSQL Client/Server application.<br>The &lt;Page Size&gt; parameter is ignored. |
| [HDeclareExternal](../WDLang4/3044204.md) | The syntax 3 (use with OLE DB/Native Access) is not available in a WINDEV HFSQL Client/Server application. |
| [HListLink](../WDLang4/3044138.md) | The name of the files found in &lt;Result&gt; corresponds to the name and to the relative path of these files. |
| [HReadSeek](../WDLang4/3044050.md) | The *hLimitParsing* constant is not available in a WINDEV HFSQL Client/Server application. |

<a name="NOTE3_1"></a>


## Functions not available in an HFSQL Client/Server application
<a name="functions_not_available_hfsql_clientserver_application_ELTTEXTE000281"></a>
The following functions are not available in a HFSQL Client/Server application.


|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HChangeLocation | HDBCreation | HDBDescribeFile |
| HDBDescribeIndex | HDBDescribeField | HDBIndex |
| HDBOpen | HDBOpenNoLock | HDBSortType |
| HInitHF55 | HMigrateLinkedCompositeKey | HMode |
| HSecurity |   |   |

The functions followed by the "\*" character will be available in a forthcoming version.

### Notes
<a name="notes_ELTPARAGRAPHE000127"></a>

Like in a WINDEV HFSQL Network application, the data handled by the following functions are supplied by the clients. Consequently, these data files must be found on the client computer (or they must be accessible by the client computer).

Therefore, the path of the data files is defined in relation to the client computer.
