Used to restore: 

- an immediate backup (performed by [&lt;Connection variable&gt;.Backup](../WDLang4/1000022752.md) or via the HFSQL Control Center).

- a scheduled backup (described by [&lt;Connection variable&gt;.AddScheduledBackup](../WDLang4/1000022644.md) or via the HFSQL Control Center).


The restored backup can be a full backup or a differential backup.

**Caution: restoring a backup must be done with great care.**

To perform this operation, you must have the rights to perform a backup (*hRightsBackup*) as well as the rights to lock the database (*hRightsLock*).

**To restore the entire server** (or the __jnl and __trs databases), no other application must be connected to the server. The connection used must not be attached to a database (during the call to [&lt;Connection variable&gt;.OpenConnection](../WDLang4/1000023962.md), the &lt;Database&gt; parameter must correspond to an empty string ("")). 

**To restore the databases**, no connection must be established on the database to restore.

**Duplicating a database**: A special syntax of **&lt;Connection variable&gt;.RestoreBackup** (syntax 2) is used to restore the backup of a database under a different name. This allows you to perform a copy of a database by renaming it. For example: to perform a copy of the MyDatabase2008 database by renaming it into MyDatabase2009, all you have to do is perform a backup of MyDatabase2008 and restore it under the MyDatabase2009 name.

## Example


```wl
ctServer is Connection

// Restore a backup
IF ctServer.RestoreBackup(BackupID) = False THEN
	Error("Failure restoring the backup" + HErrorInfo(hErrMessage))
END
```
<a name="Example2"></a>

```wl
ctServer is Connection

// Restore a full and differential backup
BackupInfo = ctServer.InfoBackup(BackupID)
BackupPath_Diff = ExtractString(BackupInfo, 4, TAB)

BackupInfo = ctServer.InfoBackup(nBackupID_Full)
BackupPath_Comp = ExtractString(BackupInfo, 4, TAB)

IF ctServer.RestoreBackup(BackupPath_Comp, BackupPath_Diff) = False THEN
	Error("Failure restoring the backup" + HErrorInfo(hErrMessage))
END

## Syntax

### Restoring a backup from its identifier or from its path

`<Result> = <Connection>.RestoreBackup(<Backup> [, <Progress Bar>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the backup was restored,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) is used to identify the error.




**`<Connection>: (Connection variable)`**

Name of the [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md) variable that describes the connection to the server on which the backup will be restored.

**`<Backup>: (Integer or character string)`**

Can correspond to:

- **Backup identifier**. This identifier can correspond to the identifier of full backup or to the identifier of differential backup. 
	During an immediate backup, this identifier is returned by [&lt;Connection variable&gt;.Backup](../WDLang4/1000022752.md). This identifier can also be returned by [&lt;Connection variable&gt;.InfoBackup](../WDLang4/1000022679.md).
	In a scheduled backup, this identifier corresponds to the **Identifier** property of the [hBackupDescription](../WDLang4/1000017455.md) variable. 

- **Path and name of backup to restore**. This name was specified during the backup. This name can also be returned by [&lt;Connection variable&gt;.InfoBackup](../WDLang4/1000022679.md). If this name corresponds to a relative path, the backup will be sought in the "Backup" subdirectory of HFSQL server. To specify the directory of Manta service, simply use "%%EXE%%".




**`<Progress Bar>: (Optional window name, optional control name or optional integer)`**



- Name of the window where the progress bar will be displayed or name of the Progress Bar control.

- Handle of the window that displays the progress bar.

### Restoring a backup under a different database name

`<Result> = <Connection>.RestoreBackup(<Backup> , <Source database> , <Destination database> [, <Progress Bar>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the backup was restored,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) is used to identify the error.




**`<Connection>: (Connection variable)`**

Name of the [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md) variable that describes the connection to the server on which the backup will be restored.

**`<Backup>: (Integer or character string)`**

Can correspond to:

- Backup identifier, returned by [&lt;Connection variable&gt;.Backup](../WDLang4/1000022752.md). This identifier can also be returned by [&lt;Connection variable&gt;.InfoBackup](../WDLang4/1000022679.md).  

- Path and name of backup to restore. This name was specified during the backup. This name can also be returned by [&lt;Connection variable&gt;.InfoBackup](../WDLang4/1000022679.md). If this name corresponds to a relative path, the backup will be sought in the "Backup" subdirectory of HFSQL server. To specify the directory of Manta service, simply use "%%EXE%%".




**`<Source database>: (Character string)`**

Name of database to restore found in the backup. This syntax allows you to restore a single database found in the backup.

**`<Destination database>: (Character string)`**

Name of database that will be restored. This name may be different from the source database. In this case, the function allows you to make a copy of the database and rename it.

**`<Progress Bar>: (Optional window name, optional control name or optional integer)`**



- Name of the window where the progress bar will be displayed or name of the Progress Bar control.

- Handle of the window that displays the progress bar.

### Restoring a differential backup found in a specific directory (available from version 15)

`<Result> = <Connection>.RestoreBackup(<Full backup> , <Differential backup> [, <Progress Bar>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the backup was restored,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) is used to identify the error.




**`<Connection>: (Connection variable)`**

Name of the [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md) variable that describes the connection to the server on which the backup will be restored.

**`<Full backup>: (Character string)`**

Path and name of the full backup to restore. This name was specified during the backup. This name can also be returned by [&lt;Connection variable&gt;.InfoBackup](../WDLang4/1000022679.md). If this name corresponds to a relative path, the backup will be sought in the "Backup" subdirectory of HFSQL server. To specify the directory of Manta service, simply use "%%EXE%%".

**`<Differential backup>: (Character string)`**

Path and name of the differential backup that must be applied to the full backup. This name was specified during the backup. This name can also be returned by [&lt;Connection variable&gt;.InfoBackup](../WDLang4/1000022679.md). If this name corresponds to a relative path, the backup will be sought in the "Backup" subdirectory of HFSQL server. To specify the directory of Manta service, simply use "%%EXE%%".

**`<Progress Bar>: (Optional window name, optional control name or optional integer)`**



- Name of the window where the progress bar will be displayed or name of the Progress Bar control.

- Handle of the window that displays the progress bar.

## Remarks


### Rights required to restore a backup
<a name="rights_required_restore_backup_ELTPARAGRAPHE000473"></a>

To restore a backup, the user or the group must have:

- the rights to perform backups (*hRightsBackup* constant). These rights apply to the servers and to the databases.

- the rights to lock the database (*hRightsLock* constant). These rights apply to the databases.




To find out whether these rights are granted to a user or to a group, use [&lt;Connection variable&gt;.InfoServerRights](../WDLang4/1000022668.md) or [&lt;Connection variable&gt;.InfoDatabaseRights](../WDLang4/1000022666.md).

To modify the rights granted to a user or to a group of users, use [&lt;Connection variable&gt;.ModifyServerRights](../WDLang4/1000022710.md) or [&lt;Connection variable&gt;.ModifyDatabaseRights](../WDLang4/1000022707.md).

### Restore operation performed from the HFSQL Control Center
<a name="restore_operation_performed_from_the_hfsql_control_center_ELTPARAGRAPHE000510"></a>

A backup can be restored from the HFSQL Control Center. This backup is available in the "Backups" tab of the server description.
