## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000125"></a>
A HFSQL application can operate in network mode or in Client/Server mode.

To find out which operating mode is adapted to your applications, let's compare these two modes.


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| **In HFSQL Network mode** | **In HFSQL Client/Server mode** |
| A HFSQL Network application is run on different user computers. | A HFSQL Client/Server application is run on different user computers (called client computers). |
| The data files are found in a directory accessible to the user computers. Each client computer physically accesses the data files. | Data files are located on a server. Only the server physically accesses the data files. |
| The processes (queries, read/add operation in a data file, ...) are performed on each user computer. | All the processes (queries, read/add operations in a data file, ...) are performed on the server |

## Usage example

### Reading a record
<a name="reading_record_ELTPARAGRAPHE000050"></a>


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| <br><br>- 1 network access to read the indexes (".NDX" file).<br><br>- 1 network access to read the record (".FIC" file).<br><br><br> | <br><br>- 1 network access to request the record toward the server.<br><br><br><br><br>Remark: Each client computer maintains a cache containing blocks of records. Therefore, no new network access is required to read the next records. |
| In HFSQL Network mode | In HFSQL Client/Server mode |

**Running a simple selection query**:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| <br><br>- In a simplified manner, as many network accesses as the number of retrieved records (for the index file **and** the data file).<br><br><br><br><br>For example, 500 network accesses if the query result contains 1000 records. | <br><br>- 1 network access to send the query.<br><br>- 1 network access to retrieve the result of the query.<br><br><br><br><br>For example, 500 network accesses if the query result contains 2 records. |
