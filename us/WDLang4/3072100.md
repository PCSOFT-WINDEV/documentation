## Overview

WINDEV and WEBDEV include an optional module to access AS/400 databases. This Native Connector allows access to AS/400 databases from a program written in WLanguage without external drivers.

This allows you to propose interfaces (Windows and WEB 2.0) that will handle the AS/400 data in native mode in read-only and in read/write.

The configuration of the computers is straightforward. WINDEV and WEBDEV communicate with your AS/400 either via the APPC protocol of your router, or via the TCP/IP protocol.

**Remark**: The "Native AS/400 Connector" module was developed by "Aura Equipements". The Native AS/400 Connector includes a help file with all its specific features.
