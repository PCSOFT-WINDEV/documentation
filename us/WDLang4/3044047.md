Reads a record in a data file according to a given record number. This read mode is called "Direct access". The record read is loaded in memory. [HState](../WDLang4/3044081.md) is used to find out the record status (active, crossed or deleted).

In most cases, **HRead** is used to position in the data file in order to perform a read loop by specifying the record number.

Several cases may occur after the call to **HRead**:

- the specified record number does not exist (greater than the total number of records or negative): no reading is performed and [HOut](../WDLang4/3044094.md) returns <u><u><u>True</u></u></u>.

- the specified record number does not exist anymore (crossed record, deleted record, ...): no read operation is performed and [HOut](../WDLang4/3044094.md) returns <u><u><u>False</u></u></u>.
	Use [HState](../WDLang4/3044081.md) to find out the record status.

- the data file is empty: [HOut](../WDLang4/3044094.md) returns <u><u><u>True</u></u></u>.

- the function tries to lock a record that is already locked in read-only: [HErrorLock](../WDLang4/3044099.md) returns <u><u><u>True</u></u></u> and [HOut](../WDLang4/3044094.md) returns <u><u><u>True</u></u></u>.
	![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Access by JDBC: The management of locks is not available for databases accessed by JDBC.




This function can be used with the data files (indexed or not) and with the HFSQL views.

## Example


```wl
// Sequential iteration to display the name of all customers
i is int
FOR i = 1 _TO_ hNbRec(Customer, hStateAll)
	HRead(Customer, i)
	IF HState() = hStateActive THEN 
		Info("Customer name: " + Customer.Name)
	END
END
```

## Syntax

`<Result> = HRead([<Data file> [, <Record number> [, <Options>]]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the record was read,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if an error occurred (lock, end of data file, etc.): the record is not read. [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) is used to identify the error.




**`<Data file>: (Optional character string)`**

Name of the HFSQL data file, view or query used.

If this parameter is an empty string (""), **HRead** manipulates the last data file used by the last HFSQL function (function starting with "H").

**`<Record number>: (Optional integer)`**

Number of the record to read.

If this parameter is not specified (or is equal to 0 or to the *hCurrentRecNum* constant), **HRead** will read the current record.
![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) **HRead** reads the current record only. You cannot specify a record number other than the current one. To specify the current record number, use the *hCurrentRecNum* constant.![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Access by JDBC: **HRead** reads the current record only. You cannot specify a record number other than the current one. To specify the current record, use the *hCurrentRecNum* constant. 

**`<Options>: (Optional constant)`**

Configures the lock set on the record read by **HRead**:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hLockNo* | No lock: the record can be read or modified by another application during the reading. |
| *hLockReadWrite* | Lock in read/write: the record currently read cannot be read or modified by another application. |
| *hLockWrite* | Lock in write mode: the record currently read can be read by another application but it cannot be modified by another application. |

![Hyper File 5.5](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HF55.png) The lock options are ignored. Use locking functions ([HLockRecNum](../WDLang4/3044152.md)) kept for backward compatibility.![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) The lock options will have no effect if the locks are not supported by the OLE DB provider or by the Native Connector.![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Access by JDBC: This parameter is ignored.

### Records read
<a name="records_read_ELTPARAGRAPHE000210"></a>

**HRead** is the only function that can be used to access a crossed or deleted record. If the record is deleted, the content of the record is not valid anymore.
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Looping through a data file
<a name="looping_through_data_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000221"></a>

**HRead** cannot be used to continue an iteration started by [HReadFirst](../WDLang4/3044051.md), [HReadNext](../WDLang4/3044037.md).
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Memos
<a name="memos_ELTPARAGRAPHE000238"></a>

The memos associated with the record can be automatically read (or not) when reading the record. [HSetMemo](../WDLang4/3044139.md) is used to customize this automatic read operation.

If the memos are supported, the associated text memos are read when the record is read. The binary memos are read only when they are explicitly used ([HExtractMemo](../WDLang4/3044072.md)).

### Locks
<a name="locks_ELTPARAGRAPHE000257"></a>

By default (&lt;Options&gt; not specified), the record is not locked.

If a lock is requested (*hLockWrite* or *hLockReadWrite* constant), the record will be read only if this record is not already locked.

![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) The lock options will have no effect if the locks are not supported by the OLE DB provider or by the Native Connector.

### Miscellaneous
<a name="miscellaneous_ELTPARAGRAPHE000272"></a>

- The result of [HFound](../WDLang4/3044104.md) must be ignored ([HFound](../WDLang4/3044104.md) must be used for the searches performed by [HReadSeekFirst](../WDLang4/3044036.md) and [HReadSeekLast](../WDLang4/3044034.md)).

- The current record number is returned by [HRecNum](../WDLang4/3044063.md). The first record found in the data file is record #1.

- This function replaces **HReadLock** and **HReadNoLock**, which were kept for compatibility with WINDEV 5.5.
