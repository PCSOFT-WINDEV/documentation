The **Alias** type is used to declare and handle a logical alias for a data file or query. 

**Reminder**: An alias allows you to: 

- work on different physical data files with the same logical description. 

- have multiple "pointers" to the same file to do nested iterations. 


For example, for a data file: 

- the data file is described in the analysis. 

- the data file alias is created using a variable of type **Alias**.




**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

## Example


```wl
// Create an alias for the "Order" data file
OrderCheck is Alias of Order
// "OrderCheck" can now be used in processes.
// It behaves like the "Order" data file described in the analysis.
// -------------------
// By default, the name of the physical file associated to the alias corresponds to the
// name of the physical file associated with the source file 
// ---------------------------
// To use a file on another database or in another directory,
// you must use HChangeConnection or HChangeDir
```

## Remarks


### Deleting the alias
<a name="deleting_the_alias_ELTPARAGRAPHE000038"></a>

The alias is automatically destroyed at the end of the process where it was declared.

### Physical data file associated with an alias
<a name="physical_data_file_associated_with_alias_ELTPARAGRAPHE000045"></a>

By default, the alias and source file have: 

- the same physical file name.

- the same connection.

- the same password. 

- the same physical location.  


To associate the alias with a physical data file that has a different name, use [HChangeName](../WDLang4/3044141.md). If necessary: 

- [HChangeConnection](../WDLang4/3044150.md) redefines the connection related to the data file. 

- [HChangeDir](../WDLang4/3044168.md) redefines the data file directory.

### Advantages compared to the [HAlias](../WDLang4/3044176.md) function
<a name="advantages_compared_the_haliaswdlang43044176md_function_ELTPARAGRAPHE000070"></a>

Any directory, connection or password changes made before the alias is created are automatically taken into account when the alias is defined. 
For example: 

- Code used with [HAlias](../WDLang4/3044176.md): 
	
	```wl
	HChangeDir(My_File, "New path")
	HChangeConnection(My_File, MyConnection)
	HPass(My_File, "pswrd")
	
	HAlias(MyAlias, My_File)
	HChangeName(MyAlias, My_File.PhysicalName)
	HChangeDir(MyAlias, "New path")
	HChangeConnection(MyAlias, MyConnection)
	HPass(MyAlias, "pswrd")
	```


- Code used with a variable of type **Alias**: 
	
	```wl
	HChangeDir(My_File, "New path")
	HChangeConnection(My_File, MyConnection)
	HPass(My_File, "pswrd")
	MyAlias is Alias of My_File
	```










### Alias and queries
<a name="alias_and_queries_ELTPARAGRAPHE000090"></a>

To create an alias for a query created in the query editor, simply:

- run the initial query. 

- declare a variable of type **Alias** and specify the query name and the alias name. 

- use [HExecuteQuery](../WDLang4/3044080.md) with the alias query. The alias is initialized.




**Remark**: When creating the alias, the initial query must have been run.

Example:


```wl
IF HExecuteQuery(QRY_Query1) = False THEN
	Error(HError(hErrCurrent)) 
ELSE
	HReadFirst(QRY_Query1)
	Trace(QRY_Query1.City)
	QueryAlias is Alias of QRY_Query1
	IF HExecuteQuery(QueryAlias) = False THEN
		Error(HError(hErrCurrent)) 
	ELSE
		FOR EACH AliasQuery
			Trace(QueryAlias.City)
		END
	END
END
```

### Handling the alias file and its items
<a name="handling_the_alias_file_and_its_items_ELTPARAGRAPHE000110"></a>

- In the window or page editor, controls cannot be directly bound to the items of the alias files. You must:

	- assign a value to each control in the code.

	- use the [ControlAlias](../WDLang1/3025016.md) function or the [DataBinding](../Proprietes/2510060.md) property before calling: 

		- the [FileToScreen](../WDLang4/3044210.md) function.

		- the [FileToPage](../WDLang4/3044148.md) function.




- The alias files can be handled by [HListItem](../WDLang4/3044230.md) and [HListKey](../WDLang4/3044060.md). The alias files can be re-indexed.

- By default, the **password of an alias file** is identical to the password of the initial data file. This password can be changed using [HPass](../WDLang4/3044108.md). The name of the data file used in this function corresponds to the name of the alias.

- The automatic modification of the data files can be applied to the alias files.

- The locks performed on the data files or on the records are effective between the aliases of the same instance of an application.
