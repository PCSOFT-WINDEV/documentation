| **rplDateSynchroFromMaster** | Sought information: Date of the last synchronization from the master database. | [HInfoReplica](../WDLang4/3044015.md) |
| **rplDateSynchroFromSubscriber** | Sought information: Date of last synchronization | [HInfoReplica](../WDLang4/3044015.md) |
| **rplDateSynchroToMaster** | Sought information: Date of the last synchronization toward the master database. | [HInfoReplica](../WDLang4/3044015.md) |
| **rplDateSynchroToSubscriber** | Sought information: Date of the last synchronization toward the subscriber database. | [HInfoReplica](../WDLang4/3044015.md) |
| **rplDeleteConflict** | The record was deleted from the destination replica and it was modified or deleted in the source replica. | [HSynchronizeReplica](../WDLang4/3044014.md) |
| **rplHAdd** | Replicate an addition | [HSynchronizeReplica](../WDLang4/3044014.md) |
| **rplHDelete** | Replicate a deletion | [HSynchronizeReplica](../WDLang4/3044014.md) |
| **rplHModify** | Replicate a modification | [HSynchronizeReplica](../WDLang4/3044014.md) |
| **rplMasterFirst** | The data found in the master database has priority during the replication. | [HSynchronizeReplica](../WDLang4/3044014.md) |
| **rplMasterIsUpToDate** | Sought information: The master replica is updated or not. | [HInfoReplica](../WDLang4/3044015.md) |

| **rplReplicationDisabled** | Used to temporarily disable the management of replication. | [HSetReplication](../WDLang4/3044067.md) |
| **rplReplicationHeterogeneous** | Constant kept for backward compatibility. This constant is identical to *rplReplicationUniversal*. | [HSetReplication](../WDLang4/3044067.md) |
| **rplReplicationLogged** | Allows you to perform a replication between HFSQL files (uses the logged HFSQL files). | [HSetReplication](../WDLang4/3044067.md) |
| **rplReplicationUniversal** | Used to perform a universal replication (between a HFSQL database and an Oracle database for example). | [HSetReplication](../WDLang4/3044067.md) |
| **rplSubscriberFirst** | The data found in the subscriber database (or in the subscriber file) has priority during the replication. | [HSynchronizeReplica](../WDLang4/3044014.md),<br>[HRplManageFile](../WDLang4/1000017215.md) |
| **rplSubscriberIsUpToDate** | Sought information: The subscriber replica is updated or not | [HInfoReplica](../WDLang4/3044015.md) |
| **rplToMaster** | <br><br>- Update the master database according to the subscriber database.<br><br>- Update the master file according to the subscriber database.<br><br><br> | [HSynchronizeReplica](../WDLang4/3044014.md),<br>[HRplManageFile](../WDLang4/1000017215.md) |
