Restores the previously saved context of a data file ([HSavePosition](../WDLang4/3044136.md)): current record, filter, pointers.

**HRestorePosition** is used to restore:

- the number of the record used,

- the different pointers in the index (the position in the index is saved for each key), 

- the current filter (only if the *hRPFilter* constant is specified).




This function can be used with the data files, HFSQL views or queries.

## Example


```wl
// Find a record
HReadSeekFirst(Customer, Name, Name)
WHILE HFound(Customer) = True
	// Saves the current context
	nPos = HSavePosition(Customer, Name)
	// Check a customer with another name
	HReadSeek(Customer, Name, Name2)
	IF HFound() = True THEN Counter = Counter + 1
	// Restores the context
	HRestorePosition(nPos)
	HReadNext(Customer, Name)
END
```

## Syntax

### Restoring the specified position

`<Result> = HRestorePosition(<Position> [, <Option>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the specified position was restored,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) returns more details about the problem.




**`<Position>: (Integer)`**

Position to restore. Value returned by [HSavePosition](../WDLang4/3044136.md).

**`<Option>: (Optional constant (or combination of constants))`**

Used to configure the restore operation:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hRPDefault*<br>(default value) | The position is freed. The stored position is restored. |
| *hRPFilter* | Restores the filter implemented during the call to [HSavePosition](../WDLang4/3044136.md). |
| *hRPHF5* | If the stored position was deleted or modified, this position is still restored.<br>If the *hRPHF5* constant is not specified and if the backup was performed on several items, the positioning is performed according to the current record number during the call to [HSavePosition](../WDLang4/3044136.md).<br><br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Access by JDBC: This constant is not supported. |
| *hRPKeep* | The position is not freed (other calls to **HRestorePosition** can be performed on this position). |

![Hyper File 5.5](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HF55.png) This parameter is ignored: the position will be saved for all items being looped through.

### Restoring a data file

`<Result> = HRestorePosition([<Data file>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the context has been restored, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) returns more details about the problem.




**`<Data file>: (Optional character string)`**

Name of the data file whose context is to be restored. If this name is not specified, **HRestorePosition** will use the last data file used by the last HFSQL function (function starting with "H").

## Remarks


### Reinitializing positions
<a name="reinitializing_positions_ELTPARAGRAPHE000192"></a>

Caution: all the functions that open or close a data file reinitialize the context numbers ([HCreation](../WDLang4/3044255.md), [HClose](../WDLang4/3044073.md), etc.).

If the record saved by [HSavePosition](../WDLang4/3044136.md) was deleted, **HRestorePosition** keeps the current context but it will position on the record following the deleted record.
![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png) When reinitializing a browse, the positions saved on this browse are destroyed. The HFSQL engine is using the value of best item to attempt a new positioning. The best item is selected in the following preference order:

1. Automatic identifier

2. Unique key

3. First key

4. First item


The following functions reinitialize the iteration:

- [HReadFirst](../WDLang4/3044051.md)/[HFirst](../WDLang4/3044113.md)

- [HReadLast](../WDLang4/3044140.md)/[HLast](../WDLang4/3044101.md)

- [HSetMemo](../WDLang4/3044139.md)



<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Miscellaneous
<a name="miscellaneous_ELTPARAGRAPHE000237"></a>

- The number of calls to [HSavePosition](../WDLang4/3044136.md) is not limited.

- You can nest [HSavePosition](../WDLang4/3044136.md) and **HRestorePosition** for the same data file.

### Repositioning principle for Native Connectors (also called Native Access)
<a name="repositioning_principle_for_native_connectors_also_called_native_access_ELTPARAGRAPHE000257"></a>

The record is restored from the internal cache of the Native Connector.

Caution: during the restore operation, no check is performed regarding the existence of record in the database (the record may have been deleted).

You have the ability to "force" the reading on the database by using [HRead](../WDLang4/3044047.md) after **HRestorePosition**. In this case:

- the record values will be read again in the database.

- if the record has been deleted, the Native Connector will return error 13: The current record cannot be found. It was modified or deleted from the data source.




**Special cases: Native MySQL, DB2 and Informix Connectors**: After the call to **HRestorePosition**, [HReadNext](../WDLang4/3044037.md) and [HReadPrevious](../WDLang4/3044048.md) generate a query to find the record following or preceding the restored record.
