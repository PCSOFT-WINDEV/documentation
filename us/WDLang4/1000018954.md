<a name="description"></a>
Simulates how the HFSQL Client/Server works: 

- on an ADSL, 3G, 4G and 5G network or via the cloud. 

- on a slow network with custom settings.




**Remark**: This function can be used to test an application (locally or over a LAN) that uses HFSQL in an ADSL, 3G, 4G or 5G network, in the cloud or with custom settings. This function slows down all the communications between the client and the HFSQL server.

**This function is used when debugging and optimizing an application.**

## Example


```wl
// Simulate the 3G network
HSimulateNetwork(h3G)
ProfilerStart()
Proc_Process() // Process whose performance in 3G must be analyzed
ProfilerEnd()
// Back to a standard operating mode
HSimulateNetwork(hNone)
```

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

### Simulating how HFSQL Client/Server works on a previously configured network

`<Result> = HSimulateNetwork([<Connection>, ] <Type of network>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the simulation is started, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if an error occurs.




**`<Connection>: (Character string or Connection variable)`**

Connection to use. This connection corresponds to:

- the name of the connection defined in the data model editor or with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

- the name of a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md).


If this parameter is not specified, the simulation is applied to all the current and future connections.

**`<Type of network>: (Integer constant)`**

Type of network to simulate: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *h3G* | Type of network to simulate: 3G<br>Characteristics (estimate): Latency: 130ms, Bandwidth: 1 Mbps |
| *h4G* | Type of network to simulate: 4G<br>Characteristics (estimate): Latency: 40ms, Bandwidth: 30 Mbps |
| *h5G* | Type of network to simulate: 5G<br>Characteristics (estimate): Latency: 10ms, Bandwidth: 100 Mbps |
| *hADSL* | Type of network to simulate: ADSL<br>Characteristics (estimate): Latency: 40ms, Bandwidth: 8 Mbps |
| *hCloud* | Type of network to simulate: Cloud.<br>Characteristics (estimate): Latency: 10ms, Bandwidth: 400 Mbps<br>These values apply when the application is used from the same continent as the data center, with a fiber Internet connection. If the application is used from another continent, or with a Wi-Fi connection, it is recommended to use the second syntax of the function by specifying the latency and the speed of the connection. |
| *hNone* | Used to disable the simulation of a specific network. |

### Simulating how HFSQL Client/Server works on a custom network

`<Result> = HSimulateNetwork([<Connection>, ] <Latency> , <Bandwidth>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the simulation is started, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if an error occurred.




**`<Connection>: (Character string or Connection variable)`**

Connection to use. This connection corresponds to:

- the name of the connection defined in the data model editor or with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

- the name of a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md).


If this parameter is not specified, the simulation is applied to all the current and future connections.

**`<Latency>: (Integer)`**

Simulated latency expressed in milliseconds. This latency is added to the latency of the current network. 

**`<Bandwidth>: (Real)`**

Bandwidth expressed in megabits per second. It represent the time needed to transfer a given amount of data (assuming that the current network has an infinite bandwidth).

## Remarks


- This function must not be used in a deployed application. This function is used when debugging and optimizing an application.

- This function increases the latency and reduces the throughput of the network connections used for HFSQL Client/Server.
