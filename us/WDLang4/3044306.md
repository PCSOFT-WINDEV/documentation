## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000202"></a>
You have the ability to create applications that access the HFSQL Client/Server databases.

An HFSQL Client/Server application runs an application on several computers (called client computers) and stores the databases and processes on a server. This operating mode makes response times faster and more reliable, and it simplifies the maintenance of the database.



**Example with WINDEV applications**: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P3-HFSQL-Client-Serveur.gif)


**Example with WEBDEV sites**: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P5-HFSQL-Client-Serveur.gif)


You can:

- create an HFSQL Client/Server application from scratch.

- modify an existing WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile application into an HFSQL Client/Server application.




**Remark**: To compare the HFSQL Client/Server mode with the HFSQL Network mode, see [Operating mode of HFSQL application](../WDLang4/3044303.md).

## Implementing an HFSQL Client/Server application
<a name="implementing_hfsql_clientserver_application_ELTTEXTE000232"></a>


### Steps to follow
<a name="steps_follow_ELTPARAGRAPHE000038"></a>

The steps for implementing an HFSQL Client/Server application are as follows: 

1. [Installing an HFSQL server and configuring the server used](../WDLang4/3044304.md).

2. [Connecting the client computers to the server](../WDLang4/3044301.md).

3. [Configuring the data files on the server](../WDLang4/3044305.md).

4. Using the application.



<a name="NOTE2_2"></a>


### Compatibility between versions
<a name="compatibility_between_versions_ELTPARAGRAPHE000056"></a>

The different versions of clients and servers are compatible. All the client versions can use all the versions of the server.

However, we advise you to always keep the HFSQL Client/Server engine in its most recent version proposed in [the download center](https://www.windev.com/ts/download/index.html), even if all the connected clients (applications and/or sites) are not compiled with the last version.

**Remark**: If the client DLL used is more recent than the server (client DLL in version 18 and server in version 12 for example), the new features will trigger an error such as "The server does not support this feature (server too old)" if they are used by the client application.

### Installing the HFSQL Client/Server server on a LINUX server
<a name="installing_the_hfsql_clientserver_server_linux_server_ELTPARAGRAPHE000070"></a>

To install the HFSQL Client/Server server on a LINUX server: 

1. Copy the following files to the server: 

	- manta_install 

	- mantainstall.zip 

	- README
			|These files are located in the "HFSQL Server\\Linux4" subdirectory of the setup package. 




2. Connect to the server as "root".

3. Run the manta_install file. You can: 

	- Install a new server.

	- Update an existing server. 

	- Uninstall a server.




4. Follow the instructions displayed on the screen. 


**Caution**: The license must be entirely scrolled in order to display the following screens. 



To install the 64-bit HFSQL Client/Server server on a 64-bit LINUX server: 

1. Copy the following files to the server: 

	- manta_install64

	- mantainstall.zip 

	- README
			These files are located in the "HFSQL Server\\Linux44_64" subdirectory of the setup package. 




2. Connect to the server as "root"

3. Run manta_install64. You can: 

	- Install a new server.

	- Update an existing server. 

	- Uninstall a server.




4. Follow the instructions displayed on the screen. 




**Caution**: The license must be entirely scrolled in order to display the following screens. 

**Remarks**: 

- The server will be installed as "Daemon (service)". 

- The following Linux versions are supported by the HFSQL engine for Linux: 

	- Linux4 version: Debian 7 (and later), OpenSuse 10.3 (and later)

	- Linux4 version (64-bit): Ubuntu 14 (and later)

### 32-bit and 64-bit HFSQL Client/Server server
<a name="32bit_and_64bit_hfsql_clientserver_server_ELTPARAGRAPHE000122"></a>

Two versions are available for the HFSQL server: 32-bit mode and 64-bit mode. The HFSQL client is also available in 32-bit mode and in 64-bit mode.

The server in 64-bit mode recognizes the clients in 32-bit mode and the server in 32-bit mode recognizes the clients in 64-bit mode.




### HFSQL Client/Server server and IPv6
<a name="hfsql_clientserver_server_and_ipv6_ELTPARAGRAPHE000132"></a>

The HFSQL server supports the IPV6 protocol. If the compute contains a network card configured in IPv6, the HFSQL server will automatically accept  the connections by using this protocol on all the network cards configured in IPv6.

The HFSQL server simultaneously supports the connections in IPv6 and in IPv4.

No code modification is required to use the IPv6 protocol. If the name of the server is resolved by the DNS into an IPv6 address, this protocol will be used.

## Limitations
<a name="limitations_ELTTEXTE000280"></a>


- The management mode of data files may have to be adapted when using an HFSQL Client/Server application. To learn more about the specific features to be taken into account, see [Differences and limitations specific to an HFSQL Client/Server application](../WDLang4/3044302.md).

- The HFSQL server is available for the following operating systems:

	- 32-bit Windows

	- 64-bit Windows

	- 32-bit Linux

	- 64-bit Linux


 It is not available for the other operating systems.
