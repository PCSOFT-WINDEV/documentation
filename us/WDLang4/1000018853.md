The **hScheduling** type is used to define and find out the characteristics of the scheduling that must be performed: 

- for a scheduled optimization task of HFSQL Client/Server files. 

- for a scheduled backup task of HFSQL Client/Server files.

- for a scheduled replication of HFSQL servers.


The characteristics of this scheduling can be defined and changed using different WLanguage properties. 

This type of variable is used: 

- by the [hScheduledOptimization](../WDLang4/1000018854.md) type. 

- by the [hBackupDescription](../WDLang4/1000017455.md) type. 

- by the [hRSConfig](../WDLang4/1000020484.md) type.




**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

## Example


```wl
// Recalculate statistics of files in "MyDatabase", 
// every Saturday at 23:00
Optim is hScheduledOptimization
Optim.Description = "Recalculating the statistics for the files" + ...  
	"found in the MyDatabase database"

// Define the scheduling
MyScheduling is hScheduling
MyScheduling.Month = "*"
MyScheduling.DayOfWeek = "Saturday"
MyScheduling.Hour = "23"
MyScheduling.Minute = "0"

Optim.Scheduling = MyScheduling

// Define the files to process
Optim.File[1].Name = "MyDatabase"
Optim.File[1].Option = hOptStat

// Add the scheduled optimization
HAddScheduledOptimization(MyConnection, Optim)
```

### Properties specific to the description of hScheduling variables

The following properties can be used to handle a scheduling:

| **Property name** | **Type used** | **Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DayOfMonth | Character string | Number of the day for which the scheduled task must be run ("31" for example). This number is included between 0 and 31.<br><br>This property can also correspond to:<br><br>- a list of numbers separated by commas: used to specify several months.<br><br>- an interval. For example, "9-13" (the task is scheduled from the 9th to the 13th of the month).<br><br>- a star ("\*") to specify the entire range.<br><br>- an interval with a step, "\*/2" for example to perform the task on every odd day of the month.<br><br><br> |
| DayOfMonthOrDayOfWeek | Boolean | Used to manage the execution of a scheduled task on the HFSQL Client/Server server by specifying the number of the day of the week or the number of the day of the month. Example: execution every Monday 1st day of month.<br>This property can correspond to: <br><br>- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> to run the scheduled task every Monday AND the first day of the month (cumulated conditions).<br><br>- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> to run the task on Monday 1st (exclusive conditions).<br><br><br> |
| DayOfWeek | Character string | Number of the day for which the scheduled task must be run ("2" for example). This number is included between 1 and 7 (1 = Monday, 2 = Tuesday, ...). <br>This property can also correspond to:<br><br>- a list of numbers separated by commas: used to specify several days.<br><br>- an interval. For example, "1-3" (the task is scheduled for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday).<br><br>- a star ("\*") to specify the entire range.<br><br>- an interval with a step, "\*/2" for example to perform the task on every even day of the week.<br><br>- the day of the week in letters ("monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday").<br><br><br> |
| Hour | Character string | Execution time of scheduled task. If **TimeUTC** is set to <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>, this time will be in UTC.<br><br>The possible values are:<br><br>- a digit included between 0 and 23.<br><br>- a list of numbers separated by commas: used to specify several hours.<br><br>- an interval. For example, "9-13".<br><br>- a star ("\*") to specify the entire range.<br><br>- an interval with a step, "\*/2" for example to perform the task at every even hour.<br><br><br> |
| Minute | Character string | Minutes of the execution time of the scheduled task. If **TimeUTC** is set to <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>, this time will be in UTC.<br><br>The possible values are:<br><br>- a digit included between 0 and 59.<br><br>- a list of numbers separated by commas: used to specify several minutes.<br><br>- an interval. For example, "9-13".<br><br>- a star ("\*") to specify the entire range.<br><br>- an interval with a step, "\*/2" for example to perform the task at every even minute.<br><br><br> |
| Month | Character string | Number of the execution month of scheduled task. The possible values are:<br><br>- a digit included between 1 and 12<br><br>- a list of numbers separated by commas: used to specify several months.<br><br>- an interval. For example, "9-11".<br><br>- a star ("\*") to specify the entire range.<br><br>- an interval with a step, "\*/2" for example to perform the task on every odd month.<br><br><br> |
| TimeUTC | Boolean | <br><br>- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> (default value) if the time is in UTC (**Hour** and **Minute** properties),<br><br>- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise.<br><br><br> |
