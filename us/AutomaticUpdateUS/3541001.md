## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000173"></a>
Do you have an active Internet connection on your development computer? You can automatically download the different editor updates (WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile) thanks to "Automatic update". 

This mechanism studies your computer to find the PC SOFT products to upgrade and provides a list of available upgrades according to your configuration. This allows you to always use the most recent version of the PC SOFT products.

**No personal information is sent to the server.**

This mechanism is optional, it can be disabled at any time. You still have the ability to visit the PC SOFT Web site and to manually download the upgrades available for your PC SOFT products.
