## Characteristics of a group
<a name="characteristics_group_ELTTEXTE000101"></a>
When you add a new group, a window opens and allows you to enter a name. The new group then appears in the list of groups. 
To associate users with a group, simply select the group in the list and check the desired users. 

Once the group is created, it can be set as the recipient of check error reports (in the general check settings).
