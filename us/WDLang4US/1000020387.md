Adds recipients for the notifications sent via the Control Centers (WDBal messaging tool). These notifications are sent by the HFSQL server when a problem occurs or when a possible optimization is detected. 

**Remark**: The sending performed via the Control Centers is using the parameters specified by [HNotifConfigure](../WDLang4/1000020390.md) (database of Control Centers, ...).

## Example


```wl
ctCSConnection is Connection
ctCSConnection.Provider = hAccessHFClientServer
ctCSConnection.User = "admin"
ctCSConnection.Password = ""
ctCSConnection.Server = "test:4900"
HOpenConnection(ctCSConnection)

HNotifConfigure(ctCSConnection, hNotifCCCS, "DOC:4988", "CC_DOC", "DOC", "")
HNotifAddCCRecipient(ctCSConnection, "Vince", hNotifWarning)
```

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = HNotifAddCCRecipient(<Connection> , <Recipient> , <Minimum level>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the recipient was added. 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) is used to identify the error.




**`<Connection>: (Character string or Connection variable)`**

Connection to use. This connection corresponds to: 

- the name of the connection defined in the data model editor or with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

- the name of a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md). 




**`<Recipient>: (Character string)`**

Name of the recipient. This name must correspond to a user defined in the database of Control Centers. 

**`<Minimum level>: (Integer constant)`**

Minimum level of gravity from which a notification is sent: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hNotifCritical* | The notifications will be sent from the critical level (for the critical and error problems).<br><br>Example of critical error: "Error while preparing the replica on the master." |
| *hNotifError* | The notifications will be sent for the error problems only.<br><br>Example of error: "The statistical file for server activity is damaged. It will be reinitialized." |
| *hNotifInformation* | The notifications will be sent from the information level (for the information, warning, critical and error problems)<br><br>Exemples of information: <br><br>- During the automatic server update: <br><br>	- "The server will be stopped for update. Another notification will be added after the update."<br><br>	- "The server was updated to version XXX."<br><br><br><br><br>- During the search for necessary keys on a database in exploitation. <br><br><br> |
| *hNotifWarning* | The notifications will be sent from the warning level (for the warning, critical and error problems).<br><br>Example of warning: The XX server and the YY server have different times. The resolution of conflicts during the replication may be incorrect." |


The order of gravity is: 

- Information.

- Warning.

- Error.

- Critical.
