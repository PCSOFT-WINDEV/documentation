Deletes a replication between two HFSQL servers. This function must be run on a replication's master HFSQL server, or on an orphaned subscriber server.

### Deleting a replication identified by a hHRSConfig variable

`<Result> = HRSDeleteConfig(<Connection> , <Replication to delete> [, <Type of deletion>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the replication was deleted,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) is used to identify the error.




**`<Connection>: (Character string or Connection variable)`**

Connection to the HFSQL server on which the replication is performed. This connection corresponds to: 

- the name of the connection defined in the data model editor or with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

- the name of a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md).




**`<Replication to delete>: (hRSConfig variable)`**

Name of [hRSConfig](../WDLang4/1000020484.md) variable describing the replication to delete. 

**`<Type of deletion>: (Optional Integer constant)`**

Type of replication to delete: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hrsDefault* <br>(default value) | Deletes the replication only if the subscriber server is accessible. |
| *hrsIgnoreSubscriber* | Forces the deletion even if the other server cannot be contacted. In this case: <br><br>- the information regarding the replication will not be deleted from the subscriber server.  <br><br>- for a bidirectional replication, the replication will not be deleted from the other server. We advise you to perform this deletion from this server as well to avoid a useless memory consumption.<br><br><br> |
| *hrsSubscriber* | Forces the deletion of an orphan replication on the subscriber side. In this case, the [hRSConfig](../WDLang4/1000020484.md) variable can be retrieved by [HRSListConfig](../WDLang4/1000020497.md) associated with the *hrsSubscriber* constant.  |

Remark: Before version 190040, this parameter corresponded to a boolean (<u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> equivalent to the *hrsIgnoreSubscriber* constant and <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> equivalent to the *hrsDefault* constant).

### Deleting a replication identified by its identifier

`<Result> = HRSDeleteConfig(<Connection> , <Identifier> [, <Forced deletion>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the replication was deleted,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) is used to identify the error.




**`<Connection>: (Character string or Connection variable)`**

Connection to the HFSQL server on which the replication is performed. This connection corresponds to: 

- the name of the connection defined in the data model editor or with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

- the name of a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md).




**`<Identifier>: (Integer)`**

Identifier of replication to delete. This identifier corresponds to the **Identifier** property of the [hRSConfig](../WDLang4/1000020484.md) variable describing the replication.

**`<Forced deletion>: (Optional boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> to force the deletion even if the other server cannot be contacted. In this case: 

	- the information regarding the replication will not be deleted from the subscriber server.  

	- for a bidirectional replication, the replication will not be deleted from the other server. We advise you to perform this deletion from this server as well to avoid a useless memory consumption.  .  




- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> (default value) to delete the replication only if the subscriber server is accessible.
