## Syntax

`<Result> = <Connection>.ModifyServerRights(<User/Group> , <Rights to modify> , <New values>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the rights have been modified, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) is used to identify the error. No modification is performed if the new value is already assigned to the specified rights.




**Remark**: [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) will return an "Unknown user" or "Unknown group" error if the current user does not have the rights to see the users (*hRightsSeeUser* constant) and if he wants to get information about another user or another group.

**`<Connection>: (Connection variable)`**

Name of the [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md) variable that describes the connection for which the rights of a user or group of users must be modified.

**`<User/Group>: (Character string)`**

Name of the user or group whose rights must be modified.

**`<Rights to modify>: (Integer constant (or combination of constants))`**
