Deletes all records from a data file, an HFSQL view or a query. The records are deleted logically and physically. They cannot be restored.

The following operations are performed:

- the records are deleted: the records are not referenced in the index anymore. The data is not kept.

- the indexes (corresponding to the keys of the records) are deleted from the index file.

- the memos associated with the records are deleted from the memo file.

- the automatic identifiers are re-initialized.


Caution: the integrity is not checked.

WINDEV, WINDEV Mobile and WEBDEV propose an automatic management of errors for the following types of errors: Duplicate error, integrity error, password error, modification conflict error and status error during modification conflict, lock error. For more details, see [Assisted HFSQL error handling](../WDLang4/3044188.md).

![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This function is available for the data files or queries linked to an HFSQL connection (Classic or Client/Server).

## Syntax

`<Result> = HDeleteAll(<Data file>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the records have been deleted,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if a problem occurred (locked record, record in transaction, ...). [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) is used to identify the error.




**`<Data file>: (Character string)`**

Name of HFSQL data file, HFSQL view or query used.

## Remarks


### Deleting records from a query
<a name="deleting_records_from_query_ELTPARAGRAPHE000106"></a>

If the query was created by using the *hModifyFile* constant, **HDeleteAll** deletes the records from the source of the query.
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Deleting records from an HFSQL view
<a name="deleting_records_from_hfsql_view_ELTPARAGRAPHE000117"></a>

**HDeleteAll** deletes the records from the view but it does not delete the records from the data file used for the view.
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Deleting records from a transaction
<a name="deleting_records_from_transaction_ELTPARAGRAPHE000128"></a>

**HDeleteAll** does not delete the records found in a transaction (canceled or validated).
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Benefits compared to a loop for deleting records
<a name="benefits_compared_loop_for_deleting_records_ELTPARAGRAPHE000139"></a>

To delete the records from a data file, you can also set a loop for deleting the records ([HDelete](../WDLang4/3044018.md)). For example:

```wl
FOR EACH CustNum OF Orders
	HDelete()
END
```
 Using **HDeleteAll** has the following advantages:

- the process is faster, 

- the size of empty data file is smaller.

### Advantage compared to [HCreation](../WDLang4/3044255.md)
<a name="advantage_compared_hcreationwdlang43044255md_ELTPARAGRAPHE000163"></a>

To delete the records from a data file, you also have the ability to use [HCreation](../WDLang4/3044255.md). 

Using **HDeleteAll** has the following advantages:

- Deletion possible even if users are connected to the data file.

- Automatic management of HFSQL errors.
