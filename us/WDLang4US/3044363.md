The **HCS.Timeout** variable is used to modify the connection timeout:

- for the connections established by [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

- for the automatic connection openings.




**Remark**: The **HCS.Timeout** variable is ignored for the accesses to the server other than the connection. A request whose execution is longer than the value specified in the **HCS.Timeout** variable would not be interrupted for example..

This timeout must be specified in the client application, before opening a connection on the server.

## Syntax

`HCS.Timeout = <Value>`
---

**`<Value>: (Integer constant, Integer or Duration)`**

Value of connection timeout. Corresponds to a timeout in milliseconds (greater than 500) or to one of the following preset constants: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *Internet* | Timeout used for the connection: Value suited for Internet (long response time) |
| *Intranet* | Timeout used for the connection: Value suited for Intranet (short response time) |


This parameter can correspond to: 

- an integer corresponding to the number of milliseconds,

- a Duration variable,

- the duration in a readable format (e.g., '1s' or '10ms').
