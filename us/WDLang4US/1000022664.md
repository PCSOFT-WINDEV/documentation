## Example


```wl
// Describe the connection
MyConnection is Connection

// Disable the management of audit logs for the server
MyConnection.SetServer(hLogLevel, "")

## Remarks


### Dynamic load balancing
<a name="dynamic_load_balancing_ELTPARAGRAPHE000861"></a>

The coefficients are used to modify the importance of each counter in the formula for calculating the load generated by a user on the server.

- A value equal to 1, 0 or -1 does not modify the coefficient.

- A value greater than 100 is equivalent to 100.

- A value less than -100 is equivalent to -100.



<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Managing logs
<a name="managing_logs_ELTPARAGRAPHE000875"></a>

The information about the logs can be modified without restarting the server. We advise you to modify the path of logs before they are enabled. Otherwise, the logs will be written in the default directory between the activation and the change of path.
