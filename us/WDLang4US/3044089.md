Disables a trigger. Then, this trigger can be re-enabled by [HActivateTrigger](../WDLang4/3044155.md).

**Reminder**: A trigger is a WLanguage procedure automatically called by the HFSQL engine whenever an HFSQL function is run. A trigger is defined by [HDescribeTrigger](../WDLang4/3044074.md). For more details, see [Managing the triggers](../WDLang4/3044271.md).

## Example


```wl
// In the initialization code of the project
Local
	TriggerResult is boolean
// Create a trigger for the all the analysis data files
TriggerResult = HDescribeTrigger("*", "HADD,HMODIFY," + ...
		"HDELETE, HCROSS,HWRITE", "CheckUserRights", hTriggerBefore)
// "CheckUserRights" is a global procedure of the project
IF TriggerResult = False THEN
	Error("Error on a trigger: " + HErrorInfo)
	RETURN
END
...
// Disables the trigger for all the data files
// On HDelete and HCross
HDeactivateTrigger("*", "HDELETE,HCROSS")
```

## Syntax

`<Result> = HDeactivateTrigger([<List of data files> [, <List of functions>]] [, <Type>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the operation was performed, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if a problem occurs. [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) is used to identify the error.




**`<List of data files>: (Optional character string)`**

Logical name of one or more data files. 
To specify several names of data files, the names of the data files must be separated by a comma (","). 
To use all the data files found in the analysis, this parameter must be equal to "\*".

By default, all the data files are taken into account.

**`<List of functions>: (Optional character string)`**

Name of one or more HFSQL or TableXXX functions on which the trigger must be implemented. To specify several names of functions, the names of functions must be separated by a comma (","). You have the ability to define triggers on the following HFSQL functions:

- [HModify](../WDLang4/3044042.md)

- [HAdd](../WDLang4/3044147.md)

- [HDelete](../WDLang4/3044018.md)

- [HWrite](../WDLang4/3044092.md)

- [HCross](../WDLang4/3044121.md)


If &lt;List of functions&gt; is set to "\*", all the HFSQL functions that can activate a trigger are taken into account.

By default, all the HFSQL functions that can activate a trigger are taken into account.

**`<Type>: (Optional Integer constant)`**

Indicates the type of trigger. All triggers are affected if this parameter is not specified.


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hTriggerAfter* | The procedure is run after the HFSQL function. |
| *hTriggerBefore* | The procedure is run before the HFSQL function. |
