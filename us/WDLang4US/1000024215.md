Describes a data file through programming.

After the call to **&lt;Source&gt;.DescribeFile**:

- the data file can be used like any other file described in the analysis.

- the description of the data file cannot be modified anymore.

- the description variable of the data file is reinitialized. A new description of data file can be performed.




To cancel the description of a data file through programming, use [&lt;Source&gt;.CancelDeclaration](../WDLang4/1000024192.md).

## Example

<a name="3044206_Example2"></a>

```wl
AFileDescription is File Description
AnItem is Item Description
dsSource is Data Source 
 
// Describe the "CUSTOMER" data file
AFileDescription.Name = "CUSTOMER"
AFileDescription.Type = hFileNormal
AFileDescription.FicCryptMethod = hEncryptionStandard
 
// Description of the "LASTNAME" item
AnItem.Name = "LASTNAME"
AnItem.Type = hItemText
AnItem.Size = 40
AnItem.KeyType = hUniqueKey
HDescribeItem(AFileDescription, AnItem)
 
// Describe the "FIRSTNAME" item
AnItem.Name = "FIRSTNAME"
AnItem.Type = hItemText
AnItem.Size = 40
HDescribeItem(AFileDescription, AnItem)
 
// Validate the data file description
dsSource.DescribeFile(AFileDescription)

HCreation(dsSource)

## Syntax

### Describing a data file through programming using a data source

`<Result> = <Data source>.DescribeFile(<Data file>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the description of the data file is valid and if it can be used,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if a problem occurs. [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) is used to identify the error.




**`<Data source>: (Data Source variable)`**

Name of the [Data source](../WDLang4/1514053.md) variable associated with the data file.

**`<Data file>: (File Description variable)`**

Name of the [File Description](../WDLang4/1514065.md) variable (see the Notes paragraph) used to describe the data file. The name of the data file will be defined with the [Name](../Proprietes/2510082.md) property.

### How to describe a data file through programming? 
<a name="how_describe_data_file_through_programming_ELTPARAGRAPHE000240"></a>

To describe a data file through programming, you must:

1. Declare a variable of type [Data source](../WDLang4/1514053.md). 

2. Use the [File Description](../WDLang4/1514065.md), [Item Description](../WDLang4/1514071.md), [Link description](../WDLang4/1514039.md) and [FullTextIndex Description](../WDLang4/1000017461.md) variables (if necessary).

3. Describe the characteristics of the data file, items, links and full-text indexes (if necessary) via the HFSQL properties.

4. Define the description of items with [HDescribeItem](../WDLang4/3044233.md).

5. Define the description of full-text indexes with [HDescribeFullTextIndex](../WDLang4/1000017407.md).

6. Associate the data file description with the data source (**&lt;Source&gt;.DescribeFile**, syntax 2) and links if necessary ([HDescribeLink](../WDLang4/3044191.md)).




Remark: This solution allows associating the data file described to a data source. In this case, when this variable is deleted, the data file will also be deleted.  
Caution: To use this syntax, you must use an "automatic" data source. For more details, see [Project description: Compilation tab](../Editeurs/9500218.md).
