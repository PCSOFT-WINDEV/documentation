`<Result> = HRSInfo(<Connection>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Character string)`**

Information regarding the different replications performed on this server. This information has the following format:  


```txt
<Server role> + TAB + <Server identifier> + TAB + <Port> + TAB + <Priority>
```
where: 

- &lt;Server role&gt; corresponds to an integer constant used to find out the role of the server in the replication: 
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hrsInactive* | Inactive computer in the replication between HFSQL servers. |
| *hrsMaster* | Master computer in the replication between HFSQL servers. |
| *hrsMaster* + *hrsSubscriber* | Master and subscriber computers in the replication between HFSQL servers (for a bi-directional replication). |
| *hrsSubscriber* | Subscriber computer in the replication between HFSQL servers. |



- &lt;Server identifier&gt; corresponds to the number used to identify the current HFSQL server among all the servers taking part in a replication.

- &lt;Port&gt; corresponds to the TCP/IP port used for the communication between servers.

- &lt;Priority&gt; corresponds to the priority number of the server used in case of resolution by priority during a modification conflict.




**`<Connection>: (Character string or Connection variable)`**

Connection to the HFSQL server. This connection corresponds to: 

- the name of the connection defined in the data model editor or with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

- the name of a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md).
