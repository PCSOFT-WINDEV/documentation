Modifies the rights granted to a user or to a group for a HFSQL Client/Server database.

## Example


```wl
// Copy the rights from a user to another one
sRights is string

HModifyDatabaseRights(MyConnection, "Moore", hRightsRead + hRightsInsert, sRights, "MyDatabase")
```

## Syntax

`<Result> = HModifyDatabaseRights(<Connection> , <User or group> , <Rights to modify> , <New values> , <Database>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the rights have been modified, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) is used to identify the error. 


No modification is performed if the new value is already assigned to the specified rights.

**Remark**: [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) will return an "Unknown user" or "Unknown group" error if the current user does not have the rights to see the users (*hRightsSeeUser* constant) and if he wants to get information about another user or another group.

**`<Connection>: (Character string or Connection variable)`**

Connection for which the rights granted to a user or to a group of users must be modified. This connection corresponds to: 

- the name of the connection defined in the data model editor or with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

- the name of a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md). 




**`<User or group>: (Character string)`**

Name of the user or group whose rights must be modified.

**`<Rights to modify>: (Integer constant (or combination of constants))`**

| *hAllowed* | The relevant rights are granted to the user or group. |

## Remarks


### When are rights changed? 
<a name="when_are_rights_changed_ELTPARAGRAPHE000275"></a>

The change is effective as soon as **HModifyDatabaseRights** is run. There is no need to restart the server to take the new rights into account.

**Managing duplicates and integrity**: The error does not occur when the management mode is modified but when an attempt is made not to comply with the integrity constraint (or with the duplicate constraint).
