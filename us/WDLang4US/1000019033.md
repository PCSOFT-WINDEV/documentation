## Functions for managing an HFSQL cluster
<a name="functions_for_managing_hfsql_cluster_ELTTEXTE000066"></a>
The following functions are used to manage an HFSQL cluster:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [HClusterAddNode](../WDLang4/1000019061.md) | Enables a node in an HFSQL cluster. |
| [HClusterDeleteNode](../WDLang4/1000019062.md) | Disables a node in a HFSQL cluster. |
| [HClusterIgnoreSynchro](../WDLang4/1000019243.md) | Defines a node of the HFSQL cluster as data source to perform the cluster synchronization. |
| [HClusterMasterNode](../WDLang4/1410087885.md) | Returns the name of the master node in an HFSQL cluster. |
| [HClusterNodeInfo](../WDLang4/1000019060.md) | Returns the status of each cluster node by interrogating the coordinator. |
| [HClusterParameter](../WDLang4/1000019305.md) | Reads and modifies the parameters of an HFSQL cluster. |
| [HClusterStart](../WDLang4/1000019057.md) | Starts an HFSQL cluster. This cluster was stopped beforehand (by [HClusterStop](../WDLang4/1000019058.md) for example). |
| [HClusterState](../WDLang4/1000019059.md) | Returns the status of an HFSQL cluster by interrogating its coordinator. |
| [HClusterStop](../WDLang4/1000019058.md) | Suspends the execution of an HFSQL cluster. The nodes of the cluster will no longer accept any connection from the client applications. |
| [HClusterSynchronizationErrorInfo](../WDLang4/1000021975.md) | Returns the error that occurred during the previous synchronization step of HFSQL cluster. |
| [HClusterSynchronizationInfo](../WDLang4/1000021974.md) | Returns the progress of synchronization for a node of an HFSQL cluster. |





You also have the ability to use the following functions: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [HDeleteParameter](../WDLang4/1000017315.md) | Deletes a parameter previously saved by [HSaveParameter](../WDLang4/1000017313.md). |
| [HLoadParameter](../WDLang4/1000017314.md) | Reads a parameter that was saved from a stored procedure by [HSaveParameter](../WDLang4/1000017313.md). |
| [HSaveParameter](../WDLang4/1000017313.md) | Saves a persistent value on the HFSQL server. |

| **Caution**: <br>A specific setup package is required to use HFSQL Cluster. <br>This pack can be downloaded at no extra cost on PC SOFT site, in the download section of modules common to version 28. |
