## Syntax

`<Result> = HSecurity([<Data file>, ] <Security level>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**

Former security level (before running **HSecurity**). 

**`<Data file>: (Optional character string)`**

Name of the data file used. 
If this name is not specified, **HSecurity** handles all the data files described in the analysis.
![Hyper File 5.5](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HF55.png) This parameter is ignored. The security is enabled for all the data files found in the current analysis.

**`<Security level>: (Integer or boolean)`**

Requested security level:

- 0 or <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> (by default): the security mechanism is disabled. The speed of the write-to-file operations is maximum.

- 1 or <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>: The security mechanism is enabled: The speed of the write-to-file operations is slower than when using HSecurity(0) but the security is ensured when writing into the data files.

- 2: Maximum security mechanism: The speed of write-to-file operations is slower than when using HSecurity(1).

## Remarks


### HSecurity and [HFlush](../WDLang4/3044004.md)
<a name="docparampagetitleshort_and_hflushwdlang43044004md_ELTPARAGRAPHE000110"></a>

**HSecurity** and [HFlush](../WDLang4/3044004.md) can both be used to force a physical write operation on disk.

However:

- **HSecurity** forces the data file(s) to be written. This write operation is automatically performed by the HFSQL engine. The data files used are not closed during this write operation. The speed of the write-to-file operation is slower.

- [HFlush](../WDLang4/3044004.md) is used to force a write operation into the data files handled during the call to this function. The data files used are closed then re-opened during this write operation. The speed of the write-to-file operation is not slowed down.
