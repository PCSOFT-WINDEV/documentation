| [SQLListTable](../WDLang4/3072021.md) | List all the tables that can be accessed by the connected database system. |
| [SQLLock](../WDLang4/3072003.md) | Used to lock:<br><br>- The entire data table, in read and write mode. Its data cannot be accessed by other computers.<br><br>- The records selected by the query.
