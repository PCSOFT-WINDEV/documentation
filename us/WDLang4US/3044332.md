## Syntax

`<Result> = HDeleteDatabase(<Connection> [, <Database>] [, <Options>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the database was deleted, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if an error occurred. [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) is used to identify the error.




**`<Connection>: (Character string or Connection variable)`**

Connection for which the database must be deleted. This connection corresponds to: 

- the name of the connection defined in the data model editor or with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

- the name of a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md).




**`<Database>: (Optional character string)`**

Name of the database to delete. 
If this parameter is not specified, the database defined in the connection will be used. A WLanguage error occurs if no database is defined in the connection.

**`<Options>: (Optional Integer constant (or combination of constants))`**

By default, when deleting the database, the files corresponding to the logs are not deleted and the files corresponding to the transactions are deleted. This parameter is used to modify this behavior:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hDeleteLog* | Deletes the log files and all logged operations. |
| *hKeepTRS* | Stores the transaction files. |
