## Syntax

`<Result> = <Source>.State([<Record number>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer constant)`**

Status of record: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hStateActive* | The record is active. |
| *hStateCrossed* | The record is crossed. |
| *hStateDel* | The record is deleted. |
| *hStateInvalid* | Record status not found (error). |



**`<Source>: (Type corresponding to the specified source)`**

Name of the data file used. 

**`<Record number>: (Optional integer)`**

Number of the sought record. If this number is not specified (or is equal to 0), **&lt;Source&gt;.State** will handle the current record. The current record is not read again.

## Remarks


### Record number not specified
<a name="record_number_not_specified_ELTPARAGRAPHE000248"></a>

**&lt;Source&gt;.State** reads no record if &lt;Record number&gt; is not specified.

In a network application, we advise you to read the record again before the call to **&lt;Source&gt;.State** to make sure that the record was not deleted. With [&lt;Source&gt;.Read](../WDLang4/1000025019.md) for example:

```wl
FileName.Read(hRecNumCurrent)
```

### Data files in Hyper File 5.5 format
<a name="data_files_hyper_file_55_format_ELTPARAGRAPHE000277"></a>

With the Hyper File 5 engine, the record must be read again in order for its status to be refreshed. Indeed, if the record is not read again after [&lt;Source&gt;.Delete](../WDLang4/1000025071.md) or [&lt;Source&gt;.Cross](../WDLang4/1000025051.md), **&lt;Source&gt;.State** always returns *hStateActive*.

This operating mode is no longer available in the HFSQL Classic engine. Once [&lt;Source&gt;.Delete](../WDLang4/1000025071.md) or [&lt;Source&gt;.Cross](../WDLang4/1000025051.md) was used on the current record, **&lt;Source&gt;.State** returns the current record status.

### xBase files
<a name="xbase_files_ELTPARAGRAPHE000315"></a>

[&lt;Source&gt;.Delete](../WDLang4/1000025071.md) and [&lt;Source&gt;.Cross](../WDLang4/1000025051.md) have the same effect: the record is crossed but it is not deleted. Therefore, the record can be re-enabled using [&lt;Source&gt;.Modify](../WDLang4/1000025038.md). 

In this case, **&lt;Source&gt;.State** returns the *hStateCrossed* constant for a deleted record (instead of *hStateDel*).
