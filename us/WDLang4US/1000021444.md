The **hScheduleMaterializedView** type is used to programmatically manage a task for recalculating the data of a scheduled materialized view on an HFSQL server. 
The characteristics of this task can be defined and changed using different WLanguage properties.

**Remarks**: 

- For more details on materialized views, see [Materialized view](../WDLang4/9000159.md). 

- For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

## Example


```wl
// Refresh the materialized views every Saturday at 23:00
refreshView is hScheduleMaterializedView
refreshView.Description = "View data recalculation"

// Characteristics of the scheduling
refreshView.Scheduling.Month = "*"
refreshView.Scheduling.DayOfWeek = "Saturday"
refreshView.Scheduling.Hour = "23"
refreshView.Scheduling.Minute = "0"

// Add the materialized view to refresh

// Syntax 1: 
// Refreshes all the materialized views of "MyDatabase"
refreshView.View[1] = "MyDatabase" 

// Syntax 2: 
// Refreshes "MyView" of "MyDatabase"
refreshView.View[1] = "MyDatabase/MyView" 

HAddScheduling(cnt, refreshView)
```

### Properties specific to hScheduleMaterializedView variables
<a name="properties_specific_hschedulematerializedview_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000036"></a>

The following properties can be used to handle a task for recalculating the data of a materialized view:

| Property name | Type used | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Description | Character string | Description associated with the data recalculation task of a materialized view. |
| Enabled | Boolean | <br><br>- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the data recalculation scheduling is enabled,<br><br>- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise.<br><br><br> |
| Identifier | Integer | Identifier of the data recalculation task of materialized views. <br><br>**This property is read-only**. |
| Scheduling | [hScheduling](../WDLang4/1000018853.md) variable | Characteristics of the scheduling to be established to recalculate the content of materialized views. |
| User | Character string | User who created the materialized view recalculation scheduling task.<br><br>This property is read-only. |
| View | Array of strings | List of materialized views whose task will recalculate the content. These views have been created: <br><br>- in the data model editor, <br><br>- via the SQL ["CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW"](../Editeurs/2034001.md) command. <br><br><br>To refresh all the materialized views of "MyDatabase", the syntax is as follows: <br><br><pre><code>refreshView.View[1] = "MyDatabase"</code></pre><br><br><br>To refresh "MyView" of "MyDatabase", the syntax is as follows: <br><br><pre><code>refreshView.View[1] = "MyDatabase/MyView"</code></pre><br> |
