// Start transactions
HTransactionStart(MyConnection)

// Actions A

// Declare a savepoint
HTransactionSavepoint(MyConnection, "MySavepoint")

// Actions B

// Undo all actions after the declaration of MySavepoint
HTransactionRollbackToSavepoint(MyConnection, "MySavepoint")

// Actions C

// Declare a savepoint
HTransactionSavepoint(MyConnection, "MySavepoint2")

// Actions D

// Validate (commit) transactions
// Actions A, C and D are taken into account, 
// but not B actions because they are between HTransactionSavepoint() 
// and HTransactionRollbackToSavepoint

HTransactionEnd(MyConnection)

// MySavepoint2 is disabled
