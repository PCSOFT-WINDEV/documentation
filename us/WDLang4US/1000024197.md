Locks a record and restricts the access to this record for all the other applications. Then, the record can be unlocked by [&lt;Source&gt;.UnlockRecNum](../WDLang4/1000024212.md).

**Remark**: Several cases may occur after the call to **&lt;Source&gt;.LockRecNum**:

- The record is already locked by another application: the lock cannot be performed.

- The data file containing the record is entirely locked: the lock cannot be performed.


An [automatic management of lock errors and modification conflicts](../WDLang4/3044188.md) is performed by default (except in the code of stored procedures). This assisted management of errors can be customized or disabled at any time by [&lt;Source&gt;.OnError](../WDLang4/1000025073.md).

[HErrorLock](../WDLang4/3044099.md) returns <u><u><u>True</u></u></u> if a lock problem occurs.

**Caution**: **&lt;Source&gt;.LockRecNum** must be used with great care: when locked, the record is not read again. Therefore, it may have been deleted or modified since the last access to this record. It is recommended to use [&lt;Source&gt;.Read](../WDLang4/1000025019.md) with a lock option.

![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This function is available for HFSQL data files only. It is not available for the data files accessed by JDBC.

## Example


```wl
// Lock a record in the Customer data file
Customer.LockRecNum(hRecNumCurrent, hLockReadWrite)
// Process on the record
...
// Restore access to the record
Customer.UnlockRecNum()
```

## Syntax

`<Result> = <Source>.LockRecNum([<Record to lock>] [, <Lock>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the operation was performed,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if a problem occurs. [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) is used to identify the error.




**`<Source>: (Type corresponding to the specified source)`**

Name of the data file used. 

**`<Record to lock>: (Optional integer)`**

Number of the record to lock. 
If this parameter is not specified, **&lt;Source&gt;.LockRecNum** will handle the current record.

![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) **&lt;Source&gt;.LockRecNum** locks the current record only. You cannot specify a record number other than the current one (to specify the current record number, use the *hRecNumCurrent* constant).

**`<Lock>: (Optional integer constant)`**

Used to define the type of lock set on the record.


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hLockNo* | **No lock**: the record can be read or modified by another application. |
| *hLockReadWrite* | **Lock in read/write**: the record in the data file cannot be read or modified by another application. <br>The other application will not be able to lock the record or the data file. |
| *hLockWrite*<br>(default value) | **Lock in write mode**: the record in the data file can be read, but cannot be modified by another application.<br>The other application will not be able to lock the record or the data file. |

## Remarks


### Modifying the type of lock for a record
<a name="modifying_the_type_lock_for_record_ELTPARAGRAPHE000336"></a>

To modify the type of record lock, call **&lt;Source&gt;.LockRecNum** and specify the requested type of lock. There is no need to unlock the record beforehand.
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Effect of lock mode
<a name="effect_lock_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000348"></a>

If the data file lock mode is set to *hModeMono* (see [&lt;Source&gt;.Mode](../WDLang4/1000025037.md)), **&lt;Source&gt;.LockRecNum** has no effect.
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Lock failure
<a name="lock_failure_ELTPARAGRAPHE000365"></a>

If the record is already locked, the lock request is retried HNbRetry times (50 by default).

If the data file cannot be locked after H.NbRetry attempts, [HErrorLock](../WDLang4/3044099.md) returns <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>. The H.Level variable indicates whether the record or the data file is locked.
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Number of locks
<a name="number_locks_ELTPARAGRAPHE000384"></a>

The number of records that can be individually locked in a data file is unlimited.

### Native SQL Server Connector: Lock in write mode
<a name="native_sql_server_connector_lock_write_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000396"></a>

**&lt;Source&gt;.LockRecNum** locks the record in write mode, not in read-only. Therefore, **&lt;Source&gt;.LockRecNum** prevents the record from being modified by another computer.

**&lt;Source&gt;.LockRecNum** used on a locked record does NOT return a lock error (because only a read operation is performed).

However, [&lt;Source&gt;.Modify](../WDLang4/1000025038.md) will return a lock error on the locked record.

### Managing locks in OLE DB
<a name="managing_locks_ole_ELTPARAGRAPHE000423"></a>

**&lt;Source&gt;.LockRecNum** is not supported. This function generates the non-fatal error "Invalid operation for this type of database".

### Persistence of lock
<a name="persistence_lock_ELTPARAGRAPHE000437"></a>

With the Native SQLServer and Sybase Connectors, re-reading a record that was locked by **&lt;Source&gt;.LockRecNum** unlocks the record.
