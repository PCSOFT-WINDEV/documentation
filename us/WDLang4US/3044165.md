Opens an xBase index file. The index file(s) of an xBase data file opened with [HDBOpen](../WDLang4/3044163.md) must be opened with **HDBIndex** to be used in WINDEV or WEBDEV. If the index files are not opened, they will not be updated when the file is written to.

Remark: there is no need to open the data file or the index files if the file was just created by [HDBCreation](../WDLang4/3044171.md).

## Syntax

`<Result> = HDBIndex(<Logical name of xBase file> , <Full name of index file> , <Key name>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the operation was performed, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if a problem occurs. [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) is used to identify the error.




**`<Logical name of xBase file>: (Character string)`**

Name given to the xBase file. This file was opened by [HDBOpen](../WDLang4/3044163.md).

**`<Full name of index file>: (Character string)`**

Access path to index file and full file name (with the extension)

**`<Key name>: (Character string)`**

Name of index key. This parameter is mandatory for the files in .NDX, .NTX and .IDX format (indeed, the name of the key does not appear in the file). It is useless and ignored for files in .MDX format (because the key name appears in the file).

### Name of the key 
<a name="name_the_key_ELTPARAGRAPHE000063"></a>

If the key is a calculated key (multiple), you must not specify all the items included the key, but any name that will be used in programming. For clarity, the name of the corresponding index file is often used.
