## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000147"></a>
Different types of replication are proposed:

- **the assisted replication**. This replication mode is used to easily define the records to replicate via ReplicEdit. Then, the records are replicated by ReplicSynchro. This replication mode uses the universal replication. Specific WLanguage functions are used to handle the replications.
	The assisted universal replication is available for the iOS and Android applications. For more details, see [Replication of mobile data (Android or iOS)](../WDLang4/1000021071.md). 

- **the universal replication**. The purpose of universal replication is to keep several databases synchronized. These databases can have different types (HFSQL, Oracle, ...). Universal replication uses a centralized model: all databases are synchronized with a master database. Then, the master database reflect the changes in the other databases. Several WLanguage functions are used to implement the universal replication.

- **log-based replication**. Log-based replication uses logs to keep the remote HFSQL databases up to date. Several WLanguage functions are used to implement log-based replication. You can also use [WDReplic](../WDReplic/3520016.md).

- **the replication between HFSQL servers**. This replication mode is used to update the data found on HFSQL servers linked 2 by 2.

- ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WDUniversalReplication.gif) ***Training (WINDEV)*** : **WD Universal Replication** <br>This examples explains how to use the universal replication to synchronize data of different sites.<br>The universal replication is used to synchronize the data of a site (master site) with the same data of one or more replicated sites (subscriber sites). The data structures are identical on each site but they can be exploited via different data managers. HFSQL Classic and Access will be used in this example.<br>The example presents the processes that must be included in your applications to allow the user, via a simple action (menu, button, ...), to:<br>- create a master replica, <br>- create one or more subscriber replicas, <br>- see and modify the data of these replicas, <br>- export the created or modified data to a site (portable replica), <br>- import the created or modified data into another site...
