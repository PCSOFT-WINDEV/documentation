Adds an integrity rule between two data files on the server. This integrity rule has been previously described by a variable of type [Link description](../WDLang4/1514039.md). All the client applications must comply with these integrity rules.

**Remark**: You have the ability to describe inter-database integrity rules.  

The addition will be effective for the application that performed it once the connection has been closed and re-opened.

## Example


```wl
// Describe the connection
MyConnection is Connection

// Describe the connection
MyConnection.User = "USER"
MyConnection.Password = "PASSWORD"
MyConnection.Server = "MYSERVER" 
MyConnection.Database = "Database"
MyConnection.Provider = hAccessHFClientServer
MyConnection.Access = hORead

// Open the connection
MyConnection.OpenConnection()
...
MyLink is link description
// Describe the "LIVES" link
MyLink.Name = "LIVES"
MyLink.SourceFile = ".\MyDatabase\city.fic"
MyLink.LinkedFile = ".\MyDatabase\customer.fic"
MyLink.SourceKey = "CITYNAME"
MyLink.LinkedKey = "CUSTCITY"
// Default link (0-1, 0-1)
MyConnection.AddLink(MyLink)
```

## Syntax

`<Result> = <Source connection>.AddLink([<Linked connection>, ] <Link>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the operation was performed, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if a problem occurs. [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) is used to identify the error.




**`<Source connection>: (Connection variable)`**

Name of the [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md) variable that describes the connection to which the link source file belongs.

**`<Linked connection>: (Optional character string or Connection variable)`**

Connection to which belongs the linked file of the link. This connection corresponds to: 

- the connection defined in the data model editor or with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [&lt;Connection variable&gt;.OpenConnection](../WDLang4/1000023962.md).

- a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md). 


If this parameter is not specified, both data files will belong to the same connection (&lt;Source connection&gt;).

**`<Link>: (Link Description variable)`**

Name of the [Link description](../WDLang4/1514039.md) variable containing the characteristics of the link to create.

## Remarks


### Link description
<a name="link_description_ELTPARAGRAPHE000257"></a>

In the link description, the names of the data files involved in the link ([SourceFile](../Proprietes/2512034.md) and [LinkedFile](../Proprietes/2512031.md) properties) must correspond to the physical names of the data files, relative to the Database used. The Database of each file is returned by &lt;Source connection&gt; and &lt;Linked connection>
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Miscellaneous
<a name="miscellaneous_ELTPARAGRAPHE000273"></a>

- [HDescribeLink](../WDLang4/3044191.md) is used to describe a temporary link on an ISAM database (not in Client/Server mode) or for the client application only (not on the server).

- [&lt;Connection variable&gt;.DeleteLink](../WDLang4/1000022759.md) is used to delete a link on the server.
