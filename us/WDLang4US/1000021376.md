## Syntax

`<Result> = HRefreshView(<Connection> , <View> [, <Option>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the materialized view was refreshed, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if an error occurred. [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) is used to identify the error.




**`<Connection>: (Character string or Connection variable)`**

Connection to use. This connection corresponds to: 

- the name of the connection defined in the data model editor or with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

- the name of a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md).




**`<View>: (Character string)`**

Name of materialized view whose data must be recalculated. This view was created: 

- via the data model editor. 

- via the SQL ["CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW"](../Editeurs/2034001.md) command.




**`<Option>: (Optional Integer constant)`**

Mode for refreshing the materialized view. 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hNoWait* | The refresh of materialized view is not a locking operation: it is performed in background task. [HInfoView](../WDLang4/1000021619.md) returns the information of the materialized view after being refreshed. |
| Parameter not specified (by default) | The refresh of materialized view is locking for the one who requested it. &lt;Result&gt; is used to find out the status report of refresh. |

## Remarks


### Necessary rights
<a name="necessary_rights_ELTPARAGRAPHE000123"></a>

To recalculate the content of materialized view, you must have: 

- the corresponding rights (*hRightsManageTask* constant) on the server,

- for each relevant database (which means containing a view to process), the rights to connect (*hRightsConnection* or *hRightsEncryptedConnection* constant). 




To find out whether these rights are granted to a user or to a group, use [HInfoServerRights](../WDLang4/3044322.md) or [HInfoDatabaseRights](../WDLang4/3044320.md).

To modify the rights granted to a user or to a group of users, use [HModifyServerRights](../WDLang4/3044328.md) or [HModifyDatabaseRights](../WDLang4/3044326.md).
