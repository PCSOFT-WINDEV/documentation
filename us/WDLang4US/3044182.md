## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000234"></a>
The following files are automatically created when logging an HFSQL Classic data file:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| **JournalOpération.Fic** | List of all the operations performed on the logged HFSQL data files used by the application. An operation corresponds to an HFSQL function. |
| **JournalIdentification.Fic** | List of the physical locations of all the logged files found in the application |
| **xxxJNL.Fic** | File created for each logged file. Contains the value of records used before and after each operation. |

This page presents the structure of these files.

|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| **ID_FichierJNL** | Identifier of the file used. |
| **GUID_Fichier_Source** | Unique identifier of logged file. This identifier is automatically assigned by the HFSQL engine to the file when creating the data file. |

### GUID and log process
<a name="guid_and_log_process_ELTPARAGRAPHE000123"></a>

Two types of file GUID are supported by the HFSQL engine:

- File GUID defined when the file was described in the data model editor. This GUID is used to manage the .REP.

- File GUID defined when creating the physical data file. This GUID is used by the log mechanism to detect that two data files do not use the same log file.
