<a name="XUse"></a>
<a name="Use"></a>
<a name="description"></a>
WLanguage procedure ("callback") called by [HTrack](../WDLang4/1000022407.md) when a change is made on the specified data file.
<a name="Example1"></a>
<a name="sample_code"></a>

## Example


```wl
// Starts tracking the Order data file
// The ProcessOrder procedure is called whenever a record is added to the data file
HTrack(Order, ProcessOrder, hRecNumAll, hsAdd)

PROCEDURE ProcessOrder(FileName, RecNum, Action)
IF BinaryAND(nAction, hsAdd) = hsAdd THEN
	Trace("An addition was made in the data file: " + FileName)
END
```

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`HTrack_Callback(<Modified data file> , <Record number> , <Action>)`
---

**`<Modified data file>: (Character string)`**

Name of the modified HFSQL data file. 

**`<Record number>: (Integer)`**

Number of the modified record (equivalent to the number returned by [HRecNum](../WDLang4/3044063.md)). 

**`<Action>: (Integer constant)`**

Action that triggered the procedure. The possible values are: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hsAdd* | Procedure started once a record is added into the data file. |
| *hsCross* | Procedure started once a record is crossed in the data file. |
| *hsDeletion* | Procedure started once a record is deleted from the data file. |
| *hsModification* | Procedure started once a record is modified in the data file. |


**Caution**: If a process adds a record modifies this record immediately after, [HTrack](../WDLang4/1000022407.md) is called once with a combination of the constants *hsAdd* and *hsModification*.
BinaryAND must be used to identify these actions in the WLanguage procedure. For example: 

```wl
IF BinaryAND(nAction, hsAdd) = hsAdd THEN ...
```

## Remarks


### WLanguage procedure executed in the main thread
<a name="wlanguage_procedure_executed_the_main_thread_ELTPARAGRAPHE000074"></a>

By default, this WLanguage procedure is called in the main thread of the application, with the HFSQL context that corresponds to the procedure:

- If the procedure is a local procedure of a window that uses an independent context, the window's context will be used. 

- If the procedure belongs to a component that uses an independent context, the context used will be the one of the component.

| **Caution**:<br>The procedure associated with [HTrack](../WDLang4/1000022407.md) can be called at any time in the application.<br>If the procedure reads records or moves between records in the data files, this will have an impact on the application (like the timers).<br>Therefore, you may have to call [HSavePosition](../WDLang4/3044136.md) and [HRestorePosition](../WDLang4/3044137.md) to save the contexts of files used.<br><br>[Multitask](../WDLang1/3015004.md) must not be used in the procedure code. |




### WLanguage procedure executed in a secondary thread
<a name="wlanguage_procedure_executed_secondary_thread_ELTPARAGRAPHE000234"></a>

If the WLanguage procedure is called in a secondary thread: 

- the HFSQL context is copied the first time **WLanguage procedure called by HTrack** is called. Only the directories containing the data files in HFSQL Classic mode and/or the connections in HFSQL Client/Server mode are stored.

- UI elements (windows, controls, etc.) cannot be manipulated in the secondary thread. When a secondary thread must interact with the user or update the UI, it must use a process started from the main thread. This process can correspond to:

	- a global procedure of the project or a local procedure (of a window, etc.) called by [ExecuteMainThread](../WDLang1/1000019862.md),

	- the event "Request for refreshing the display" of a window run by [RequestRefreshUI](../WDLang1/1000023899.md).
