The **mongoGridFS** type is used to define the advanced characteristics of a file system for a MongoDB database. The characteristics of this file system can be defined and modified by several WLanguage properties. 

**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

## Example


```wl
cntMDB is mongoConnection("mongodb://db1.example.net")
fs is mongoGridFS
fs.Database = cntMDB.Database["CRM"]
fs.Prefix = "myfs"
Trace(MongoGridFSListFile(fs))
```





## Declaration

<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`MyVariable is mongoGridFS(<Database>, <Prefix>)`
---

**`<Database>: (Character string)`**

MongoDB database containing the file system. 

**`<Prefix>: (Character string)`**

Prefix of collection. 
The files will be stored in the collections in the following format: **&lt;prefix&gt;.files** and **&lt;prefix&gt;.chunck**.

### Properties specific to mongoGridFS variables
<a name="properties_specific_mongogridfs_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000051"></a>

The following properties can be used to handle a MongoDB file system:

| Property name | Type used | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Database | [mongoDatabase](../WDLang4/1000022410.md) variable | Database containing the file system. |
| Prefix | Character string | Prefix of collection. <br><br>The files will be stored in the collections in the following format: **&lt;prefix&gt;.files** and **&lt;prefix&gt;.chunck**. |

### Functions that use the mongoGridFS type
<a name="functions_that_use_the_mongogridfs_type_ELTPARAGRAPHE000081"></a>The following functions use the mongoGridFS type: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [MongoGridFSDeleteFile](../WDLang4/1000022440.md) | Deletes a file identified by its name from a MongoDB file system. |
| [MongoGridFSDeleteFileByID](../WDLang4/1000022596.md) | Deletes a file identified by its identifier from a MongoDB file system. |
| [MongoGridFSGetFile](../WDLang4/1000022439.md) | Retrieves (on the local computer) a file identified by its name and found in a MongoDB file system. |
| [MongoGridFSGetFileByID](../WDLang4/1000022595.md) | Retrieves (on the local computer) a file identified by its identifier and found in a MongoDB file system. |
| [MongoGridFSGetFileInfo](../WDLang4/1000023495.md) | Allows you to get information about a MongoDB file (gridFS). |
| [MongoGridFSListFile](../WDLang4/1000022438.md) | Retrieves the list of MongoDB files found in the MongoDB file system (gridFS). |
| [MongoGridFSSendFile](../WDLang4/1000022436.md) | Copies a file from the local computer to a MongoDB file system (gridFS). |





**Remark**: These functions can also be used to handle a Mongo database. In this case, the prefix corresponds to the default value "fs". 

Prefix syntaxes are also available: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [&lt;mongoGridFS variable&gt;.DeleteFile](../WDLang4/1000025394.md) | Deletes a file identified by its name from a MongoDB file system. |
| [&lt;mongoGridFS variable&gt;.DeleteFileByID](../WDLang4/1000025395.md) | Deletes a file identified by its identifier from a MongoDB file system. |
| [&lt;mongoGridFS variable&gt;.GetFile](../WDLang4/1000025391.md) | Retrieves (on the local computer) a file identified by its name and found in a MongoDB file system. |
| [&lt;mongoGridFS variable&gt;.GetFileByID](../WDLang4/1000025392.md) | Retrieves (on the local computer) a file identified by its identifier and found in a MongoDB file system. |
| [&lt;mongoGridFS variable&gt;.GetFileInfo](../WDLang4/1000025393.md) | Used to get information about a MongoDB file (gridFS). |






- ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=NativeaccesstoMongoDB.gif) ***Unit examples (WINDEV)*** : **Native access to MongoDB** <br>This example shows how to use the main functions of native access to MongoDB databases: adding data, reading (searching), modifying and deleting data in the database. The example also shows functions for saving files in the MongoDB GridFS data system.
