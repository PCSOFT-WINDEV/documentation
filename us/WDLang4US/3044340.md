## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000164"></a>
The **HClient** structure is used to:

- disconnect one or more Client computers ([HDisconnectClient](../WDLang4/3044339.md))

- send a message to one or more Client computers ([HSendMessageToClient](../WDLang4/3044346.md))

### Variables of the structure
<a name="variables_the_structure_ELTPARAGRAPHE000066"></a>

The following variables are used to manage Client computers:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| HClient.Application | Character string.<br>Application name. <br>This name is returned by [HListConnectedUser](../WDLang4/3044291.md). |
| HClient.Database | Character string.<br>HFSQL Client/Server database. |
| HClient.File | Character string.<br>Data file. |
| HClient.Login | Character string<br>Username. |
| HClient.Computer | Character string.<br>Computer of the user: Name of the computer or IP address of the computer. |


The functions that use this structure will apply to the connections whose user is identified by the **HClient.Login** login and performed by a **HClient.Application** application. This application is run on the **HClient.Computer** computer and uses the **HClient.File** data file of the **HClient.Database** database.

Each variable in the structure can have a "" (empty string) value which means "any value".

<a name="NOTE3"></a>
<a name="NOTE3_1"></a>
