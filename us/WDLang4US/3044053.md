```

## Syntax

`<Result> = HNoModif(<Data file>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if no problem occurred, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) returns more details about the problem.


If the data file is still locked after [H.NbRetry](../WDLang4/3044075.md) attempts, [HErrorLock](../WDLang4/3044099.md) returns <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> (the H.Locked variable is set to <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>). 
If the data file was locked, [HErrorLock](../WDLang4/3044099.md) returns <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>.

**`<Data file>: (Character string)`**

Name of the data file used.

## Remarks


### Locks set by HNoModif
<a name="locks_set_docparampagetitleshort_ELTPARAGRAPHE000087"></a>

**HNoModif** can lock **in write mode** a file already locked by another program (with **HNoModif**). Therefore, several programs can forbid the modifications on the same data file at the same time. A locking read function run after **HNoModif** in the same program reads the record without locking it.

**HNoModif** cannot lock a data file already locked **in read/write** by another program.
Reminder: the data file cannot be locked by **HNoModif** only if the data file is locked in read/write by another program.

Remarks:

- In single-user mode ([HMode](../WDLang4/3044039.md)), **HNoModif** is equivalent to [HOpen](../WDLang4/3044120.md) (the data files are locked in read/write as soon as they are opened).

- You have the ability to lock a data file whose records are locked by another application.

### Miscellaneous
<a name="miscellaneous_ELTPARAGRAPHE000124"></a>

- The maximum number of programs that can request the no-modification policy on a data file depends on the size of a record in the data file. It can be calculated as follows: 
	
	```txt
	MaxNbSessionsOrPrograms = RecordSize - 20
	```


- This function is not available when using a database via .
