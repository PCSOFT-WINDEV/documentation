## Syntax

### Finding out the characteristics of Memo item

`<Result> = HInfoMemo(<Data file> , <Memo item>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Character string)`**



- Information about the binary memo. 

- Empty string ("") if the memo is empty.




The information is separated by TAB characters. This information is as follows: 

```txt
<Type>+TAB+<Name>+TAB+<Size>+TAB+<Date>+TAB+<Time>+TAB+<Info>
```



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Type of memo. This parameter can take the following values: "TXT" for the text memos, "IMG", "WAV", "OLE", "BIN" or "BAD" ("BAD" indicates that the binary memo is not stored properly) |
| Name | Name of source file as it was specified in [HLinkMemo](../WDLang4/3044173.md). |
| Size | Size of source file in bytes. For a text memo, this size is expressed in number of characters. |
| Date | Date of source file in "YYYYMMDD" format. |
| Time | Time of source file in "HHMMSS" format |
| Info | User information as it was specified in [HLinkMemo](../WDLang4/3044173.md) |


**If the memo is a text memo**, the name, the date, the time and the user information are not filled. The type is set to "TXT". 
Example of value returned by a text memo whose size is 25: "TXT"+TAB+TAB+25+TAB+TAB+TAB.

**If the memo is a binary memo** that was not assigned by [HLinkMemo](../WDLang4/3044173.md), the name, date, time and information are not specified. The type is set to "BIN". 
Example of value returned by a binary memo whose size is 1202: "BIN"+TAB+TAB+1202+TAB+TAB+TAB.
![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) The information about the memo will not be saved. The only information returned by **HInfoMemo** corresponds to: 

- the size of memo,

- an empty string ("") if there is no size. 


For example: "TXT" (or "BIN")+TAB+TAB+25+TAB+TAB+TAB.

**`<Data file>: (Character string)`**

Name of data file (query of view) used.

**`<Memo item>: (Character string)`**

Name of memo item to use.
