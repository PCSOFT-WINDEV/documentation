## Syntax

`<Result> = HModifyFileRights(<Connection> , <User/Group> , <Rights to modify> , <New values> , <Database> , <Data file>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the rights have been modified, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) is used to identify the error. 


No modification is performed if the new value is already assigned to the specified rights.

**Remark**: [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) will return an "Unknown user" or "Unknown group" error if the current user does not have the rights to see the users (*hRightsSeeUser* constant) and if he wants to get information about another user or another group.

**`<Connection>: (Character string or Connection variable)`**

Connection for which the rights granted to a user or to a group of users must be modified. This connection corresponds to: 

- the name of the connection defined in the data model editor or with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

- the name of a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md). 




**`<User/Group>: (Character string)`**

Name of the user or group whose rights must be modified.

**`<Rights to modify>: (Integer constant (or combination of constants))`**

**`<Database>: (Character string)`**

Name of the database containing the data file for which the rights must be modified. 

- If the database corresponds to the one defined in the connection, this parameter can correspond to an empty string ("").
