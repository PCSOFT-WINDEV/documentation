## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = HSuggestKey(<Connection> , <Queries> [, <Options>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Character string)`**

Message corresponding to the requested format. 

**`<Connection>: (Character string or Connection variable)`**

Connection to the HFSQL server containing the queries to be analyzed. This connection corresponds to:

- the name of the connection defined in the data model editor or with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

- the name of a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md).




**`<Queries>: (List of values enclosed in brackets and separated by commas)`**

List of queries to be analyzed (10 queries maximum). This list of queries has the following format: 


```txt
(<Query 1>, ..., <Query N>)
```
where: 

- &lt;Query 1&gt;: First query to be analyzed.

- ...

- &lt;Query N&gt;: Nth query to be analyzed.




Remark: It is possible to analyze queries created with the query editor, WLanguage queries or SQL queries. The different types of queries can be mixed in the list. 

**`<Options>: (Integer constant)`**

Allows you to configure the returned result: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hSKSimplified* not specified<br>(Default value) | &lt;Résultat&gt; is a readable message for the developer, containing the list of keys to be added to the data files in order to optimize the queries. This text uses RTF. |
| *hSKSimplified* specified | &lt;Result&gt; is the list of missing keys. If no key is needed, &lt;Result&gt; is an empty string. The list of missing keys has the following format: <br><br><pre><code><File 1> + TAB + <Key 1> + <EOT> + <Key 2> + ...<br> + <Key N> + CR + ... + CR + <File N> + TAB + <Key 1> + <br><EOT> + <Key 2> + ... + <Key N></code></pre><br> where: <br><br>- &lt;File N&gt; is the data file to be optimized. <br><br>- &lt;Key N&gt; is the name of the key to be added. <br><br><br> |

## Remarks


- The function takes a maximum of 10 queries as parameters. To accept more queries, it is recommended to use [HSuggestKeyStart](../WDLang4/1000025905.md) and [HSuggestKeyEnd](../WDLang4/1000025906.md).

- To analyze a query with a parameter, you must provide the value of the parameter before executing **HSuggestKey**. For example: 
	
	```wl
	MySELECT_PRODUCTqry is SQL Query = 
	[	
	SELECT * FROM PRODUCT
	WHERE PRODUCT.Reference = {pReference}
	]
	MySELECT_PRODUCTqry.pReference = 123
	let sListKey = HSuggestKey(MyConnection, (MySELECT_PRODUCTqry))
	```

	If no value is given for the query parameter(s), the query condition will not be taken into account. In that case, no keys will be suggested.

- Keys are suggested according to the data contained in the data file. If a data file contains no data, no key will be suggested.
