## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000753"></a>
When defining the connections in the data model editor or when defining the connections through programming, you have the ability to specifier the optional connection information. 

In the data model editor, this information is typed in the connection description, "Advanced" tab. 

Through programming, this extended information is configured: 

- via [ExtendedInfo](../Proprietes/2512041.md) used with [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md) variables. 

- via [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md) or [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md). 




This information is defined via the following keywords. 

**Caution**: This help page only presents the optional connection information available for the Native Connectors (also called Native Access) and for OLE DB.

| WD RECORD LOCK | Used to specify whether the management of locks is enabled (or not) on the connection.<br><br>- If "WD RECORD LOCK = WITH (NOLOCK)", the management of locks is disabled on the connection. In this case, the Native Connector adds "WITH (NOLOCK)" into all generated SELECT queries. Therefore, the selected records are not locked.<br><br>- If this option is not specified (default case), the management of locks is enabled on the connection. All the selected records are automatically locked.<br><br><br>**Caution**: "WD RECORD LOCK = WITH (NOLOCK)" is not used by default. Indeed, this option must be used with great care: the value of the records read may not correspond to the real value (if this value was recently modified by another computer for example).<br><br><br><pre><code>CnxProgress.InfosEtendues = ...<br>	"PORT=2800;" + ...<br>	"WD RECORD LOCK = WITH (NOLOCK);" + ...<br>	"WD CLIENT LIBRARY= C:\...\pgoe1022.dll"</code></pre><br><br><br>![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) This keyword is supported by the Native Progress Connector.<br><br>![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) Special cases: <br><br>- Sybase: The default value is "NOHOLDLOCK". <br><br>- SQL Server via OLE DB: The default value is "WITH (NOLOCK)". <br><br><br>For all other Native Connectors, the default value is empty (including the SQL Server connector via ODBC). |

| WD Unicode Support | Used to specify whether the management of the Unicode format is enabled (or not) on the connection.<br><br>If "WD Unicode Support = 0", the management of the Unicode format is disabled on the connection. All the values will be converted (if necessary) by the server into the default character set. In this case, the performance is improved but the Unicode items are not supported.<br><br>If "WD Unicode Support = 1" (default value), the management of the Unicode format is enabled on the connection. All the exchanges with the server will be performed in Unicode. The possible conversions are managed by the native connector.<br><br>![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) This keyword is supported by the Native SQL Server (via OLE DB or ODBC), MySQL and PostgreSQL Connectors. |
