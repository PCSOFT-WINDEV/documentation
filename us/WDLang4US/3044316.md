## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000079"></a>
Several HFSQL functions are used to manage the HFSQL Client/Server data.

These functions are mainly used to:

- Manage the users and the groups of users (creation, rights, ...)

- Manage the data files found on the server

- Manage the referential integrity (functions for managing the links)

- Manage the server.
