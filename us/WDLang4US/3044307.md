## Example


```wl
LockList is string
// Lists all the locks of the Customer data file
LockList = HInfoLock(Customer)
// Lists all the locks set on the data files of CSConnection
LockList = HInfoLock(CSConnection)
// Lists all the locks set on the Customer.fic data file of CSConnection
LockList = HInfoLock(CSConnection, ".\customer.fic")
```

## Syntax

### Information about the locks set on a data file identified by its name

`<Result> = HInfoLock(<Data file> [, <Record number>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Character string)`**



- Empty string ("") if there is no lock or if the data file used is not a HFSQL Client/Server data file.

- Information about the lock.  This information is separated by TAB characters and it has the following format:
	
	```txt
	<Physical name of the data file relative to the database> + TAB + 
	<Record number> + TAB + 
	<User> + TAB + <Name of client computer> + TAB + 
	<IP address of client computer> + TAB + <Name of client application> + TAB + 
	<Type of lock> + TAB + <Date of lock implementation> + TAB + 
	<Number of seconds since start of lock> + CR
	```


	- &lt;Record number&gt; is set to -1 if the lock was set on the data file.

	- The &lt;Type of lock&gt; parameter can correspond to:

		- W: Lock in write mode.

		- RW: Lock in read/write.

		- W-T: Lock in write mode set by a transaction.

		- RW-T: Lock in read/write set by a transaction.




- &lt;Start date of lock&gt; has the following format: YYYYMMDDHHmmSS. This date is in UTC format (Universal Time Coordinated).




**`<Data file>: (Character string)`**

Name of the data file used. 
If this parameter is an empty string (""), **HInfoLock** manipulates the last data file used by the last HFSQL function (function starting with "H").

**`<Record number>: (Optional integer)`**

Number of the record for which the lock information is requested. 
If this parameter is not specified, **HInfoLock** lists all the locks of the data file.

### Information about the locks set on a data file identified by its connection

`<Result> = HInfoLock(<Connection> [, <Data file path>] [, <Record number>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Character string)`**

Information about the lock. This information is separated by TAB characters and it has the following format:

```txt
<Physical name of file relative to the database> + TAB + <Record number> + 
TAB + <User> + TAB + <Name of client computer> + TAB + 
<IP address of client computer> + TAB + <Name of client application> + 
TAB + <Type of lock> + TAB + <Start date of lock> + TAB + 
<Nb of seconds since start of lock> + CR
```


- &lt;Record number&gt; is set to -1 if the lock was set on the data file.

- The &lt;Type of lock&gt; parameter can correspond to:

	- W: Lock in write mode.

	- W-T: Lock in write mode set by a transaction.

	- RW: Lock in read/write.

	- RW-T: Lock in read/write set by a transaction.




- &lt;Start date of lock&gt; has the following format: YYYYMMDDHHmmSS.




**`<Connection>: (Character string or Connection variable)`**

Connection for which the lock information is requested. This connection corresponds to: 

- the name of the connection defined in the data model editor or with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

- the name of a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md).


If this parameter is not a connection name, **HInfoLock** considers that it corresponds to the name of a data file.

**`<Data file path>: (Optional character string)`**

Full path of the data file, relative to the database defined by &lt;Connection&gt;. 
If the &lt;Connection&gt; parameter corresponds to the logical name of a data file, it is ignored. 
If this parameter is not specified, all the locks set on all the data files of the database are returned.

**`<Record number>: (Optional integer)`**

Number of the record for which the lock information is requested. 
If this parameter is not specified, **HInfoLock** lists all the locks of the data file.
