Link functions (prefix syntax) are used to link the interface with the data files (and vice versa). These functions are as follows:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [&lt;Page&gt;.FromFile](../WDLang4/1000021389.md) | Automatically updates the controls of a page with:<br><br>- the values of the bound items in the current record (loaded in memory) of the data file described in the data model editor. This operation is performed regardless of the state of the controls (grayed, inactive or invisible).<br><br>- the values of the bound WLanguage variables. This operation is performed regardless of the state of the controls (grayed, inactive or invisible).<br><br><br> |
