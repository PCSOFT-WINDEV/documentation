Defines the options used for the universal replication of a data file:

- the replication direction.

- the management mode of conflicts.




By default, all the data files use the synchronization characteristics defined by [HSynchronizeReplica](../WDLang4/3044014.md). **HRplManageFile** can be used to specify that the changes made to a given data file will be replicated from the master to the subscriber (replication will be bidirectional for all the other data files).

**This function can be used in universal replication only.**

## Syntax

`HRplManageFile(<File name> , <Management of conflicts> [, <Replication direction>])`
---

**`<File name>: (Character string)`**

Name of the data file to configure.

**`<Management of conflicts>: (Integer constant)`**

Constant indicating the management mode of conflicts:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *rplMasterFirst* | The data found in the master data file has priority during the replication. |
| *rplMostRecentFirst* | The most recent data has priority. Caution, the most recent data is evaluated according to the time on the subscriber replica. |
| *rplReplicationConflictManagement*<br>(default value) | The file will use the management mode of conflicts specified by [HSynchronizeReplica](../WDLang4/3044014.md). |
| *rplSubscriberFirst* | The data found in the subscriber data file has priority during the replication. |



**`<Replication direction>: (Optional integer constant)`**

Direction in which the replication will be performed:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *rplBidirectional* <br>(default value) | Update the master file AND the subscriber file. |
| *rplToMaster* | Update the master file according to the subscriber database. |
| *rplToSubscriber* | Update the subscriber file according to the master database. |
