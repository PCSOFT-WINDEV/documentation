## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = ReplicDeleteSubscription(<Replication name>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the replication subscription was deleted,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. For more details about the problem, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md).




**`<Replication name>: (Character string)`**

Name of the replication to use. This name corresponds to:

- the name of ".wer" file, created by ReplicEdit (for an online replication). This file must be found beside the executable.

- the publication name (for a replication server).

<a name="NOTE0_1"></a>

## Remarks


- The replication must have been opened by [ReplicOpen](../WDLang4/1000017194.md). 

- If the replication does not use the replication server (replication in direct mode), **ReplicDeleteSubscription** has no effect. 

- The local files associated with the replication are not deleted.
