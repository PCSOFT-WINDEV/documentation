<a name="description"></a>
Forces the operating system of the computer where the data files are found to write data onto the disk. The HFSQL context of the data file used is stored (lock, current browse, ...).

**Remark**: Used on a regular basis, this function minimizes the loss of data caused by the unexpected system outage on the computer where the data files are located (power failure for example).

![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This function is available for HFSQL data files only. It is not available for the data files accessed by JDBC.

## Example


```wl
// Add a record in a data file
// (record described through programming)
Customer.LastName = "Clark"
Customer.FirstName = "Vince"
Customer.Address = "Palm lane"
Customer.City = "San Francisco"
Customer.Zip = "94102"
Customer.Country = "USA"
HAdd(Customer)
// Forces a write operation into Customer file
HFlush(Customer)
```

## Syntax

`HFlush(<Data file>)`
---

**`<Data file>: (Character string)`**

Name of the data file used. 
If this name is not specified, **HFlush** will use the last data file used by the last HFSQL function (function starting with "H").
If this parameter corresponds to "\*", **HFlush** will be applied to all open data files.
**Caution**: In this case, the execution of function can be quite long.
This parameter can also correspond to the name of a [group of files (or custom-folder) defined in the analysis](../Editeurs/2011003.md) (not available in Android and Android widget).

### Managing locks
<a name="managing_locks_ELTPARAGRAPHE000102"></a>

During the call to **HFlush**, the data file used is closed and re-opened. If locks were implemented on this data file before it was closed, these locks are automatically restored when it is re-opened. Indeed, when closing a data file, the operating system deletes the locks implemented on this data file.

**Remark**: It is not advisable to call this function too often on:

- data files on which an important number of locks is implemented.

- data files on which an important number of write operations is implemented.

### HSecurity and HFlush
<a name="hsecurity_and_docparampagetitleshort_ELTPARAGRAPHE000120"></a>[HSecurity](../WDLang4/3044135.md) and **HFlush** can both be used to force a physical write operation on disk.

However:

- [HSecurity](../WDLang4/3044135.md) is used to force a write operation into the data files used during each write operation. This write operation is automatically performed by the HFSQL engine. The data files used are not closed during this write operation. The speed of the write-to-file operation is slower.

- **HFlush** forces the data file(s) to be written when it is called. The data files used are closed then re-opened during this write operation. The speed of the write-to-file operation is not slowed down.
