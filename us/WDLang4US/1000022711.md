```wl
// Describe the connection
MyConnection is Connection

// Copy the rights from a user to another one

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = <Connection>.ModifyViewRights(<User/Group> , <Rights to modify> , <New values> , <Database> , <View>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the rights have been modified, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) is used to identify the error. 


No modification is performed if the new value is already assigned to the specified rights.

**Remark**: [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) will return an "Unknown user" or "Unknown group" error if the current user does not have the rights to see the users (*hRightsSeeUser* constant) and if he wants to get information about another user or another group.

**`<Connection>: (Connection variable)`**

Name of the [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md) variable that describes the connection for which the rights of a user or group of users must be modified.

**`<User/Group>: (Character string)`**

Name of the user or group whose rights must be modified.

**`<Rights to modify>: (Integer constant (or combination of constants))`**

List of rights to modify:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hRightsChangeRights* | Rights to change rights. |
| *hRightsDelete* | Rights to delete records from a view. |
| *hRightsDeleteView* | Rights to delete a view. |
| *hRightsInsert* | Rights to add records to a view. |
| *hRightsMaintenance* | Rights to start a re-index operation or a statistical calculation on a materialized view. |
| *hRightsRead* | Rights to read the records of a view. |
| *hRightsUpdate* | Rights to modify the records of a view. |



**`<New values>: (Integer constants)`**

List of new values for the modified rights. New values must be assigned to all the rights specified in &lt;Rights to modify&gt; (in the same order).

If a single value is indicated in this parameter, it will be assigned to all the rights specified in &lt;Rights to modify&gt;.

The possible values are: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hAllowed* | The relevant rights are granted to the user or group. |
| *hForbidden* | The relevant rights are not granted to the user or group. |
| *hInherit* | The user will inherit from the value of the rights granted to the group to which he belongs. |



**`<Database>: (Character string)`**

Name of the database containing the SQL view or the materialized view for which the rights must be modified. 

- If the database corresponds to the one defined in the connection, this parameter can correspond to an empty string (""). 

- A WLanguage error occurs if no database is defined in the connection and if this parameter corresponds to an empty string.




**`<View>: (Character string)`**

Name of the SQL view or materialized view for which the rights must be modified.

## Remarks


### When are rights changed? 
<a name="when_are_rights_changed_ELTPARAGRAPHE000302"></a>

The change is effective as soon as **&lt;Connection variable&gt;.ModifyViewRights** is run. There is no need to restart the server to take the new rights into account.
