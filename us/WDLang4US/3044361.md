## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000288"></a>
When an HFSQL function fails (returns <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> for example), the corresponding error number is returned by [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md). You have the ability to process the error and to retry the operation.

This page presents the main errors of file management that can occur when using the Native Accesses. For each error, you will find:

- its number

- the details of the error




You will find the error codes common to all the Native Accesses, then the error codes specific to Native MySQL Access.

**Remark**: [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) returns the details of the last error that occurred when managing files via a Native Access.

## The different error codes common to all the Native Accesses
<a name="the_different_error_codes_common_all_the_native_accesses_ELTTEXTE000318"></a>
**1: The HFSQL engine and the Native Access are out-of-synch**
The HyperFileSQL engine and the Native Access are are not in synch anymore . The number of record items supplied by the HFSQL engine is invalid.

**2: The SQL engine and the Native Access are out-of-synch**
The SQL engine and the Native Access are out-of-synch. The type of query specified by the SQL engine is unknown to the Native Access. 

**4: Internal error in the Native Access**
A valid current record is required by the current operation. No current record is defined.

**5: Error in HFSQL engine**
An initialized browse is required by this operation. No browse was initialized on the specified item.

**6: Error in HFSQL engine**
The specified search item is not found.

**7: Error in HFSQL engine**
A started browse is required by this operation. No browse was started on the specified data file.

**8: Error in Native Access**
This operation is not supported by the Native Access.

**9: Error in HFSQL engine**
The specified transaction is invalid.

**10: Error in Native Access**
Unable to validate the specified transaction: the corresponding internal transaction has not ended.
The internal transaction must be ended.

**11: Error in HFSQL engine**
The identifier of the stored position is invalid.

**12: System error**
Insufficient memory. The memory allocation required by the operation was refused by the system.

**13: Operation failure**
Operation failure. This failure may be caused by an operation of another user. The current operation requires to re-read the current record in the database. The current record was not found. It has been modified or deleted from the database.

**14: Error in HFSQL engine**
The specified connection does not exist.

**15: System error**
Unable to read or open the specified file.

**16: Incompatible libraries**
The libraires used correspond to several incompatible versions. The HFSQL library is too old to be used by the Native Access. Reinstall the compatible libraries.

**17: WLanguage error**
Programming error caused by the features of Native Access. The structure of the data file does not support this operation. No suitable browse item found. .

**18: WLanguage error**
The operation cannot be performed: the specified record number does not match the current record number (0).
Specify 0 as record number.

**19: HFSQL error**
The specified file or table is not opened.

**20: Programming error**
Programming error or incompatible modification of the file structure. The description of the file in the database is not compatible with the description of the file in the analysis.
Several solutions can be implemented:

- Synchronize the analysis with the database and recompile the program.

- Modify the structure of the file in the database.

- Re-create the file with **HCreation** (the records found in the file will be lost). 




**21: Error returned by the database regarding the automatic identifier**
Failure caused by an error returned by the database. The message of this error is added to the following message: Failure defining the value of the automatic identifier for the specified file.

**22: Error returned by the database**
The details of this error are contained in the error message.

**23: Error in client library**
General protection fault in the client library used by Native Access.
Possible reason: The client layer is not compatible with the Native Access (version too old or too recent in relation to the Native Access).

**24: Positioning failure**
Failure to reposition on the specified record (with **HRestorePosition** for instance).
To avoid this error, add an automatic identifier into the file.

**26: Error in database**
The item specified as part of an index was not found in the list of table items.
Check the consistency between the table description and the index description in the database.

**27: Setup error**
The client library is not installed properly. Reinstall the client layer.

**29: Error caused by transactions in HFSQL engine**
Attempt to lock while no transaction is in progress. You must use **SQLTransaction** before **SQLLock**.

**30: Programming error**
The file is not found in the database. Use **HCreation** to create the file.

**31: Setup error**
The serial number of the Native Access is invalid. Re-install the native access.

**32: Error in SQL engine**
The query correction data transmitted to the Native Access by the SQL engine is not consistent.
To run this query, use hQueryWithoutCorrection.
This problem can also be caused by an alias of calculated item. If an alias of calculated item is named as an item of the source file, the name of the calculated item must be modified. 

**34: Error returned by the database**
Error while reindexing the file on the specified key.

**35: Programming error**
This operation is not supported by the Native Access for a query "without correction".
Don't specify hQueryWithoutCorrection or use another query to perform this operation.

**37: Setup error**
A function required by the Native Access was not found in the client library. The client library is not compatible with the Native Access.
Reinstall the client library.   

**38: Programming error**
Syntax error: the delimiter of the specified variable was not found.
You must fix the query.

**39: Programming error**
Syntax error: the name of the variable was not found.
You must fix the query.

**40: Programming error**
Syntax error: the specified input/output variable is not used in the query. The variable was probably misspelled in the query or when it was declared.
You must fix the query.

**41: Programming error**
The requested operation requires the addition or the completion of the WHERE clause. This is not possible: the query was run with hQueryWithoutCorrection.
If this query cannot be run without hQueryWithoutCorrection, start browsing the query result before performing this operation.  

**50: Error of HFSQL engine on the SQL functions**
The subscript of the specified column is greater than the number of columns found in the query result.

**51: Error of HFSQL engine on the SQL functions**
The subscript of the specified column is invalid.

### Error codes specific to the Native MySQL Access
<a name="error_codes_specific_the_native_mysql_access_ELTPARAGRAPHE000229"></a>

**100: Error while configuring the server**
The query exceeds the maximum length authorized on the server.
Increase the maximum length authorized on the server.

**101: Error in MySQL client library**
General protection fault in MySQL client library. The client library is not compatible with the Native Access.
Install a compatible client library (to do so, copy a compatible libmysql.dll library beside the WINDEV executable).
