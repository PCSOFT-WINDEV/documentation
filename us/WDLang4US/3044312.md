Adds an integrity rule between two data files on the server. This integrity rule has been previously described by a variable of type [Link description](../WDLang4/1514039.md). All the client applications must comply with these integrity rules.

**Remark**: You have the ability to describe inter-database integrity rules.  

The addition will be effective for the application that performed it once the connection has been closed and re-opened.

## Example


```wl
// Describe the connection
HDescribeConnection("MyConnection", "Julia", "Password", "MyHFServer", ...
	"MyDatabase", hAccessHFClientServer, hORead)
// Open the connection
HOpenConnection("MyConnection")
...
MyLink is Link Description
// Describe the "LIVES" link
MyLink.Name = "LIVES"
MyLink.SourceFile = ".\MyDatabase\city.fic"
MyLink.LinkedFile = ".\MyDatabase\customer.fic"
MyLink.SourceKey = "CITYNAME"
MyLink.LinkedKey = "CUSTCITY"
// Default link (0-1, 0-1)
HAddLink("MyConnection", MyLink)
```

## Syntax

`<Result> = HAddLink(<Source connection> [, <Linked connection>] , <Link>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the operation was performed, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if a problem occurs. [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) is used to identify the error.




**`<Source connection>: (Character string or Connection variable)`**

Connection to which belongs the source file of the link. This connection corresponds to: 

- the name of the connection defined in the data model editor or with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

- a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md).




**`<Linked connection>: (Optional character string or Connection variable)`**

Connection to which belongs the linked file of the link. This connection corresponds to: 

- the connection defined in the data model editor or with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

- a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md). 


If this parameter is not specified, both data files will belong to the same connection (&lt;Source connection&gt;).

**`<Link>: (Link Description variable)`**

Name of the [Link description](../WDLang4/1514039.md) variable containing the characteristics of the link to create.

<a name="NOTE0_1"></a>

## Remarks


### Link description
<a name="link_description_ELTPARAGRAPHE000125"></a>

In the link description, the names of the data files involved in the link ([SourceFile](../Proprietes/2512034.md) and [LinkedFile](../Proprietes/2512031.md) properties) must correspond to the physical names of the data files, relative to the Database used. The Database of each file is returned by &lt;Source connection&gt; and &lt;Linked connection>
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Miscellaneous
<a name="miscellaneous_ELTPARAGRAPHE000140"></a>

- [HDescribeLink](../WDLang4/3044191.md) is used to describe a temporary link on an ISAM database (not in Client/Server mode) or for the client application only (not on the server).

- [HDeleteLink](../WDLang4/3044314.md) is used to delete a link on the server.
