Positions on the first record of the data file whose value for a specific item is greater than or equal to a sought value (generic search by default).  ***The record is not read***. To read the record, use [HReadSeek](../WDLang4/3044050.md).  

The number of the current record is modified only when it is returned by [HRecNum](../WDLang4/3044063.md). For the functions that handle the current record number ([HDelete](../WDLang4/3044018.md), [HRead](../WDLang4/3044047.md), [HModify](../WDLang4/3044042.md), etc.), the value of this number is not updated: you must use [HRecNum](../WDLang4/3044063.md)(). For example: not to do: 

```wl
HDelete(Customer)
```
but 

```wl
HDelete(Customer, HRecNum())
```
Values in the browse item are read in ascending order (see Remarks for more details).

**Caution**: ***The record loaded in memory is not modified***. The HFSQL variables (Customer.Name for example, which means the *Name* item of *Customer* file) are not updated.

In most cases, **HSeek** sets the position in the data file to loop through the records that match a condition. [HNext](../WDLang4/3044027.md) is used to position on the next record corresponding to the condition.

Several cases may occur after the call to **HSeek**:

- a record corresponding to the condition was found: [HFound](../WDLang4/3044104.md) returns <u><u><u>True</u></u></u>

- the data file is empty or there is no record corresponding to the condition: [HOut](../WDLang4/3044094.md) returns <u><u><u>True</u></u></u>




**Remarks**: 

- By default, [HSeekFirst](../WDLang4/3044125.md) and [HSeekLast](../WDLang4/3044129.md) are used to perform an exact-match search.

- By default, **HSeek** performs a generic search.

## Example


```wl
// Generic search for the first record for which 
// the zip code starts with "75"
HSeek(Customer, ZC, "75")
```
<a name="Example2"></a>

```wl
// Exact-match search for the first record
// for which the Customer name is Moore
// Mode 7: Text item ending with Charact(0)
HSeek(Customer, Name, "Moore" + Charact(0))

// Mode 5.5: Text item filled by space characters
HSeek(Customer, Name, Complete("Moore", 30))

## Syntax

`<Result> = HSeek(<Data file> , <Key item> , <Sought value> [, <Options>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the position was set,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if an error occurred (lock, ...): the record is not read. This problem can be caused by:

	- a positioning problem (empty data file, etc.): [HFound](../WDLang4/3044104.md) returns <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> and [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) returns 0.

	- an error: [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) returns an integer other than 0. [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) returns more details.







**`<Data file>: (Character string)`**

Name of the HFSQL data file used.

**`<Key item>: (Character string)`**

Name of key item on which the search will be performed.

**`<Sought value>: (Type corresponding to the value)`**

Value of the sought item.

**`<Options>: (Optional constant (or combination of constants))`**

Configures:

- the lock mode applied to the sought record. 

- the type of iteration

- the type of search performed.

| *hIdentical* | Exact-match search (see the Notes). <br>A generic search is performed by default (parameter not specified). |
| *hKeepFilter* | The filter set by [HFilter](../WDLang4/3044100.md) will be taken into account, even if the search key is not optimized for the filter. Reminder: [HFilter](../WDLang4/3044100.md) returns the search key optimized for the filter.<br>Caution: in this case, performance issues may arise for large files.<br>![Hyper File 5.5](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HF55.png) This variable cannot be used. |
| *hLimitParsing* | The iteration will stop when the last searched value is found. The current record will correspond to the record found. In this case, [HFound](../WDLang4/3044104.md) returns <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> and [HOut](../WDLang4/3044094.md) returns <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>.<br>This constant is used to optimize the speed in Client/Server mode. |

| *hLockWrite* | Lock in write mode: the record currently read can be read by another application but it cannot be modified by another application. |

Use locking read functions (**HReadFirstLock**) kept for backward compatibility.

## Remarks


### Generic search/Exact-match search
<a name="generic_searchexactmatch_search_ELTPARAGRAPHE000276"></a>

A generic search or an exact-match search will be performed according to &lt;Sought value&gt;.

- **For a generic search**: performs a search on all the records that starts by the specified value
	To perform a generic search, the requested value must be specified in &lt;Sought value>.

- **For an exact-match search**: performs a search of all the records that exactly match the specified value.
	To perform an exact-match search, the size of the search argument must be exactly the same as the size of the key. The search argument must be filled with "space" characters for the text keys. To do so, use the [Complete](../WDLang1/3024010.md) function.



<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Space characters at the end of item
<a name="space_characters_the_end_item_ELTPARAGRAPHE000295"></a>

By default, when reading a record, the space characters found at the end of the text items are not deleted in the file variables.

In order for the space characters to be deleted, use [WithSpace](../WDLang4/3044142.md).
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Performing a search on a composite key
<a name="performing_search_composite_key_ELTPARAGRAPHE000309"></a>

Several methods can be used to perform a search on a composite key:

- Using a list of values

- Calling [HBuildKeyValue](../WDLang4/3044258.md)




**Using a list of values**
The following syntax is used to perform a search on a composite key:


```txt
HSeek(<File name>, <Name of composite key>, ...
	[<Search value of first element of composite key>, 
	<Search value of first element of composite key>, ...])
```
Example:

```wl
// Find the record
HSeek(Customer, LastName_FirstName, ["MOORE","Vince"])
```
![Hyper File 5.5](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HF55.png) To perform generic searches on a composite key, all the components of composite key must be Text components. Otherwise, an exact-match search is performed.
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Search on an array item
<a name="search_array_item_ELTPARAGRAPHE000339"></a>

The search is performed on the first array element (element with index 1). To perform a search on the other array elements, use the filters or queries.
<a name="NOTE0_5"></a>


### Search and filter
<a name="search_and_filter_ELTPARAGRAPHE000348"></a>

If a filter is enabled ([HFilter](../WDLang4/3044100.md)), this filter is taken into account during the search.
