Validates the current transaction:

- the modifications performed on the data file since the start of transaction ([HTransactionStart](../WDLang4/3044002.md) or [HTransaction](../WDLang4/1000023384.md)) are validated.

- the transaction file is deleted (if this transaction is the last transaction in progress for a network application).

- the records locked in read-only by the transaction are unlocked.

## Example


```wl
MyConnection1 is Connection

// Start transaction on data files associated with MyConnection1
HTransactionStart(MyConnection1)

// Code used to prepare the order to added
// ...

WHEN EXCEPTION IN
	// Add the order
	HAdd(Orders) 
	// Validate the addition
	HTransactionEnd(MyConnection1)
DO
	// Delete the order lines
	HTransactionCancel(MyConnection1)
END
```
<a name="Example2"></a>

```wl
// Start transaction on the Orders and OrdLine data files
HTransactionStart("C:\Temp\Transaction.trs", "Orders,OrdLine,-Customer")

// Code used to prepare the order to added
// ...

WHEN EXCEPTION IN
	// Add the order
	HAdd(Orders) 
	// Validate the addition
	HTransactionEnd() 
DO
	// Delete the order lines
	HTransactionCancel() 
END

## Syntax

### Validating a transaction in progress on a connection

`<Result> = HTransactionEnd(<Connection>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the transaction is ended,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if a problem occurs. [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) returns more details about the error. 




**Caution**: The function has no effect if a global transaction is started. The syntax 2 must be used.

**`<Connection>: (Character string or Connection variable)`**

Connection to use. This connection corresponds to: 

- the name of the connection defined in the data model editor or with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

- the name of a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md).


If this parameter corresponds to the *hAccessHF7* constant, the transaction will be performed on HFSQL ISAM files.

### Validating a global transaction in progress

`<Result> = HTransactionEnd()`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the transaction is ended,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if a problem occurs. [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) returns more details about the error.

## Remarks


### Error cases
<a name="error_cases_ELTPARAGRAPHE000144"></a>

- Nesting transactions: Transactions cannot be nested (i.e. [HTransactionStart](../WDLang4/3044002.md) or [HTransaction](../WDLang4/1000023384.md) cannot be called in a transaction). In this case, error 70031 occurs.

- A fatal error is displayed in the following cases: 

	- A transaction is started on all the connections while there is at least one connection in transaction. 

	- A transaction is started on a connection while a transaction was already started on all the connections. 

	- A transaction is started on all the connections while there is at least one connection whose isolation mode is not "Read Uncommitted".

### Handling records during a transaction
<a name="handling_records_during_transaction_ELTPARAGRAPHE000166"></a>

During a transaction, some rules must be complied with when handling the records. For more details, see [Transactions: Handling records during a transaction](../WDLang4/3044336.md).
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Transactions and independent HFSQL context
<a name="transactions_and_independent_hfsql_context_ELTPARAGRAPHE000178"></a>

When copying a context, if a transaction is in progress on the first context, the new context is not in transaction. You must call [HTransactionStart](../WDLang4/3044002.md) (or [HTransaction](../WDLang4/1000023384.md)) to start a transaction in the new context.

### OLE DB and Native Connectors
<a name="ole_and_native_connectors_ELTPARAGRAPHE000189"></a>

Only syntaxes with connection are taken into account by the Native Connectors (also called Native Accesses) that support transactions. You can also use [SQLTransaction](../WDLang4/3072029.md).
