The **hbCell** type is used to define the advanced characteristics of the content of a cell (item value) in an HBase table. The characteristics of this content can be defined and changed using different WLanguage properties. 
This type of variable is used by: 

- the [hbRead](../WDLang4/1000021706.md) function: the result of [hbRead](../WDLang4/1000021706.md) is an array of **hbCell**.

- variables of type [hbWriting](../WDLang4/1000021710.md), to specify the values to be written. 




**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).
