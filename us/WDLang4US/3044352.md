## Syntax

### Finding out the priority of the calling application

`<Result> = HPriority(<Connection>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**

Value of the priority for the application. This value is found between -10 (low priority) and 10 (high priority). 
By default, the priority is set to 0 when the application is started (standard priority). 

**`<Connection>: (Character string or Connection variable)`**

Connection to the HFSQL server. This connection corresponds to: 

- the name of the connection defined in the data model editor or with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

- the name of a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md).

---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**

Previous value of the priority for the application.

**`<Connection>: (Character string or Connection variable)`**

Connection to the HFSQL server. This connection corresponds to: 

- the name of the connection defined in the data model editor or with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

- the name of a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md). 




**`<Priority>: (Integer)`**

## Remarks


### Modification rights
<a name="modification_rights_ELTPARAGRAPHE000134"></a>

The rights to modify the priority are required to increase the priority of the current application. This right corresponds to the *hRightsPriority* constant (used in [HInfoServerRights](../WDLang4/3044322.md) and [HModifyServerRights](../WDLang4/3044328.md)).

The rights to modify the priority are not required to consult or reduce the priority of the current application.
