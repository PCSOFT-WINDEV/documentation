***In french: &lt;Source&gt;.ExécuteRequête***

<a name="XUse"></a>
<a name="Use"></a>
<a name="description"></a>
Declares a query to the HFSQL engine and runs this query. This query can correspond to: 

- a query created in the query editor. 

- an SQL Query variable. 


Then, the query result can be read. If a query with the same name already exists, this query is replaced. The result is recalculated.

**Caution**: To set the position on the first record of the query result, use [&lt;Source&gt;.ReadFirst](../WDLang4/1000025022.md), for example.

To free the resources of a query created in the query editor, use: 

- the [&lt;Source&gt;.CancelDeclaration](../WDLang4/1000024192.md) function.

- the [&lt;Source&gt;.FreeQuery](../WDLang4/1000025011.md) function.




**Remark**: A query will not be initialized if:

- the query name is already used in the current analysis (name of data file or name defined by one of the following functions: [&lt;Source&gt;.Declare](../WDLang4/1000024213.md), [&lt;Source&gt;.DeclareExternal](../WDLang4/1000024214.md), [&lt;Source&gt;.DescribeFile](../WDLang4/1000024215.md)).

- a syntax error is found in the query.


![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) You cannot execute queries with SQL code containing WLanguage functions.

## Example


```wl
// Initialize the "QRY_Customer_84" query
QRY_Customer_84.ExecuteQuery()
```
<a name="3044080_Example2"></a>

```wl
// Query on Oracle file: Customer uses the "MyConnection" connection
// QRY_MyQuery = "Select * from customers where CustomerID =?"
QRY_MyQuery.ExecuteQuery(hQueryDefault, 5)

## Syntax

### Executing a query (without connection)

`<Result> = <Source>.ExecuteQuery([<Mode> [, <Parameter 1> [, <Parameter N>]]])`
---

**`<Result>: (boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the query was initialized,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) returns more details about the problem.




**`<Source>: (Type corresponding to the source)`**

Name of query to be executed: 

- Logical name of the query to be initialized.
	If a query with the same name is already declared, it is replaced with the new query.

- Name of a variable of type [SQL query](../Motscles/1514082.md). 
	




**`<Mode>: (Optional Integer constant)`**

### Reading data during query initialization
<a name="reading_data_during_query_initialization_ELTPARAGRAPHE001084"></a>

Depending on the query (sorts, groups, etc.), the data can be read (or not) when initializing the query.

Remark: [ExecutionCompleted](../Proprietes/2512117.md) is used to find out whether the query is entirely filled (and therefore if the read operations can be performed without lock).

### Why should the hQueryWithoutCorrection constant be used
<a name="why_should_the_hquerywithoutcorrection_constant_used_ELTPARAGRAPHE001118"></a>

By default, WINDEV and WEBDEV interpret the SQL queries on OLE DB and on ODBC via the OLE DB provider. To prevent the query from being interpreted, use the *hQueryWithoutCorrection* constant.

The *hQueryWithoutCorrection* constant can be used if you directly enter the SQL code of your query in the query editor.

| hQueryWithoutCorrection is not specified | hQueryWithoutCorrection is specified |
| --- | --- |
| The connection associated with the data files in the query is defined automatically. | The connection to use must be specified in **HExecuteSQLQuery**. |
| All PC SOFT proprietary signs are replaced (e.g.: ']=' starts with) with their equivalent in standard SQL. | No replacement is performed. The standard SQL symbols must be used. |
| Dates and times adopt the format used by the database.<br>For example, the dates are in 'YYYYMMDD' format in WINDEV and WEBDEV while in Access, the dates are in #YYYYDDMM# or #YYYYMMDD# format depending on the system language. | No formatting is performed. The format recognized by the database must be used. |
| Floats are formatted (the decimal separator can be '.' or ',') | No formatting is performed for the floats. |
| Depending on the database used, the alias names are replaced with the full names of the items in Where, Order by and Group by<br>For example, the JET engine (Access, dBase, etc.) accepts no alias name in the Where clause of a query | No replacement is performed.

### Passing parameters to the query
<a name="passing_parameters_the_query_ELTPARAGRAPHE001162"></a>

Several methods can b e used to pass parameters to a query: 

1. Passing parameters with the following notation: &lt;Query name&gt;.&lt;Parameter name&gt; = &lt;Value&gt; (recommended)

2. Passing parameters in **HExecuteQuery** (kept for backward compatibility, compatible with PHP).




For more details on the different ways of passing parameters to a query, their advantages and disadvantages, see [Methods for passing parameters to a query](../Editeurs/2032050.md).

Let's present these two methods: 

1. **Passing parameters with the following notation: &lt;Query name&gt;.&lt;Parameter name&gt; = &lt;Value&gt; (recommended)**
	To pass parameters to a query with parameters before executing it, you can also use the following syntax:
	
	```txt
	<Query name>.<Name of parameter 1> = xxx
	<Query name>.<Name of parameter 2> = xxx
	<Query name>.<Name of parameter 3> = xxx
	<QueryName>.ExecuteQuery()
	IF ErrorOccurred = True THEN ...
	```

	**Remarks**:

	- This syntax makes it easier to pass parameters. Indeed, if the parameters are directly passed to **&lt;Source&gt;.ExecuteQuery**, the order of parameters must be complied with.

	- The structure of the query parameters is reset each time the query is executed.




2. **Passing parameters in HExecuteQuery (kept for backward compatibility)**
	In this case, the values of query parameters must be specified in their initialization order (visible in the query editor). Each parameter must correspond to the expected type. The different parameters are separated by a comma. The value of each parameter can be specified or not. 
	A parameter can be ignored by using the **Null** value. In this case, the selection conditions that uses this parameter will be ignored.
	
	**You can specify a list of values or a list of parameters.**
	If the selection condition for one of the query parameters is "is included in the list" or "is not included in the list", you must specify a list of values or parameters.
	To specify a list of values or a list of parameters, the different values or parameters must be separated by a semi-colon (';'), a carriage return ('CR') or a tabulation ('TAB').
	For example: 
	
	```wl
	QueryName.ExecuteQuery(hQueryDefault, "34000;34200;34400")
	```
or
	```wl
	QueryName.ExecuteQuery(hQueryDefault, "34000 "+ CR + "34200" + CR + "34400")
	```
or
	```wl
	QueryName.ExecuteQuery(hQueryDefault, "34000" + TAB + "34200" + TAB + "34400")
	```

	**Remark**: If one of the values or parameters contains a semi-colon, a carriage return or a tabulation, this value or parameter must be enclosed in quotes. For example:
	
	```wl
	QueryName.ExecuteQuery(hQueryDefault, "'A;A';'A;B';'A;C'")
	```

	Remark: All the query parameters do not necessarily have to be specified. The query conditions that use unspecified parameters will be ignored. 
	**Example**: Let's consider the query named "Customer_LastName_FirstName" whose SQL code is as follows:
	
	```sql
	SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER WHERE LASTNAME = {Param1} AND FIRSTNAME = {Param2}
	```


	- The 2 parameters are specified:
			
		```wl
		QRY_Customers_LastName_FirstName.ExecuteQuery(hQueryDefault, "Smith", "John")
		```
will execute the query
		```sql
		SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER WHERE LASTNAME = 'Smith' AND FIRSTNAME = 'John'
		```


	- Only the last name is specified: 
			
		```wl
		QRY_Customers_LastName_FirstName.ExecuteQuery(hQueryDefault, "Smith")
		```
will execute the query
		```sql
		SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER WHERE LASTNAME= 'Smith'
		```


	- Only the first name is specified: 
			
		```wl
		sLastName is Variant = Null 
		// Use the mandatory variant for the Null variable (not filled)
		
		QRY_Customers_LastName_FirstName.ExecuteQuery(hQueryDefault, sName, "John")
		
		or
		
		QRY_Customers_LastName_FirstName.ExecuteQuery(hQueryDefault, Null, "John")
		```
will execute the query
		```sql
		SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER WHERE FIRSTNAME= 'John'
		```

### **&lt;Source&gt;.ExecuteQuery** and access via JDBC
<a name="docparampagetitleshort_and_access_via_jdbc_ELTPARAGRAPHE001280"></a>

If the physical name of a data file used in the query differs from its logical name, in the SQL code, the name of items must be prefixed by the physical name of data file and not by its logical name. It is also possible not to prefix the names of items.
<a name="NOTE0_8"></a>


### Freeing the resources of the query
<a name="freeing_the_resources_the_query_ELTPARAGRAPHE001292"></a>

To free the resources of a query, use: 

- the [&lt;Source&gt;.CancelDeclaration](../WDLang4/1000024192.md) function.

- the [&lt;Source&gt;.FreeQuery](../WDLang4/1000025011.md) function.




If this operation is not performed, the query is still found in the current HFSQL context and it can be accessed from any process.

**Remarks**: 

- The query resources are not automatically released when the window that executed the query is closed (via **&lt;Source&gt;.ExecuteQuery**).

- The SQL Query variables are automatically freed at the end of variable scope. For more details, see [SQL queries in WLanguage](../Motscles/1514082.md).

### SQL queries (**&lt;Source&gt;.ExecuteQuery** or execution of SQL queries created in the query editor)
<a name="sql_queries_docparampagetitleshort_execution_sql_queries_created_the_query_editor_ELTPARAGRAPHE001398"></a>

- When using the SQL DELETE, INSERT or UPDATE statements in the SQL queries, no integrity check and no duplicate check are performed on an HFSQL database.

	- **To perform an automatic integrity check**, simply specify the *hCheckIntegrity* constant. This constant is used to enable the management of integrity during the query execution. The query is not run if an integrity error occurs. Indeed, a transaction is started, the records are locked in write mode during the execution of the query and they are unlocked at the end of its execution, regardless of the result (failure or success). If the application is stopped during the query execution (power outage for example), the transaction will be canceled when the data files of query are used for the next time.
			![HFSQL Client/Server](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HFCS.png) The integrity management is disabled if the *hCheckIntegrity* constant is not specified. However, an error occurs if an integrity management operation must be performed, but the user does not have the rights to disable integrity management ([&lt;Connection variable&gt;.ModifyDatabaseRights](../WDLang4/1000022707.md)).

	- **To perform an automatic check for duplicates**, simply specify the *hCheckDuplicates* constant. This constant is used to enable the management of duplicates during the query execution. The query is not run if a duplicate error occurs. Indeed, a transaction is started, the records are locked in write mode during the execution of the query and they are unlocked at the end of its execution, regardless of the result (failure or success). If the application is stopped during the query execution (power outage for example), the transaction will be canceled when the data files of query are used for the next time.
			Note: If a duplicate error is detected during the execution of an UPDATE query, **&lt;Source&gt;.ExecuteQuery** returns <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> and the process continues. The corresponding error is returned by [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md).
			**Remark**: The default automatic assistance is not called for the duplicate errors. A simple duplicate error is generated. If an assistance was redefined by [&lt;Source&gt;.OnError](../WDLang4/1000025073.md), then this custom assistance is called.
			![HFSQL Client/Server](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HFCS.png) The management of duplicates is disabled if the *hCheckDuplicates* constant is not specified. An error occurs if a duplicate management operation must be performed, but the user has no rights to disable the management of duplicates ([&lt;Connection variable&gt;.ModifyDatabaseRights](../WDLang4/1000022707.md)).




- The UPDATE, DELETE and INSERT queries only exist during their execution. No WLanguage function can be used on this type of query after its execution.

- No cascading deletion is supported by the DELETE queries.

- **When running an INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE query on HFSQL data files**, the number of added, modified or deleted records is returned by the [H.NbRecModificationQuery](../WDLang4/3087002.md) variable.
