The **hScheduledTask** type is used to manage a scheduled HFSQL Client/Server task through programming. The characteristics of this schedule task can be defined and changed by several [WLanguage properties](#NOTE0_1).

**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

## Example


```wl
MyTask is hScheduledTask
MyTask.Description = "Scheduled backup"
MyTask.Month = "*"
MyTask.DayOfWeek = "*"
MyTask.DayOfMonth = "*"
MyTime is Time
MyTime = EDT_Time
MyTask.Hour = MyTime.Hour
MyTask.Minute = MyTime.Minute
MyTask.NumberExecution = 1
MyTask.Procedure = "HBackup"
Add(MyTask.Parameter, NameCSDatabase + "/LOG_TASKSFIC")
Add(MyTask.Parameter, NameCSDatabase + ".ScheduledBackup")
Add(MyTask.Parameter, True)
Add(MyTask.Parameter, MyTask.Description)
nID is int = HAddTask(CSConnection, MyTask)

### Properties specific to the description of hScheduledTask variables
<a name="properties_specific_the_description_hscheduledtask_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000039"></a>

The following properties can be used to handle a **hScheduledTask** variable:

| Property name | Type used | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AtStart | Integer constant | Indicates whether the task must be done when starting the HFSQL server as well as its execution mode: <br><br>- *hBlocking*: The task is locking. The HFSQL server will not be accessible during the task execution. <br><br>- *hBackgroundTask*: The task is not locking. The HFSQL server will be accessible during the task execution. The task is run in background task. <br><br>- *No*: The task must not be run when starting the server (default value). <br><br><br> |
| DayOfMonth | Character string | Number of the day for which the scheduled task must be run ("31" for example). This number is included between 0 and 31.<br>This parameter can also correspond to:<br><br>- a list of numbers separated by commas: used to specify several months.<br><br>- an interval. For example, "9-13" (the task is scheduled from the 9th to the 13th of the month).<br><br>- a star ("\*") to specify the entire range.<br><br>- an interval with a step, "\*/2" for example to perform the task on every even day of the month.<br><br><br> |
| DayOfMonthOrDayOfWeek | Boolean | Managed the execution of a scheduled task by specifying the day number of the week or day number of the month. Example: execution every Monday 1st day of month.<br>This property can correspond to:<br><br>- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> to run the scheduled task every Monday AND the first day of the month (cumulated conditions).<br><br>- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> to run the task on Monday 1st (exclusive conditions).<br><br><br> |
| DayOfWeek | Character string | Number of the day for which the scheduled task must be run ("2" for example). This number is included between 1 and 7 (1 = Monday, 2 = Tuesday, ...). <br>This parameter can also correspond to:<br><br>- a list of numbers separated by commas: used to specify several days.<br><br>- an interval. For example, "1-3" (the task is scheduled for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday).<br><br>- a star ("\*") to specify the entire range.<br><br>- an interval with a step, "\*/2" for example to perform the task on every even day of the week.<br><br>- the day of the week in letters ("monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday").<br><br><br> |
| Description (\*) | Character string | Description associated with the scheduled task. The description of scheduled task corresponds to an empty string by default.<br>This property is optional. |
| Enabled | Boolean | <br><br>- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the task scheduling is enabled,<br><br>- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise.<br><br><br> |
| Hour | Character string | <br><br>Execution time of scheduled task. If **TimeUTC** is set to <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>, this time will be in UTC.The possible values are:<br><br>- a digit included between 0 and 23.<br><br>- a list of numbers separated by commas: used to specify several hours.<br><br>- an interval. For example, "9-13".<br><br>- a star ("\*") to specify the entire range.<br><br>- an interval with a step, "\*/2" for example to perform the task at every even hour.<br><br><br> |
| Minute | Character string | <br><br>Minutes of the execution time of the scheduled task. If **TimeUTC** is set to <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>, this time will be in UTC.<br><br>The possible values are:<br><br>- a digit included between 0 and 59.<br><br>- a list of numbers separated by commas: used to specify several minutes.<br><br>- an interval. For example, "9-13".<br><br>- a star ("\*") to specify the entire range.<br><br>- an interval with a step, "\*/2" for example to perform the task at every even minute.<br><br><br> |
| Month | Character string | Number of the execution month of scheduled task ("11" for example). The possible values are:<br><br>- a digit included between 1 and 12.<br><br>- a list of numbers separated by commas: used to specify several months.<br><br>- an interval. For example, "9-11".<br><br>- a star ("\*") to specify the entire range.<br><br>- an interval with a step, "\*/2" for example to perform the task on every even month.<br><br><br> |
| NumberExecution | Integer | Number of times the task must be run. This property can also correspond to the *Infinite* constant. |
| Parameter | Array | Parameters of the stored procedure that will be run by the scheduled task. For more details, see ["How to handle the parameters passed to the stored procedure?"](#NOTE0_2). |
| Procedure | Character string | Name of the stored procedure that will be run by the scheduled task. <br>This property has the following format: &lt;Database Name&gt;:&lt;Name of Set of Procedures&gt;.&lt;Name of Stored Procedure&gt;. <br>To perform a backup, this property must correspond to "HBackup". |
| TimeUTC | Boolean | <br><br>- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> (default value) if the time is in UTC (**Hour** and **Minute** properties),<br><br>- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise.<br><br><br> |
| User | Character string | User who created the scheduled task.<br>This property is read-only. |

The properties followed by a star (\*) are optional.

### How to handle the parameters passed to the stored procedure 
<a name="how_handle_the_parameters_passed_the_stored_procedure_ELTPARAGRAPHE000243"></a>

The **Parameter** property of the **hScheduledTask** variable is an array of strings.

To define the parameters of a stored procedure when triggering a scheduled task, use [Add](../WDLang1/1000017348.md) or [ArrayAdd](../WDLang1/3075003.md). Example:


```wl
Add(MyTask.Parameter, gsNameCSDatabase + ".ScheduledBackup")
```
To handle the parameters, the FOR EACH syntax allows you to browse an array.

To find out the number of array elements, you can use:

- The [ArrayCount](../WDLang1/3075012.md) function

- The [Count](../WDLang1/3025009.md) property

### Functions that use hScheduledTask variables
<a name="functions_that_use_hscheduledtask_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000272"></a>

| Function name | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| [HAddTask](../WDLang4/1000017091.md) | Adds a scheduled task on the server defined by the connection. This task was defined by an advanced variable of **hScheduledTask** type. |
| [HInfoTask](../WDLang4/1000017409.md) | Returns the characteristics of a scheduled task in an advanced variable of **hScheduledTask** type. |
| [HModifyTask](../WDLang4/1000017374.md) | Modifies a scheduled task on the server defined by the connection. This task is found in an advanced variable of **hScheduledTask** type. |


<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Compatibility
<a name="compatibility_ELTPARAGRAPHE000297"></a>

The **hScheduledTask** type replaces the [global hScheduledTask structure](../WDLang4/1000017180.md) available in version 12. This structure is kept for backward compatibility.
