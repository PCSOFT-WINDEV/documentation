The **HCS.FrameSize** variable is used to resize the outgoing data frame. In some cases, resizing the frames can be used to adapt the stream of outgoing and incoming data to the performance of the hardware used. 

For example, if the connection between the client computers and the HFSQL Client/Server engine goes through setup networks (network card, switch, router, vpn, ...) with non-standard setting, frames are lost if they exceed a given size. In this case, you have the ability to use this variable.  

**In most cases, if the hardware is recent and properly configured, there is no need to resize the frames.**
