## Example

ScreenToFile(Customer)
HSave(Customer)
```

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = HSave([<Data file> [, <Options>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the addition or the modification was performed,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if an error occurred.




**`<Data file>: (Optional character string)`**

Name of the data file, view or query used. If this name is not specified, **HSave** will use the last data file used by the last HFSQL function (function starting with "H").

**`<Options>: (Optional integer constant)`**

Used to configure:

- the effect of addition or modification on the current iteration.

- the mode for calculating the automatic identifier. For more details, see [Managing the automatic identifier during an addition](../WDLang4/3044183.md).

- the lock mode of the added or modified record.

- the management of duplicates.

- the management of integrity.

| --- | --- |
| *hAffectBrowse* | **Effect of the adidtion/modification on the iteration**: The addition or the modification affects the iteration. <br>For example, [HReadNext](../WDLang4/3044037.md) used after **HSave** positions on the record found after the added/modified record.<br>The *hAffectBrowse* constant has priority over the *hWriteDefault* constant. |
| *hCheckDuplicates* | **Management mode of duplicates**: Checks for duplicates for this operation, even if the duplicate check is disabled ([HSetDuplicates](../WDLang4/3044057.md)).<br>A WLanguage error occurs if the *hIgnoreDuplicates* and *hCheckDuplicates* constants are used at the same time.<br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Access by JDBC: This constant is not available. |
| *hCheckIntegrity* | **Management mode of integrity**: Checks the integrity of operation even if the automatic integrity check is disabled ([HSetIntegrity](../WDLang4/3044058.md)).<br>A WLanguage error occurs if the *hIgnoreIntegrity* and *hCheckIntegrity* constants are used at the same time.<br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Access by JDBC: This constant is not available. |
| *hForceIDAuto* | **Mode for calculating the automatic identifier**: The automatic identifier is not calculated during the addition. The identifier corresponds to:<br><br>- the value assigned to the item through programming (CUSTOMERID = 7 for example)<br><br>- the default identifier value specified in the data model editor (if the data file was just opened, with no record read)<br><br>- the identifier value found in memory (identifier value for the last record read in the data file).<br><br><br>Once the record is added, the next automatic identifier calculated by the HFSQL engine will be calculated while ignoring the value added by *hForceIDAuto*.<br>A WLanguage error occurs if the *hSetIDAuto* and *hForceIDAuto* constants are used at the same time. |
| *hIgnoreDuplicates* | **Management mode of duplicates**: Does not check for duplicates for this action, even if the automatic duplicate check is enabled ([HSetDuplicates](../WDLang4/3044057.md)).<br>A WLanguage error occurs if the *hIgnoreDuplicates* and *hCheckDuplicates* constants are used at the same time.<br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Access by JDBC: This constant is not available. |
| *hIgnoreIntegrity* | **Management mode of integrity**: Ignores the integrity check for this add operation, even if the automatic integrity check is enabled ([HSetIntegrity](../WDLang4/3044058.md)).<br>A WLanguage error occurs if the *hIgnoreIntegrity* and *hCheckIntegrity* constants are used at the same time.<br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Access by JDBC: This constant is not available. |
| *hLockNo* <br>(default value) | **Mode for locking the added or modified record**: No lock: the added or modified record will not be locked.<br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Access by JDBC: This constant is not available. |
| *hLockReadWrite* | **Mode for locking the added or modified record**: Lock in read/write: the added or modified record will be locked in read/write. This record cannot be read or modified by another application. Only the current application can modify it, read it or unlock it.<br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Access by JDBC: This constant is not available. |
| *hLockWrite* | **Mode for locking the added or modified record**: Lock in write mode: the added or modified record will be locked in write mode. This record can be read by another application but it cannot be modified by another application. Only the current application can modify it or unlock it.<br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Access by JDBC: This constant is not available. |
| *hRecalculateIDAuto* | **Mode for calculating the automatic identifier**: The automatic record identifier will be recalculated during the write operation. This constant has priority over *hForceIDAuto* and *hSetIDAuto*.<br> |
| *hSetIDAuto* | **Mode for calculating the automatic identifier**: The automatic identifier is not calculated during the addition: the identifier value will be the one stored during the addition. <br><u><u><u><u>The next identifier value calculated by the HFSQL engine will correspond to the greatest identifier value in the file +1. </u></u></u></u><br>A WLanguage error occurs if the *hSetIDAuto* and *hForceIDAuto* constants are used at the same time. |
| *hWriteDefault*<br>(default value) | **Effect of the adidtion or modification on the iteration**: The addition or the modification does not affect the current iteration. <br>For example, [HReadNext](../WDLang4/3044037.md) used after **HSave** positions on the record found after the current record before the addition or modification.<br>The *hAffectBrowse* constant has priority over the *hWriteDefault* constant. |

## Remarks


- If the [NewRecord](../Proprietes/1000017090.md) property is set to <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>, **HSave** adds the record to the data file ([HAdd](../WDLang4/3044147.md)). For more details, see the documentation about [HAdd](../WDLang4/3044147.md). 

- If [NewRecord](../Proprietes/1000017090.md) is set to <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>, **HSave** modifies the record in the data file ([HModify](../WDLang4/3044042.md)). For more details, see the documentation about [HModify](../WDLang4/3044042.md).
