## Example


```wl
// Open a replication in direct mode
ReplicOpen("MyReplication")
```


<a name="Example2"></a>



```wl
// Opens a replication on the replication server
ReplicOpen("MyReplication", "", "ReplicationServer", "Flora", "password")

// Initialize the replication by passing the zip code 
// to take into account
IF ReplicInfo("MyReplication", replicInitialized) = False THEN
	ReplicInitialize("MyReplication", 47012)
END

// Starts the synchronization
ReplicSynchronize("MyReplication")

// Process errors returned by Replication functions
CASE Error:
	Error(ErrorInfo(errFullDetails))
	RETURN

## Syntax

### Opening a replication in direct mode

`<Result> = ReplicOpen(<Replication> [, <Working directory>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the replication was opened,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if an error occurred. For more details about the problem, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md).




**`<Replication>: (Character string)`**

Name of replication file to open (file with a ".wer" extension), with no path and no extension. This file was created by the replication editor (ReplicEdit). This file must be found beside the executable.

**`<Working directory>: (Optional character string)`**

Directory where the replication will be performed (creation of files required by the replication). By default (or if this parameter corresponds to an empty string ("")): 
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) this directory corresponds to the directory of the application executable (directory returned by [fExeDir](../WDLang1/3036049.md)).

### Opening a replication with a replication server

`<Result> = ReplicOpen(<Replication> , <Working directory> , <Server address> , <User> , <Password>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the connection was established with the replication server,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if an error occurred. For more details about the problem, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md).




**`<Replication>: (Character string)`**

Name of replication to open. This name corresponds to the publication name of replication.

**`<Working directory>: (Character string)`**

Directory where the replication will be performed (creation of files required by the replication). By default (or if this parameter corresponds to an empty string ("")): 
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) this directory corresponds to the directory of the application executable (directory returned by [fExeDir](../WDLang1/3036049.md)).

**`<Server address>: (Character string)`**

Address of the replication server. This address can correspond to:

- the IP address of server in xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx format

- the name of server.




**`<User>: (Character string)`**

User name. This name corresponds to an account created on the replication server.

**`<Password>: (Character string)`**

Password associated with the user.

## Remarks


### Use in direct mode
<a name="use_direct_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000136"></a>

The call to this function is optional in direct mode because it is automatically called by the other replication functions (with the default parameters) if it was not called beforehand.


### Opening ports
<a name="opening_ports_ELTPARAGRAPHE000141"></a>

This function is using the replication server that is using the Web server on which it is installed. Therefore, port 80 must be opened on the replication server.
