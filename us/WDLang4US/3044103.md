Returns the status of a record during a modification conflict.

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) This function must be used only when a modification conflict is not automatically managed (in a procedure or window called to process the modification conflict ([HOnError](../WDLang4/3044017.md))). [HOnError](../WDLang4/3044017.md) is not available when using stored procedures.

// Displays the status of the item for the file record
Trace(HErrorStatusModification(FileName, hRecFile))
// Displays the status of the item for the user record
Trace(HErrorStatusModification(FileName, hRecUser))

## Remarks


### Modification conflict and status of the record
<a name="modification_conflict_and_status_the_record_ELTPARAGRAPHE000120"></a>

When using an application in network, conflicts may occur because of conflicting data entered by the different users. For example:

**1.** The user X edits the form for the "California" state.

**2.** The user Y edits the form for the "California" state.

**3.** The user X renames the state to "California_01".

**4.** The user Y modifies the name of the state and saves it. A modification conflict occurs during this backup.

A conflict of modification status occurs when the form is deleted by the user X for example.

The different cases are presented in the table below:


|   |   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Record read | Addition | Crossed | Deleted |
| Record on disk |
| Addition | Modification conflict | Modification conflict | Modification conflict |
| Crossed | Modification status conflict | Modification conflict | Modification conflict |
| Deleted | Modification status conflict | Modification status conflict | XXXX |
