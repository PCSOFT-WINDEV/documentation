<a name="Use"></a>
<a name="description"></a>
Moves several records forward from the current position in the data file, according to a specified item.

The destination record is read and loaded in memory: HFSQL variables are updated (e.g. Customer.Name, i.e. item *Name* of data file *Customer*).

Several cases may occur after the call to **HForward**:

- no other record exists in the data file: [HOut](../WDLang4/3044094.md) returns <u><u><u>True</u></u></u>. No read operation is performed.

- the function tries to lock a record that is already locked in read-only: [HErrorLock](../WDLang4/3044099.md) returns <u><u><u>True</u></u></u> and [HOut](../WDLang4/3044094.md) returns <u><u><u>True</u></u></u>.
	
	![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Access by JDBC: The management of locks is not available for databases accessed by JDBC. 
	




This function can be used with the HFSQL files, views or queries.

## Syntax

`<Result> = HForward([<Data file>] [, <Item> [, <Step> [, <Options>]]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the move was performed in the file,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if an error occurred (lock, end of file, etc.): the record is not read. [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) is used to identify the error.




**`<Data file>: (Optional character string)`**

Name of the data file, view or query used. 
If this name is not specified, **HForward** will use the last data file used by the last HFSQL function (function starting with "H").



**`<Item>: (Optional character string)`**

Name of item according to which the browse is performed. 
If this name is not specified, **HForward** handles the last item in the data file used by the last HFSQL function (function starting with "H").

**`<Step>: (Optional integer)`**

Number of steps forward (which means number of records to browse). By default, &lt;Step&gt; = 1.


**`<Options>: (Optional Integer constant (or combination of constants))`**

Configures:

- the lock mode applied to the record read. By default, the lock performed corresponds to the current lock.
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hLockNo* | No lock: the record can be read or modified by another application during the reading. |
| *hLockReadWrite* | Lock in read/write: the record currently read cannot be read or modified by another application. |
| *hLockWrite* | Lock in write mode: the record currently read can be read by another application but it cannot be modified by another application. |


	![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) The lock options will have no effect if the locks are not supported by the OLE DB provider or by the Native Connector.
	![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Access by JDBC: The management of locks is not available for databases accessed by JDBC. 
	

- the management of duplicates during the browse. By default, all the duplicates are browsed.
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hDistinct* | When a browse is performed on a key item, a single record is browsed if duplicates are found. |




![Hyper File 5.5](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HF55.png) &lt;Options&gt; is ignored.

## Remarks


### Read operation according to a key item or not
<a name="read_operation_according_key_item_not_ELTPARAGRAPHE000218"></a>

In all cases, the browse operation must have been initialized by one of the following functions: [HReadFirst](../WDLang4/3044051.md), [HFirst](../WDLang4/3044113.md), [HReadSeekFirst](../WDLang4/3044036.md), [HSeekFirst](../WDLang4/3044125.md), [HChangeKey](../WDLang4/3044151.md), [HRestorePosition](../WDLang4/3044137.md).

If the item used is a key item:

- if the *hDistinct* constant is not specified, **HForward** moves forward &lt;Step&gt; key values from the current position.

- if the *hDistinct* constant is specified, **HForward** moves forward &lt;Step&gt; key values from the current position. If duplicates are found, a single duplicate is read.




If the item used is not a key item:

- the *hDistinct* constant is not available.

- **HForward** moves foward from &lt;Step&gt; active records from the current position.



<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Memos
<a name="memos_ELTPARAGRAPHE000261"></a>

The memos associated with the record can be automatically read (or not) when reading the record. [HSetMemo](../WDLang4/3044139.md) is used to customize this automatic read operation.

If the memos are supported, the associated text memos are read when the record is read. The binary memos are read only when they are explicitly used ([HExtractMemo](../WDLang4/3044072.md)).
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Lock
<a name="lock_ELTPARAGRAPHE000278"></a>

By default (no lock variable specified), the lock performed corresponds to the current lock mode.

If a lock is specified (*hLockWrite* or *hLockReadWrite* constant), the record will be read and locked only if it is not already locked by another application.

![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) The lock options will have no effect if the locks are not supported by the OLE DB provider or by the Native Connector.


<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Miscellaneous
<a name="miscellaneous_ELTPARAGRAPHE000297"></a>

- The result of [HFound](../WDLang4/3044104.md) must be ignored ([HFound](../WDLang4/3044104.md) must be used for the searches performed by [HReadSeek](../WDLang4/3044050.md)).

- The current record number is returned by [HRecNum](../WDLang4/3044063.md).

- **HForward** respects the current active filter (defined by [HFilter](../WDLang4/3044100.md)).

- [HChangeKey](../WDLang4/3044151.md) is used to modify the search key while remaining positioned on the current record.

- **HForward**(Customer,Name) is equivalent to [HReadNext](../WDLang4/3044037.md)(Customer,Name)
