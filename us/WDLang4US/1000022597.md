The **mongoWriteConcern** type is used to define the level of acknowledgment of receipt requested for the write operations in a stand-alone mongod, in a set of replicas or in fragmented clusters. The characteristics of these options can be defined and changed using different WLanguage properties. 

**Remarks**: 

- This type of variable is used by the [mongoCollection](../WDLang4/1000022411.md) variables. 

- For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

<a name="properties_specific_the_description_mongowriteconcern_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000046"></a>

The following properties can be used to handle the options for writing into a Mongo collection:

| Property name | Type used | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Log | Boolean | <br><br>- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> to write a trace of the write operation into the log.<br><br>- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise.<br><br><br> |
| Mode | Integer constant | Minimum number of nodes that must have acknowledged the process to consider that the writing is performed. The following values are available: <br><br>- *mwcDefault*: A single node must have acknowledged the process to consider that the writing is performed. <br><br>- *mwcMajority*: Most of the nodes must have acknowledged the process to consider that the writing is performed. <br><br>- *mwcTag*: The number of nodes is the one defined in a pre-configuration defined on the server. In this case, **.Tag** must be specified. <br><br>- *mwcUnacknowledged*: No node must have acknowledged the process to consider that the writing is performed. Caution, no error is returned in this case. <br><br>- Minimum number of nodes that must have acknowledged the process (strictly positive integer).<br><br><br> |
| Tag | Character string | Name of server pre-configuration. |
| Timeout | Integer ou Duration | <br><br>- Maximum timeout to perform a writing. The write operations are considered as failed after this timeout. <br><br>- 0 for no write timeout.<br><br><br><br><br>This property can correspond to: <br><br>- an integer corresponding to the number of seconds,<br><br>- a Duration variable,<br><br>- the duration in a readable format (e.g., 1 s or 10 ms). <br><br><br> |
