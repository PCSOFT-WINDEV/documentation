## What is a trigger?
<a name="what_trigger_ELTTEXTE000275"></a>


### Definition
<a name="definition_ELTPARAGRAPHE000011"></a>

A trigger is a WLanguage procedure automatically called by the HFSQL engine whenever a modification is performed (addition, deletion, modification, ...) on a record of a data file.

A trigger is used to associate a WLanguage process with one or more HFSQL functions ([HAdd](../WDLang4/3044147.md), [HModify](../WDLang4/3044042.md), [HDelete](../WDLang4/3044018.md), ...) without having to worry about the location of these functions in the source code. The triggers associated with the HFSQL functions used are run even if it is a window or a code created by a wizard.

Remark: The triggers also operate with the functions for managing Table controls based on a data file: [TableAdd](../WDLang1/3074017.md), [TableAddLine](../WDLang1/3074006.md), [TableModify](../WDLang1/3074019.md), [TableModifyLine](../WDLang1/3074028.md), [TableDelete](../WDLang1/3074032.md), ...

Using a trigger allows you to:

- Reduce the code size. For example, using a trigger allows you to group the processes associated with one or more HFSQL functions (check for duplicates, consistency of data, ...).

- Make the code easier to read.

- Simplify the future evolutions of the application.




The triggers can be applied to all types of data files:

- HFSQL

- Native accesses (Oracle, AS/400, ...)

- ODBC

- OLE DB




Remarks: 

- With an HFSQL Client/Server database, you also have the ability to define server triggers. For more details, see [Server triggers](../WDLang4/3044369.md). 

- When data files are modified via a query, server triggers, simple triggers or client triggers are fired.

## Available types of triggers
<a name="available_types_triggers_ELTTEXTE000305"></a>
Two types of triggers are available:

- The "BEFORE" triggers:
	A "BEFORE" trigger is called: 

	- *before* running an HFSQL function ([HAdd](../WDLang4/3044147.md), [HModify](../WDLang4/3044042.md), [HDelete](../WDLang4/3044018.md), ...). 

	- *before* running a function for managing the Table controls based on a data file.
			A "BEFORE" trigger can be used for example to check the consistency of data for the items of a record. With this type of trigger, an HFSQL variable can be initialized in order to cancel the execution of the associated HFSQL function.




- The "AFTER"  triggers:
	An "AFTER" trigger is called: 

	- *after* running an HFSQL function (except if the program was interrupted during the execution of this function). 

	- *after* running a function for managing the Table controls based on a data file. 
			An "AFTER" trigger can be used to manage the process of errors for example.

### The WLanguage functions
<a name="the_wlanguage_functions_ELTPARAGRAPHE000112"></a>Several WLanguage functions are used to handle the triggers:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [HActivateTrigger](../WDLang4/3044155.md) | Re-enables a trigger that was disabled by [HDeactivateTrigger](../WDLang4/3044089.md). |
| [HDeactivateTrigger](../WDLang4/3044089.md) | Disables a trigger. |
| [HDeleteTrigger](../WDLang4/3044090.md) | Deletes a trigger. |
| [HDescribeTrigger](../WDLang4/3044074.md) | Adds or modifies a trigger on an HFSQL data file. |
| [HListTrigger](../WDLang4/3044231.md) | Returns the list of triggers applied to one or more HFSQL data files. |
| [HSetTrigger](../WDLang4/3044065.md) | Enables or disables the management of triggers. |
| [HTriggerRecordBefore](../WDLang4/1000025873.md) | Retrieves the value of the current record before the trigger(s) are executed. |

### Creating a trigger
<a name="creating_trigger_ELTPARAGRAPHE000120"></a>

To create a "BEFORE" trigger or an "AFTER" trigger, use [HDescribeTrigger](../WDLang4/3044074.md) in the initialization process of the project. The trigger can be created:

- On one or more analysis files, 

- For one or more HFSQL functions ([HAdd](../WDLang4/3044147.md), [HModify](../WDLang4/3044042.md), [HDelete](../WDLang4/3044018.md), [TableAdd](../WDLang1/3074017.md), [TableAddLine](../WDLang1/3074006.md), ...).




The associated WLanguage procedure is run whenever a trigger is run.

**Remark**: A trigger is global to the project.

### Creating a procedure run by a trigger
<a name="creating_procedure_run_trigger_ELTPARAGRAPHE000152"></a>

A trigger procedure accepts no parameter. However, some HFSQL state variables are positioned before each call:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *H.FileName* | Character string: Logical name of the file whose trigger is enabled. |
| *H.Action* | Character initialized to "A" for a Before trigger and to "P" for an After trigger. |
| *H.TriggerFunction* | Character string: Name of HFSQL function that activated the trigger. |
| *H.ToDo* | During the execution of a before trigger:<br><br>- cancel the execution of the HFSQL function by assigning **"A"** to the HFSQL state variable: H.ToDo = "A". <br>	In this case, the action is not performed and the function (HAdd, HModify, etc.) returns <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> (no error).<br><br>- cancel the execution of the current HFSQL function by assigning **"E"** to the HFSQL state variable: H.ToDo = "E". <br>	In this case, the action is not performed and the function (HAdd, HModify, etc.) returns <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>. The error message is as follows: "The action on XXX file was interrupted by the trigger".<br><br><br> |


**Remark**: When a "BEFORE" trigger and an "AFTER" trigger are associated with an HFSQL function, if "BEFORE" cancels the execution of the HFSQL function (by setting H.ToDo to "A"), "AFTER" is not executed.

In the procedure code, the [MyFile](../Motscles/1511019.md) keyword gets  and handles the name of the file on which the trigger was fired. For an "AFTER" trigger, if the HFSQL command was not run properly, the procedure associated with the trigger is not run.

### Automated tests and triggers
<a name="automated_tests_and_triggers_ELTPARAGRAPHE000199"></a>

If the automated tests activate triggers that use dialog boxes ([YesNo](../WDLang1/3021005.md), [Confirm](../WDLang1/3021007.md), ...), these dialog boxes must be disabled when the test is run by [InAutomaticTestMode](../WDLang1/3014027.md). 
<a name="NOTE3_5"></a>


### Triggers and data file aliases
<a name="triggers_and_data_file_aliases_ELTPARAGRAPHE000215"></a>

Triggers can be defined on data file aliases. 

- The alias must have been described before calling [HDescribeTrigger](../WDLang4/3044074.md).

- The alias name must be specified in [HDescribeTrigger](../WDLang4/3044074.md).
