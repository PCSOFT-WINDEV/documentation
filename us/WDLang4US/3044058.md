<a name="Use"></a>
<a name="description"></a>
Enables or disables the management of an integrity constraint on a file link.

**Remark**: By default, all integrity rules defined in the analysis description are enabled.


<a name="Example1"></a>
<a name="sample_code"></a>

## Example


```wl
// Disable the check for cardinalities on the link between an order and a customer
HSetIntegrity(CustomerOrder, hCardinality, False)
```
<a name="Example2"></a>

```wl
// Disable all integrity rules on all application data files
HSetIntegrity("*", "*", hCardinality + hOnUpdate + hOnDelete, False)
// equivalent to: HSetIntegrity(False)
```
<a name="Example3"></a>

```wl
// Disable integrity rules on the link between an order and a customer
// with use of a connection
CtSourceFile is Connection
CtLinkedFile is Connection

HSetIntegrity(CtSourceFile, CtLinkedFile, CustomerOrder, ... 
	hCardinality + hOnUpdate + hOnDelete, False)
```

## Syntax

### Enabling or disabling the management of an integrity constraint by specifying the file name

`<Result> = HSetIntegrity([<Link to use>] [, <Data file>] [, <Integrity constraint>] , <Management mode>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**

Former management mode of integrity (before the call to **HSetIntegrity**): 

- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the management of integrity was enabled,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if the management of integrity was disabled. 


If &lt;Link to use&gt; = "\*" or if &lt;Data file&gt; = "\*", &lt;Result&gt; is set to <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the integrity was enabled for at least one link or for at least one data file in the former management mode of the integrity.

**`<Link to use>: (Optional character string)`**

Name of relevant link (name made of the different data files involved in the link). 
If this name is not specified or if it is equal to "\*", the new integrity management is applied to all links defined in the analysis.

**`<Data file>: (Optional character string)`**

Name of the data file used. 
If this parameter is not specified or of it is equal to "\*", the new management is applied to all the data files involved in the link (including the aliases).
If &lt;Link to use&gt; corresponds to "\*", this parameter must also correspond to "\*". Indeed, you cannot enable or disable all the integrity constraints for all links found in a specific data file.

**`<Integrity constraint>: (Optional Integer constant (or combination of constants))`**

Used to define the integrity constraints that must be managed. If this parameter is not specified, the new management mode is applied to all link constraints.


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hCardinality* | Check the link cardinalities. |
| *hOnDelete* | Integrity rule applied during a deletion. |
| *hOnUpdate* | Integrity rule applied during a modification. |



**`<Management mode>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the integrity constraint is enabled,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if this management must be disabled. If only this parameter is specified, the management mode is applied to all data files.

### Enabling or disabling the management of an integrity constraint by specifying the connection of data file

`<Result> = HSetIntegrity(<Source data file connection> [, <Linked data file connection>] , <Link description> [, <Integrity constraint>] , <Management mode>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**

Former management mode of integrity (before the call to **HSetIntegrity**): 

- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the management of integrity was enabled,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if the management of integrity was disabled.




**`<Source data file connection>: (Character string or Connection variable)`**

Connection to which the link source data file belongs. This connection corresponds to: 

- the name of the connection defined in the data model editor or with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

- the name of a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md).




**`<Linked data file connection>: (Optional character string or Connection variable)`**

Connection to which the linked data file of the link belongs. This connection corresponds to: 

- the name of the connection defined in the data model editor or with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

- the name of a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md).


If this parameter is not specified, both data files will belong to the same connection (&lt;Source data file connection&gt;).

**`<Link description>: (Link Description variable)`**

Name of the [Link description](../WDLang4/1514039.md) variable that contains the characteristics of the link.

**`<Integrity constraint>: (Optional Integer constant (or combination of constants))`**

Integrity constraints that must be managed. If this parameter is not specified, the new management mode is applied to all link constraints.


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hCardinality* | Check the link cardinalities. |
| *hOnDelete* | Integrity rule applied during a deletion. |
| *hOnUpdate* | Integrity rule applied during a modification. |



**`<Management mode>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the integrity constraint is enabled,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if this management must be disabled. If only this parameter is specified, the management mode is applied to all data files.

## Remarks


### Enabling the management of integrity
<a name="enabling_the_management_integrity_ELTPARAGRAPHE000248"></a>

If an operation performed on a data file triggers a violation of an integrity constraint on an active rule, the operation is not performed and provokes the error of the function. In this case, [HErrorIntegrity](../WDLang4/3044086.md) returns <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>.

**Remark**: Only [HAdd](../WDLang4/3044147.md), [HModify](../WDLang4/3044042.md), [HDelete](../WDLang4/3044018.md), [HCross](../WDLang4/3044121.md) and [HWrite](../WDLang4/3044092.md) can generate an integrity error.

### Disabling the integrity rules
<a name="disabling_the_integrity_rules_ELTPARAGRAPHE000281"></a>

Disabling an integrity rule means the possibility not to comply with the constraints specified during the description of the data files in the data model editor. Therefore, disabling an integrity rule should be done with great care: it must be used advisedly.

### In HFSQL Client/Server mode
<a name="hfsql_clientserver_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000292"></a>

Using the **HSetIntegrity**(&lt;Management&gt;) syntax affects the behavior of all HFSQL servers (no matter whether the connection is opened before or after the call to **HSetIntegrity**).

Using **HSetIntegrity** by specifying the link name can be done if:

- The link is described in the client analysis (or by [HDescribeLink](../WDLang4/3044191.md)).

- The two data files linked by this link are found on the same HFSQL server.




If **HSetIntegrity** is called before the data files are in Client/Server mode (if [HChangeConnection](../WDLang4/3044150.md) is used for example), the server enables the integrity rule.

Rights are associated with the management of integrity on the database: *hRightsManageIntegrity*. An error occurs when the user tries not to comply with the integrity constraint (when using [HAdd](../WDLang4/3044147.md), [HModify](../WDLang4/3044042.md), ...).
