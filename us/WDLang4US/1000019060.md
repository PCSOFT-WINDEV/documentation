## Example


```wl
sList is string 
sName is string
nStatus is int

sList = HClusterNodeInfo("clustermanager.mydomain.com", "secret")
FOR EACH STRING sNode OF sList SEPARATED BY CR
	sName = ExtractString(sNode, 1)
	nStatus = ExtractString(sNode, 2)
	
	SWITCH nStatus 
		CASE 0
			Trace("The status of the node " + sName + ...
				" is unknown.")
		CASE 1
			Trace("The node " + sName + ...
				" is stopped.")
		CASE 2
			Trace("The node " + sName + ...
				" is ready to be started.")
		CASE 3
			Trace("The node " + sName + ...
				" is being started.")
		CASE 4
			Trace("The node " + sName + ...
				" is waiting for a source of synchronization.")
		CASE 5
			Trace("The node " + sName + ...
				" is being synchronized.")
		CASE 6
			Trace("The node " + sName + ...
				" is enabled.")
		CASE 7
			Trace("The node " + sName + ...
				" is being stopped.")
		CASE 8
			Trace("The node " + sName + ...
				" could not be defined.")
		OTHER CASE
			Trace("The node " + sName + ...
				" has an unknown status (" + nStatus + ")")
	END
END

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = HClusterNodeInfo(<Coordinator> , <Password>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Character string)`**

Status of the cluster nodes. The result string has the following format: 

```txt
<Name of Node 1> + TAB + <Status of Node 1> + CR +
<Name of Node 2> + TAB + <Status of Node 2> + CR +
...
<Name of Node N> + TAB + <Status of Node N>
```


In this string, &lt;Status of Node&gt; corresponds to one of the following values: 

| Value | Node status |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | The status of the node is unknown. |
| 1 | The node is stopped. |
| 2 | The node is ready to be started. |
| 3 | The node is being started. |
| 4 | The node is waiting for a source of synchronization. |
| 5 | The node is currently synchronized. |
| 6 | The node is enabled. |
| 7 | The node is being stopped. |
| 8 | The status of the node cannot be defined. |



**`<Coordinator>: (Character string)`**

DNS name of computer where the cluster coordinator is installed.

**`<Password>: (Character string)`**

Password used to connect to the coordinator. This password was given when [installing the cluster](../WDLang4/1000019031.md).
