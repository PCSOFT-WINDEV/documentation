<a name="Use"></a>
<a name="description"></a>
Sets the position on the last record of a data file according to a browse item. The record is read and the HFSQL variables are updated (e. g. Customer.Name, in other words, the *Name* item in the *Customer* data file).

The highest value in the browse item is read (for more details, see [remarks](#NOTE0_1)).

In most cases, **HReadLast** is used to set the position in the data file in order to perform a read loop with [HReadPrevious](../WDLang4/3044048.md).

Several cases may occur after the call to **HReadLast**:

- the data file is empty or no record corresponds to the filter (defined by [HFilter](../WDLang4/3044100.md)): no reading is performed and [HOut](../WDLang4/3044094.md) returns <u><u><u>True</u></u></u>.

- the function tries to lock a record that is already locked in read-only: no read operation is performed, [HErrorLock](../WDLang4/3044099.md) returns <u><u><u>True</u></u></u> and [HOut](../WDLang4/3044094.md) returns <u><u><u>True</u></u></u>.
	
	![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Access by JDBC: The management of locks is not available for databases accessed by JDBC.




This function can be used with the data files, HFSQL views or queries.

## Syntax

`<Result> = HReadLast([<Data file> [, <Browse item>] [, <Options>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**

Corresponds to: 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if an error occurred. In this case, [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) returns an integer other than 0. [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) returns more details about the error. The record is not read. 

- the value of [HFound](../WDLang4/3044104.md) in the other cases (the record can be read, even if &lt;Result&gt; returns <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>). 




**`<Data file>: (Optional character string)`**

Name of data file, HFSQL view or query used. 
If this parameter is an empty string (""), **HReadLast** manipulates the last data file used by the last HFSQL function (function starting with "H").

**`<Browse item>: (Optional character string)`**

Name of item used to loop through the data file or the view. If this name is not specified, **HReadLast** will use:

- For a data file: the last browse item used on this file by the last function for HFSQL management (starting with the letter H). If this item does not exist, the best browse item is automatically used. 

- For a query: the ORDER BY of the query (if it exists), otherwise the last item used. 

- For a view: the sort item of the view (if it exists), otherwise the last item used.




**`<Options>: (Optional constant (or combination of constants))`**

Configures:

- the lock set on the record read by **HReadLast**.

- whether the filter that was defined must be taken into account.

| *hForwardOnly* | ![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) Constant that can only be used with Native Connectors (also called Native Accesses).<br><br>Optimizes simple iterations that do not use the following features:<br><br>- Reading the previous record.<br><br>- Modifying a record.<br><br>- Saving position.<br><br><br>If one of these features is used, the result may differ from the expected one.<br><br>For example, this constant can be used when looping through records to populate a Table control programmatically. |
| *hKeepFilter* | The filter set by [HFilter](../WDLang4/3044100.md) will be taken into account, even if the search key is not optimized for the filter.

| *hNoRefresh* | ![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) **HReadLast** does not refresh the content of the table or query. If possible, the query is not re-run. All the saved positions are stored. |

![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) The lock options will have no effect if the locks are not supported by the OLE DB provider or by the Native Connector.![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png) The lock mode specified by **HReadLast** will remain effective during the calls to [HReadPrevious](../WDLang4/3044048.md) and [HReadNext](../WDLang4/3044037.md).

To modify the lock mode, you must use:

- [HReadSeekFirst](../WDLang4/3044036.md) or [HReadSeekLast](../WDLang4/3044034.md),

- [HReadFirst](../WDLang4/3044051.md) or **HReadLast**.

- [HLockRecNum](../WDLang4/3044152.md) or [HUnlockRecNum](../WDLang4/3044194.md).


![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) For Native Oracle Connector, a different lock mode can be specified for each record. However, if a transaction was started by [SQLTransaction](../WDLang4/3072029.md) before setting the lock, the lock will only be released at the end of the transaction ([SQLTransaction](../WDLang4/3072029.md) with the *sqlCommit* or *sqlRollBack* constant).![Hyper File 5.5](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HF55.png) The lock options are ignored. Use locking read functions (**HReadLastLock**) kept for backward compatibility.![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Access by JDBC: The management of locks is not available for databases accessed by JDBC.

## Remarks


### Read operation according to a key item or not
<a name="read_operation_according_key_item_not_ELTPARAGRAPHE000315"></a>

If the item is a key, **HReadLast** reads the record with the greatest key value. The sort order is the one that was specified in the analysis for this key. If duplicates are found, **HReadLast** reads the last "duplicate" record according to the sequence of record numbers.


If the item is not a key, **HReadLast** reads the last active record. When browsing the data file, the records will be sorted according to their record number. 
In this case, the selected browse item will appear in red in the code editor and a warning will be displayed in the ["Code" pane](../Editeurs/2027009.md).

**Remark**: The [automatic completion](../Editeurs/2013001.md) proposes the key items only.

### Locks
<a name="locks_ELTPARAGRAPHE000345"></a>

By default (&lt;Options&gt; not specified), the record is not locked.

If a lock is requested (*hLockWrite* or *hLockReadWrite* constant), the record will be read only if this record is not already locked.

![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) The lock options will have no effect if the locks are not supported by the OLE DB provider or by the Native Connector.
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Memos
<a name="memos_ELTPARAGRAPHE000360"></a>

The memos associated with the record can be automatically read (or not) when reading the record. [HSetMemo](../WDLang4/3044139.md) is used to customize this automatic read operation.

If the memos are supported, the associated text memos are read when the record is read. The binary memos are read only when they are explicitly used ([HExtractMemo](../WDLang4/3044072.md)).

### Password
<a name="password_ELTPARAGRAPHE000379"></a>

If **HReadLast** is the first function that handles the specified data file, the password is checked when the opening data file. If the password is incorrect, [HErrorPassword](../WDLang4/3044082.md) returns <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> and [HOut](../WDLang4/3044094.md) is set to <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>.
<a name="NOTE0_5"></a>


### Miscellaneous
<a name="miscellaneous_ELTPARAGRAPHE000404"></a>

- The current record number is returned by [HRecNum](../WDLang4/3044063.md).

- [HChangeKey](../WDLang4/3044151.md) is used to modify the search key while remaining positioned on the current record.

- To optimize the first iterations on a data file, use [HOptimize](../WDLang4/3044005.md) on this data file.

- This function replaces **HReadLastLock** and **HReadLastNoLock**, which were kept for compatibility with WINDEV 5.5.
