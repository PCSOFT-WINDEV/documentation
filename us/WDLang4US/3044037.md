<a name="description"></a>
Sets the position on the next data file record according to a browse item. The record is read and the HFSQL variables are updated (Customer.Name for example, which means the *Name* item of *Customer* file).

Values in the browse item are read in ascending order (see [remarks](#NOTE0_1) for more details).

**HReadNext** is used to position in the data file during a browse loop. This function can only be run: 

- after a function that starts a browse ([3044051](../WDLang4/3044051.md) or [3044125](../WDLang4/3044125.md) for example),

- after a call to [3044151](../WDLang4/3044151.md).




Several cases may occur after the call to **HReadNext**:


- the file is empty or no record corresponds to the filter (defined by [HFilter](../WDLang4/3044100.md)): no reading is performed and [HOut](../WDLang4/3044094.md) returns <u><u><u>True</u></u></u>.

- the function tries to lock a record that is already locked in read-only: no read operation is performed, [HErrorLock](../WDLang4/3044099.md) returns <u><u><u>True</u></u></u> and [HOut](../WDLang4/3044094.md) returns <u><u><u>True</u></u></u>.

This function can be used with the data files, HFSQL views or queries.

## Syntax

`<Result> = HReadNext([<Data file> [, <Browse item>] [, <Options>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**

Corresponds to: 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if an error occurred. In this case, [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) returns an integer other than 0. [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) returns more details about the error. The record is not read. 

- the value of [HFound](../WDLang4/3044104.md) in the other cases (the record can be read, even if &lt;Result&gt; returns <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>). 




**`<Data file>: (Optional character string)`**

Name of the data file, view or query used. If this parameter is an empty string (""), **HReadNext** manipulates the last data file used by the last HFSQL function (function starting with "H").

**`<Browse item>: (Optional character string)`**

Name of item used to loop through the data file, view or query. If this name is not specified, **HReadNext** will use:

- *For a data file*: the last browse item used on this data file by the last HFSQL management function (function starting with "H"). If this item does not exist, the best browse item is automatically used. 

- *For a query*: the ORDER BY of query if it exists, otherwise the last item used. 

- *For a view*: the sort item of the view (if it exists), otherwise the last item used.




**`<Options>: (Optional constant (or combination of constants))`**

Used to configure:

- the lock set on the record read by **HReadNext**

- the management of duplicates. By default, all the duplicates are browsed.





|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hDistinct* | If duplicates are found, this constant allows you to read a single record among the duplicates. This parameter is taken into account only if the browse is performed on a key item.<br><br>![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) This constant is ignored. |
| *hLockNo* | No lock: the record can be read or modified by another application during the reading. |
| *hLockReadWrite* | Lock in read/write: the record currently read cannot be read or modified by another application. |
| *hLockWrite* | Lock in write mode: the record currently read can be read by another application but it cannot be modified by another application. |

![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Access by JDBC: This parameter is ignored.![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) Lock options will have no effect if the OLE DB provider or Native Connector (also called Native Access) does not support locks.![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png) The lock options specified by **HReadNext** will be ignored. The lock mode specified by [HReadFirst](../WDLang4/3044051.md) or [HReadLast](../WDLang4/3044140.md) will remain effective during the calls to **HReadNext** and [HReadPrevious](../WDLang4/3044048.md).

To modify the lock mode, you must use:

- [HReadSeekFirst](../WDLang4/3044036.md) or [HReadSeekLast](../WDLang4/3044034.md),

- [HReadFirst](../WDLang4/3044051.md) or [HReadLast](../WDLang4/3044140.md).

- [HLockRecNum](../WDLang4/3044152.md) or [HUnlockRecNum](../WDLang4/3044194.md).
	![Hyper File 5.5](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HF55.png) The lock options are ignored. Use locking read functions (**HReadNextLock**) kept for backward compatibility.

## Remarks


### Read operation according to a key item or not
<a name="read_operation_according_key_item_not_ELTPARAGRAPHE000261"></a>

If the item is a key, **HReadNext** reads the record with the greatest key value. The sort order is the one that was specified in the analysis for this key. 

**Remark**: In a search loop ([HReadSeekFirst](../WDLang4/3044036.md)  for example), when **HReadNext** reads the record with the greatest key value, [HFound](../WDLang4/3044104.md) allows you to find out whether the record corresponds (or not) to the sort criterion.

If the item is not a key, **HReadNext** reads the next active record. When browsing the data file, the records will be sorted according to their record number. 
In this case, the selected browse item will appear in red in the code editor and a warning will be displayed in the ["Code" pane](../Editeurs/2027009.md).

**Remark**: The [automatic completion](../Editeurs/2013001.md) proposes the key items only.
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Memos
<a name="memos_ELTPARAGRAPHE000296"></a>

The memos associated with the record can be automatically read (or not) when reading the record. [HSetMemo](../WDLang4/3044139.md) is used to customize this automatic read operation.

If the memos are supported, the associated text memos are read when the record is read. The binary memos are read only when they are explicitly used ([HExtractMemo](../WDLang4/3044072.md)).
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Looping through records that match a condition
<a name="looping_through_records_that_match_condition_ELTPARAGRAPHE000313"></a>

In most cases, [HReadSeek](../WDLang4/3044050.md), [HReadSeekFirst](../WDLang4/3044036.md) and [HReadSeekLast](../WDLang4/3044034.md) are used to position in the data file to perform a browse loop among the records corresponding to a condition. **HReadNext** and [HReadPrevious](../WDLang4/3044048.md) are used to read the next or previous record corresponding to the condition:

- if the item used is a key, **HReadNext** will read the next records corresponding to the values greater than or equal to the sought value.

- if the item used is not a key, **HReadNext** will read the next records corresponding to the values equal to the sought value.




To ignore the search while going to the next or previous record, use one of the following functions:

- [HCancelSeek](../WDLang4/3044157.md)

- [HReadLast](../WDLang4/3044140.md)

- [HReadFirst](../WDLang4/3044051.md)




**Caution**: if a browse must be performed by **HReadNext**, the initial search ([HReadSeek](../WDLang4/3044050.md), [HReadSeekFirst](../WDLang4/3044036.md), [HReadSeekLast](../WDLang4/3044034.md)) must not use the **hLimitParsing** constant.
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Modifying the value of search key
<a name="modifying_the_value_search_key_ELTPARAGRAPHE000365"></a>

If the value of the browse item is modified before **HReadNext** is used, the current record can be read again by **HReadNext** in the rest of the browse.

Modifying the browse item updates the file index key. This modification is taken into account when reading the next records. 

This remark is also valid when using **HReadNext** without search key a sorted query (ORDER BY).

### Locks
<a name="locks_ELTPARAGRAPHE000386"></a>

By default (&lt;Options&gt; not specified), the record is not locked.

If a lock is specified (*hLockWrite* or *hLockReadWrite* constants), the record will be read only if this record is not already locked.

![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) The lock options will have no effect if the locks are not supported by the OLE DB provider or by the Native Connector.
<a name="NOTE0_6"></a>


### Miscellaneous
<a name="miscellaneous_ELTPARAGRAPHE000401"></a>

- The current record number is returned by [HRecNum](../WDLang4/3044063.md).

- [HChangeKey](../WDLang4/3044151.md) is used to modify the search key while remaining positioned on the current record.

- To optimize the first iterations on a data file, use [HOptimize](../WDLang4/3044005.md) on this data file.
