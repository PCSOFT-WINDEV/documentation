Changes the mode and the method for locking data files.

![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) **Caution**: The lock options will have no effect if the locks are not supported by the OLE DB provider or by the Native Connector.

![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Access by JDBC: This function has no effect and it always returns the *hModeMulti* constant.

## Example


```wl
// Change the mode of all data files
HMode("*", hModeMulti)

// Make the "Customer" data file inaccessible to other applications
HMode(Customer, hModeMono)
```

## Syntax

### Modifying the lock mode

`<Result> = HMode([<Data file>, ] <Mode>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer constant)`**

Lock mode performed on the data file before modification.


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hModeMono* | Single-user mode: the data files are entirely locked in read/write as soon as they are opened. This mode prevents the other applications from accessing the data files already opened by the current application. |
| *hModeMulti* | Multi-user mode: the data files are not locked when they are opened. The other applications can access the data files. |


![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) The result always corresponds to *hModeMulti*.![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Access by JDBC: The result always corresponds to *hModeMulti*.

**`<Data file>: (Optional character string)`**

Name of the data file used. If this parameter corresponds to "\*" or if it is not specified, the modifications will be applied to all the data files.

**`<Mode>: (Integer constant)`**

Lock mode that must be performed on the data file. 
If only this parameter is specified, the management mode is applied to all data files.


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hModeMono*<br>(default value) | **Single-user mode**: the data files are entirely locked in read/write as soon as they are opened. This mode prevents the other applications from accessing the data files already opened by the current application. |
| *hModeMulti* | **Multi-user mode**: the data files are not locked when they are opened. The other applications can access the data files. |


![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) The mode used is *hModeMulti*.

### Modifying the lock mode and the lock method (advanced use)

`<Result> = HMode([<Data file>, ] <Mode> [, <Method>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer constant)`**

Lock mode performed on the data file before modification.


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hModeMono* | **Single-user mode**: the data files are entirely locked in read/write as soon as they are opened. This mode prevents the other applications from accessing the data files already opened by the current application. |
| *hModeMulti* | **Multi-user mode**: the data files are not locked when they are opened. The other applications can access the data files. |


![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) The result always corresponds to *hModeMulti*.![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Access by JDBC: The result always corresponds to *hModeMulti*.

**`<Data file>: (Optional character string)`**

Name of the data file used. If this parameter corresponds to "\*" or if it is not specified, the modifications will be applied to all the data files.

**`<Mode>: (Integer constant)`**

Lock mode that must be performed on the data file. 
If only this parameter is specified, the management mode is applied to all data files.


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hModeMono*<br>(default value) | **Single-user mode**: the data files are entirely locked in read/write as soon as they are opened. This mode prevents the other applications from accessing the data files already opened by the current application. |
| *hModeMulti* | **Multi-user mode**: the data files are not locked when they are opened. The other applications can access the data files. |


![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) The mode used is *hModeMulti*.

**`<Method>: (Optional integer constant)`**

Method for implementing the locks:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hModeDirect*<br>(default value) | The implementation of locks has priority (over the modification for example). <br>Therefore, a record on which several read operations are performed will not be modified but the locks are faster. |
| *hModeReservation* | Implementation of non-priority locks (advanced use)<br>This method allows you to immediately modify a record on which several read operations are performed. This method is slower than the *hModeDirect* method.<br>This constant is useful when an important number of locking read operations are successively performed on the same record. |


![HFSQL Client/Server](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HFCS.png) This parameter is ignored.

## Remarks


### Lock mode
<a name="lock_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000209"></a>

By default, if the current project:

- is associated with an analysis, the lock mode performed on the data files is the multi-user mode (the data files are not locked when they are opened, the other applications can access the data files).

- is not associated with an analysis, the lock mode performed on the data files is the single-user mode: the data files are entirely locked in read/write as soon as they are opened. This mode prevents the other applications from accessing the data files already opened by the current application.




To modify the lock mode used:

1. Open the project description window: on the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, click "Description". 

2. Display the "Files" tab.

3. Specify the lock mode that must be used ("Management mode of files").



<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Changing the mode
<a name="changing_the_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000239"></a>

Changing the mode cancels all the current locks applied to the data file. 
There is no need to close the data file to change mode.
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Changing the method
<a name="changing_the_method_ELTPARAGRAPHE000250"></a>

Changing the method has no effect on the current locks applied to the data file. 
There is no need to close the data file to change method.
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Changing the mode and the method
<a name="changing_the_mode_and_the_method_ELTPARAGRAPHE000261"></a>

The change of mode and method is directly performed on the physical data file. Therefore, this change is applied to the data file and to all its aliases.
