The **hScheduledOptimization** type is used to programmatically manage a scheduled optimization task on an HFSQL server. A scheduled optimization task periodically performs statistical calculations or reindexes the data files on the HFSQL server.

The characteristics of this scheduled optimization task can be defined and modified by several WLanguage properties.

**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see ["Declaring a variable"](../Motscles/1514032.md).

## Example


```wl
// Recalculate the statistics for the files found in "MyDatabase" every Saturday at 23:00
Optim is hScheduledOptimization
Optim.Description = "Recalculating the statistics for the files found in the MyDatabase database"

Optim.Scheduling.Month = "*"
Optim.Scheduling.DayOfWeek = "Saturday"
Optim.Scheduling.Hour = "23"
Optim.Scheduling.Minute = "0"

Optim.File[1].Name = "MyDatabase"
Optim.File[1].Option = hOptStat

HAddScheduledOptimization(MyConnection, Optim)
```

### Properties specific to hScheduledOptimization variables
<a name="properties_specific_hscheduledoptimization_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000040"></a>

The following properties can be used to handle a **hScheduledOptimization** variable:

| **Property name** | **Type used** | **Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Description | Character string | Text describing the scheduling of the optimization.<br>The description of the optimization scheduling corresponds to an empty string ("") by default. |
| Enabled | Boolean | <br><br>- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the scheduling of the optimization is enabled, <br><br>- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise.<br><br><br> |
| File | Array of [hFileParameter](../WDLang4/1000018900.md) variables | Description of the files that must be taken into account during the optimization. |
| Identifier | Integer | Identifier of the optimization task. <br>**This property is read-only**. |
| NumberExecution | Integer | Number of times the task for optimization scheduling must be run. This property can also correspond to the *Infinite* constant. |
| Scheduling | [hScheduling](../WDLang4/1000018853.md) variable | Characteristics of the scheduling. |
| User | Character string | User who created the task for optimization scheduling. <br>This property is read-only. |

<a name="functions_that_handle_the_hscheduledoptimization_type_ELTPARAGRAPHE000114"></a>The following functions can be used to handle a **hScheduledOptimization** variable:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |

| [HListScheduledOptimization](../WDLang4/1000018863.md) | Lists the scheduled optimization tasks of HFSQL Client/Server data files for a connection. |
| [HModifyScheduledOptimization](../WDLang4/1000018931.md) | Modifies a scheduled optimization task on the HFSQL server defined by the connection. |
