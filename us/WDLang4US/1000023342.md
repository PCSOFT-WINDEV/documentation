## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = MemcachedAssign(<Connection> , <Key> , <Value> [, <Expiration> [, <Additional value>]])`

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the operation was performed, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if an error occurred. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) with the *errMessage* constant.




**`<Connection>: (memcachedConnection variable)`**

Name of the [memcachedConnection](../WDLang4/1000023339.md) variable that corresponds to the connection to Memcached.  

**`<Key>: (Character string)`**

Key to store. 

**`<Value>: (Character string or Buffer)`**

Value to store. 

**`<Expiration>: (Integer or optional duration)`**

Duration during which the key is stored in the cache. This duration is expressed in seconds. This duration can correspond to: 

- an integer corresponding to the number of seconds,

- a Duration variable. 

- the direct indication of duration ('10s' for example). 


This duration is set to 0 by default. In this case, the duration is unlimited: if there is not enough memory, the oldest keys are deleted. 

**`<Additional value>: (Optional integer)`**

Used to store an additional value associated with the Key/Value couple. This parameter can be used to describe the key or the value for example.
