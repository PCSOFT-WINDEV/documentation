## Example


```wl
// Describe the connection
MyConnection is Connection

TheRights is string
ARight is string
// Retrieves the read/add rights granted to the usernamed Moore 
// on MyDatabase
TheRights = MyConnection.InfoDatabaseRights("Smith", ...
		hRightsRead + hRightsInsert, "MyDatabase")
ARight = ExtractString(TheRights, firstRank, TAB)
WHILE ARight <> EOT
	SWITCH ARight
		CASE hAllowed
		...
		CASE hForbidden
		...
		CASE hInherit
		... 
	END    
	ARight = ExtractString(TheRights, NextRank, TAB)
END

## Syntax

`<Result> = <Connection>.InfoDatabaseRights(<User/Group> , <Rights> , <Database> [, <Result display mode>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Character string)`**



- Requested information, 

- Empty string ("") if an error occurred. 

- "Unknown user" or "Unknown group" if the current user has no permissions to see other users (*hRightsSeeUser* constant) and wants to get information about another user or group.




The requested information depend according to the parameter &lt;Display mode of result&gt;: 

- **In hDefault mode**, &lt;Result&gt; is a list of values separated by tabs. 
	
	```txt
	<Value of rights 1> + TAB + ... + TAB + <Value of rights N>
	```

	where &lt;Value of rights&gt; corresponds to the value of the rights requested by the &lt;Rights&gt; parameter. The values in the list can correspond to one of the following constants:

| --- | --- |
| *hAllowed* | The relevant rights are granted to the user or group. |
| *hForbidden* | The relevant rights are not granted to the user or group. |
| *hInherit* | The user belongs to at least one group to which the relevant rights were granted.<br>This constant is returned only if the display mode is not set to *hEffective*. |



- **In hDetails mode**, &lt;Result&gt; is a list of values with the following format: 
	
	```txt
	<Relevant rights 1> + TAB + <Value of rights 1> + CR + ...
	<Relevant rights N> + TAB + <Value of rights N> + CR
	```

	where: 

	- &lt;Relevant rights&gt; corresponds to one of the constants used in the &lt;Rights&gt; parameter. 

	- &lt;Value of rights&gt; corresponds to one of the constants: 
			


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hAllowed* | The relevant rights are granted to the user or group. |
| *hForbidden* | The relevant rights are not granted to the user or group. |
| *hInherit* | The user belongs to at least one group to which the relevant rights were granted.<br>This constant is returned only if the display mode is not set to *hEffective*. |




**`<Connection>: (Connection variable)`**

Name of the [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md) variable that describes the connection for which the rights of a user or group of users must be known.

**`<User/Group>: (Character string)`**

Name of the user or group whose rights must be known.

**`<Rights>: (Integer constant (or combination of constants))`**
