Modifies the physical name of a data file. 

**Reminder**: By default, the physical file is created with the name that was given to it in the analysis.

## Syntax

`<Result> = HChangeName(<Data file> , <Physical name>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the operation was performed, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if a problem occurs. [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) is used to identify the error.




**`<Data file>: (Character string)`**

Name of the data file (defined in the analysis). This name is used by all the functions for handling the HFSQL data files.

**`<Physical name>: (Character string)`**

New physical name of the data file.

- If this parameter is an empty string (""), the physical name used will correspond to the physical name defined in the analysis.

- This parameter must contain no drive name and no directory name. 

- This name will be stored when closing the data file. 

- The [PhysicalName](../Proprietes/2512059.md) property is used to find out the physical name given to the data file by **HChangeName**.


![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) Depending to the database used, the physical name of the data file can be prefixed by the name of the database, the name of the user, or the name of the schema. In this case: 

- the full physical name is specified in the data file description in the data model editor ("Name of the table in the external database"). 

- **HChangeName** can also be used to change the physical name of the data file. See [Use with the Native Connectors and/or the OLE DB provider](#NOTE0_3).

<a name="NOTE0_1"></a>

## Remarks


### Use conditions
<a name="use_conditions_ELTPARAGRAPHE000122"></a>

- The data file must be closed in order for this modification to be taken into account (use [HClose](../WDLang4/3044073.md) if necessary), otherwise the modification will be taken into account during the next opening.

- ![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) **XML**: **HChangeName** changes the name of the XML TAG associated with the data file described in the analysis (does not change the physical name). To change the name of the file, you must use a connection ([HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) by specifying the name of the XML file as data source) and associate this connection with the file via [HChangeConnection](../WDLang4/3044150.md).





### Multiple changes of name
<a name="multiple_changes_name_ELTPARAGRAPHE000143"></a>

**HChangeName** can be called several times with different parameters. When the physical name is redefined several times for the same logical name, the last physical name that was given replaces all the other ones.
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Changing the drive or the directory
<a name="changing_the_drive_the_directory_ELTPARAGRAPHE000154"></a>

**HChangeName** can only be used to change the name of the physical file. To modify its location, use [HChangeDir](../WDLang4/3044168.md) and [HSubstDir](../WDLang4/3044028.md).
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![User code (UMC)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/MCU.png)![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) 

### HChangeName function: Use with the Native Connectors and/or the OLE DB provider
<a name="docparampagetitleshort_function_use_with_the_native_connectors_andor_the_ole_provider_ELTPARAGRAPHE000173"></a>

By default, the logical name passed to **HChangeName** is considered as the only name in the table. It is encapsulated by using the encapsulation characters corresponding to the database or specified by the OLE DB provider before being sent to the database (this is used to manage the table names containing special characters).

To provide a file name composed of &lt;Username&gt;.&lt;Table name&gt; (or depending on the database, &lt;Schema name&gt;.&lt;Table name&gt;) in **HChangeName**, these names must be already formatted (using encapsulation characters corresponding to the database, or specified by the OLE DB provider).

Example for SQLServer:
The encapsulation characters are " ".
To rename CUSTOMER as DBO.CUSTOMER using **HChangeName**, you must pass "DBO"."CUSTOMER".
Therefore, the following code must be used:

```wl
HChangeName(CUSTOMER, """DBO"".""CUSTOMER""")
```

<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Miscellaneous
<a name="miscellaneous_ELTPARAGRAPHE000205"></a>

- If the management of ".REP" is enabled ([HSetREP](../WDLang4/3044061.md)), the modification of the path is saved in the ".REP" file (see [management of .REP files](../WDLang4/3044186.md)). 

- **HChangeName** is equivalent to **HSubstName**, available in WINDEV 5.5/WEBDEV 1.5.
