Defines the password used to create or open a data file. The password is stored and it will be used when opening or creating the data file if no password is specified.

Remarks: 

- **Caution**: A password must be defined to perform a data encryption. The data encryption must be configured during the file description in the data model editor ("Details" tab).

- This password can also be specified in the functions for creating the data file ([HCreation](../WDLang4/3044255.md), [HCreationIfNotFound](../WDLang4/3044254.md)) and for opening the data file ([HOpen](../WDLang4/3044120.md)).

- **Encrypted files in an HFSQL connection**:  **Caution**: The order in which the functions for connecting to an HFSQL Client/Server database are called is important. For more details, see [Optimizing the connection times to the HFSQL Client/Server databases](../WDLang4/9000176.md).

## Example


```wl
// Open a data file with password and error check
HPass(CUSTOMER, "Password")
IF HCreationIfNotFound(CUSTOMER) = False THEN
	Error("HFSQL error: " + HErrorInfo())
	RETURN
END
// HErrorPassword is used to find out whether the error that occurred is a password error
IF HCreationIfNotFound() = False THEN
	// Error details
	IF HErrorPassword() = True THEN
		Error("Invalid password")
		// Code to retry
	END
END
```

## Syntax

`<Result> = HPass(<Data file> [, <Password>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the password is saved,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if an error occurred (insufficient memory for example). [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) and [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) return more details about the problem.




**`<Data file>: (Character string)`**

Name of data file that uses a password. 
If this parameter corresponds to "\*", the password will be used for all the data files described in the analysis. 
This parameter can also correspond to the name of a [group of files (or custom-folder) defined in the analysis](../Editeurs/2011003.md) (not available in Android and Android widget). In this case, the password will be used for all the files of the group. 
If the data file is declared with [HDeclareExternal](../WDLang4/3044204.md), &lt;File name&gt; corresponds to the name of the data file alias.

**`<Password>: (Optional character string)`**

Password associated with the data file. 
If this parameter is not specified or if it corresponds to an empty string (""), no password is defined for the data file. The password size is not limited.
![HFSQL Classic](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HF.png)![HFSQL Client/Server](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HFCS.png) The password of HFSQL files is not case-sensitive.

## Remarks


### When to use HPass?
<a name="when_use_docparampagetitleshort_ELTPARAGRAPHE000143"></a>

**HPass** must be called:

- before the explicit opening or creation functions: [HOpen](../WDLang4/3044120.md), [HCreation](../WDLang4/3044255.md), [HCreationIfNotFound](../WDLang4/3044254.md).

- before the HFSQL functions that access the date files and that automatically open the data files if not already done (read, search, add, ...).




Remarks: 

- If a password is specified in the explicit opening or creation functions ([HOpen](../WDLang4/3044120.md), [HCreation](../WDLang4/3044255.md), [HCreationIfNotFound](../WDLang4/3044254.md)), the password specified in **HPass** is ignored.

- The password of HFSQL files is not sensitive to the case.

- To change a password on an existing data file or add a password to a data file created without a password, you must use [HChangePassword](../WDLang4/1000018781.md).



<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Defining a password on a data file
<a name="defining_password_data_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000188"></a>

A data file will be protected by password if:

- **HPass** was used before the function for creating the data file ([HCreation](../WDLang4/3044255.md) and [HCreationIfNotFound](../WDLang4/3044254.md)),

- the password was specified in the function for creating the data file.




**Remark**: A data file can be password-protected without being encrypted (and conversely). The password is independent of data encryption. The data encryption must be configured during the file description in the data model editor ("Details" tab).
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Deleting the password defined on a data file
<a name="deleting_the_password_defined_data_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000210"></a>

To delete a password on a data file, an automatic modification of data files must be performed.

To do so, perform a modification in the analysis (modify the size of an item for example). In this case, an automatic modification of data files will be proposed when the analysis is generated. You will be able to modify or delete the password associated with one or more data files.

If your data files are already deployed, specify that an automatic modification of data files is required when creating the setup program. The password will be deleted or modified.

**Caution**: don't forget to modify your code accordingly if the password defined for your data files is deleted.
