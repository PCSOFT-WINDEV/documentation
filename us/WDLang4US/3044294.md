## Syntax

`<Result> = HDeleteFile(<Connection> , <Data file path> [, <Options>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the data file was deleted, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if an error occurred (the data file does not exist on the server for example). [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) is used to identify the error.




**`<Connection>: (Character string or Connection variable)`**

Connection in which the data file must be deleted. This connection corresponds to:

- the name of the connection defined in the data model editor or with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

- the name of a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md).




**`<Data file path>: (Character string)`**

Physical name and path of the data file to delete. The path is relative to the database: the name of the database must not be specified in the path. The ".fic" extension of the data file must be specified.

**`<Options>: (Optional Integer constant (or combination of constants))`**

By default, when deleting a data file: 

- the files corresponding to the logs are not deleted, 

- the files corresponding to the transactions are deleted. 




This parameter is used to modify this behavior:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hDeleteLog* | Deletes the Log file and all the logged operations associated with the deleted data file. |
| *hDestroyLink* | Deletes all links related to the deleted data file. |
| *hKeepTRS* | Keeps the transaction file associated with the deleted data file. |

## Remarks


### Deleting a data file
<a name="deleting_data_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000152"></a>

The data file can be deleted only if it is not currently used (which means if it is not used by a query, a view, another window, a thread or a component with independent HFSQL context).

The data file is automatically closed in the HFSQL context that calls **HDeleteFile**. A WLanguage error occurs if the data file is used in a context or by an application.

### Names of files and directories on the LINUX server
<a name="names_files_and_directories_the_linux_server_ELTPARAGRAPHE000165"></a>

On a LINUX server, the name of data files (.fic, .ftx, .ndx and .mmo files if they exist) must be written in lowercase and they must not contain any accented characters.
