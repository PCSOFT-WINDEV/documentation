## Example


```wl
INTERNAL PROCEDURE OnRedis(nType is int, sChannel is string, bufMessage is Buffer)
	SWITCH nType
		CASE redisSubscribe
			Trace("Subscription to " + sChannel) 
		CASE redisUnsubscribe
			Trace("Cancel subscription to " + sChannel) 
		CASE redisDisconnection
			Trace("Disconnection: " + sChannel)		
		CASE redisMessage
			Trace("Message on " + sChannel+": " + UTF8ToString(bufMessage))
		OTHER CASE
			Trace("Unknown")
		END
	END

RedisSubscribe(gRedis, "MyChannel", OnRedis)

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = RedisSubscribe(<Connection> , <Channel> , <WLanguage procedure>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> is successfully subscribed, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise.




**`<Connection>: (redisConnection variable)`**

Name of the [redisConnection](../WDLang4/1000023527.md) variable that corresponds to the Redis server connection.

**`<Channel>: (Character string)`**

Name of the broadcast channel to which it is necessary to subscribe in order to receive messages. 

**`<WLanguage procedure>: (Procedure name)`**

Name of the WLanguage procedure ("callback") called: 

- when a message is received,

- when subscribing,

- when unsubscribing,

- when disconnecting. 


This procedure makes it possible to manage the current message. It will be called in a specific thread. 
This procedure has the following format:

```txt
PROCEDURE <Procedure name>(<Type>, <Subscription channel>, <Message>)
```



- &lt;Type&gt; contains the type of message. This parameter corresponds to one of the following constants: 
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *redisDisconnection* | The connection to the Redis server has been lost.<br><br>If the procedure returns <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>, the application loses its subscription. Otherwise, the application will try to reconnect to the Redis server. |
| *redisMessage* | The application has just received a message. In this case, &lt;Message&gt; contains the body of the message. |
| *redisSubscription* | The application has just subscribed to &lt;Subscription channel&gt;. |
| *redisUnsubscribe* | The application has just unsubscribed from &lt;Subscription channel&gt; |



- &lt;Subscription channelt&gt; is a character string that contains the name of the channel to which the application subscribed.

- &lt;Message&gt; is a buffer that corresponds to the content of the message.
