Transforms the crossed records ([&lt;Source&gt;.Cross](../WDLang4/1000025051.md)) found in a data file into deleted records. The space occupied by the crossed records is freed and it can be re-used during the next additions ([&lt;Source&gt;.Add](../WDLang4/1000024187.md)).

**Reminder**: A crossed record is inactive and it disappears from the index. The data found in this crossed record is not deleted (unlike [&lt;Source&gt;.Delete](../WDLang4/1000025071.md)).
