Adds a scheduling for full backup (with or without differential backup) on the server defined by the connection. This backup scheduling was defined by an [hBackupDescription](../WDLang4/1000017455.md) variable.

## Example


```wl
DatabaseConnection is Connection

// Create a scheduled backup every 5 minutes 
// with a differential backup every minute
hBck is hBackupDescription
hBck.Enabled = True
hBck.WithIndex = True
hBck.Description = "Scheduled backup every N minutes with " + ...
	"an incremental backup every minut on the " + ...
	DBConnection.Database + " created on "+ ...
	DateToString(DateSys(), maskDateSystem) + " at "+  ...
	TimeToString(TimeSys(), "HH:MM:SS:CC")
hBck.Destination = "Backup_" + DBConnection.Database
hBck.LimitNumberBackups = 2
hBck.Source = DatabaseConnection.Database
hBck.SchedulingFull.Month = "*"
hBck.SchedulingFull.DayOfMonth = "*"
// Define the scheduling
dtServerDateTime is DateTime = HInfoServer(DBConnection,hInfoDate)
dtServerDateTime.Minute++
hBck.SchedulingFull.Hour = dtServerDateTime.Hour
hBck.SchedulingFull.Minute = dtServerDateTime.Minute
hBck.SchedulingFull.DayOfWeek = "*"
hBck.SchedulingFull.DayOfMonthOrDayOfWeek = False
hBck.SchedulingDifferential.Month = "*"
hBck.SchedulingDifferential.DayOfMonth = "*"
hBck.SchedulingDifferential.Hour = "*"
hBck.SchedulingDifferential.Minute = "*"
hBck.SchedulingDifferential.DayOfWeek = "*"
hBck.SchedulingDifferential.DayOfMonthOrDayOfWeek = False

// Add the scheduled backup
IF HAddScheduledBackup(DBConnection, hBck) = False THEN
	Error("Failure creating the scheduled backup", ...
		HErrorInfo(hErrFullDetails))
	RETURN
END

## Syntax

`<Result> = HAddScheduledBackup(<Connection> , <Scheduled backup>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the scheduled backup was added,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. 




**`<Connection>: (Character string or Connection variable)`**

Connection for which a scheduled backup will be added. This connection corresponds to: 

- the name of the connection defined in the data model editor or with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

- the name of a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md).




**`<Scheduled backup>: (hBackupDescription variable)`**

Name of the [hBackupDescription](../WDLang4/1000017455.md) variable used.

## Remarks


### Characteristics of backup:
<a name="characteristics_backup_ELTPARAGRAPHE000097"></a>

- Saving the content of an HFSQL server: all databases on the server, one or more databases, one or more data files. This backup can be performed even if one or more databases are currently used.

- **The database will be backed up at its state at the beginning of the backup: the backed up database is consistent.**Some operations are not allowed during the backup: deleting files or databases, updating stored procedures.

- The backup description is performed via the [hBackupDescription](../WDLang4/1000017455.md) variable. You can define:

	- a stored procedure to run BEFORE the backup. This procedure can cancel the backup if necessary.

	- a stored procedure to run AFTER the backup.

### Rights required to add a scheduled backup
<a name="rights_required_add_scheduled_backup_ELTPARAGRAPHE000114"></a>

To add a scheduled backup, the user or user group must have: 

- the rights to perform backups (*hRightsBackup* constant). These rights apply to the servers and to the databases. For example, to perform a full server backup, you must have the rights to perform backups at server level. 

- the rights to manage the tasks (*hRightsManageTask* constant).




To find out whether a user or a group of users has sufficient rights, use [HInfoServerRights](../WDLang4/3044322.md) or [HInfoDatabaseRights](../WDLang4/3044320.md).

To modify the rights granted to a user or to a group of users, use [HModifyServerRights](../WDLang4/3044328.md) or [HModifyDatabaseRights](../WDLang4/3044326.md).

### Operations on a scheduled backup
<a name="operations_scheduled_backup_ELTPARAGRAPHE000144"></a>

Several functions are used to handle a scheduled backup: 

- [HExecuteScheduledBackup](../WDLang4/1000018937.md): Used to run a scheduled backup. 

- [HListScheduledBackup](../WDLang4/1000018868.md): Used to list the scheduled backups. 

- [HModifyScheduledBackup](../WDLang4/1000018932.md): Used to modify the characteristics of a scheduled backup. 

- [HDeleteScheduledBackup](../WDLang4/1000018870.md): Used to delete a scheduled backup. 




You can also: 

- restore a backup with [HRestoreBackup](../WDLang4/1000017230.md).

- delete a backup physically with [HDeleteBackup](../WDLang4/1000017373.md).
