## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000493"></a>
The HFConf.INI file is found at server root. This file is used to define several characteristics of HFSQL Client/Server server.

This file is also used to specify the characteristics of log files created on the server. The log files are text files whose items are separated by TAB characters. The first file line contains the definition of columns. The log files are created by HFLogger.exe (hflogger in Linux).

### INIT section

**Enabled**: Enables the optimization of indexes in background task. This keyword can be set to 0 (no activation) or 1 (activation). By default, this keyword is set to 1 (activation).

If the optimization of indexes in background task is enabled, the indexes of the data files are automatically optimized if the following conditions are fulfilled: 

- the statistics have not been calculated for the data file since at least 7 days. 

- the data file was created since at least 1 day. 

- the number of write operations since the last statistical calculation is greater than 10000 (plus 10% of the number of file records).

### TELEMETRY section
<a name="telemetry_section_ELTPARAGRAPHE000419"></a>

The TELEMETRY section is used to configure the implementation of data transmission for the HFSQL server (telemetry). You can help us improve the product installed by allowing us to collect information regarding the use of product. This optional and anonymous collect allows PC SOFT to improve the product features.

This section contains the following keyword:

**Active**: Enables the transmission of data regarding the use of HFSQL server. The value of this keyword can be: 

- 1 if the transmission of data (telemetry) was enabled when installing the HFSQL server,

- 0 if the transmission of data (telemetry) was refused when installing the HFSQL server.

- another value if no choice was made during the setup regarding the use of telemetry. The question will be asked again during the next setup of HFSQL server.




Remark: If the "TELEMETRY" section does not exist in the HFConf.ini file, the transmission of data regarding the use of product is not enabled for the HFSQL server.
