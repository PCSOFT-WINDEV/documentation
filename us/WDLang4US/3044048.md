<a name="XUse"></a>
<a name="Use"></a>
<a name="description"></a>
Positions on the previous file record according to a browse item. The record is read and the HFSQL variables are updated (Customer.Name for example, which means the *Name* item of *Customer* file).

Values in the browse item are read in descending order (see [remarks](#NOTE0_1) for more details).

Generally, **HReadPrevious** sets the position in the data file during a loop operation.

Several cases may occur after the call to **HReadPrevious**:

- the data file is empty or no record corresponds to the filter (defined by [HFilter](../WDLang4/3044100.md)): no reading is performed and [HOut](../WDLang4/3044094.md) returns <u><u><u>True</u></u></u>.

- the function tries to lock a record that is already locked in read-only: no read operation is performed, [HErrorLock](../WDLang4/3044099.md) returns <u><u><u>True</u></u></u> and [HOut](../WDLang4/3044094.md) returns <u><u><u>True</u></u></u>.
	
	![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Access by JDBC: Locks cannot be managed in databases accessed by JDBC. 




This function can be used with the data files, HFSQL views or queries.

## Syntax

`<Result> = HReadPrevious([<Data file> [, <Browse item>] [, <Options>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the previous record was read,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if an error occurred (lock, end of data file, etc.): the record is not read. This problem can be caused by:

	- a positioning problem (empty file, ...): [HFound](../WDLang4/3044104.md) returns <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> and [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) returns 0.

	- an error: [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) returns an integer other than 0. [HErrorInfo](../WDLang4/3044071.md) returns more details.







**`<Data file>: (Optional character string)`**

Name of data file, HFSQL view or query used. If this parameter corresponds to an empty string, **HReadPrevious** will use the last data file used by the last HFSQL management function (function starting with "H").

**`<Browse item>: (Optional character string)`**

Name of item used to loop through the data file. If this name is not specified, **HReadPrevious** will use:

- *For a data file*: the last browse item used on this file by the last function for HFSQL management (starting with the letter H). If this item does not exist, the best browse item is automatically used. 

- *For a query*: the ORDER BY of query if it exists, otherwise the last item used.

- *For a view*: the sort item of the view (if it exists), otherwise the last item used.




**`<Options>: (Optional constant (or combination of constants))`**

Used to configure:

- the lock set on the record read by **HReadPrevious**.

- the management of duplicates. By default, all the duplicates are browsed.





|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hDistinct* | If duplicates are found, this constant allows you to read a single record among the duplicates. This parameter is taken into account only if the browse is performed on a key item. |
| *hLockNo* | No lock: the record can be read or modified by another application during the reading. |
| *hLockReadWrite* | Lock in read/write: the record currently read cannot be read or modified by another application. |
| *hLockWrite* | Lock in write mode: the record currently read can be read by another application but it cannot be modified by another application. |


![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) The lock options will have no effect if the locks are not supported by the OLE DB provider or by the Native Connector.![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png) The lock options specified by **HReadPrevious** will be ignored. The lock mode specified by [HReadFirst](../WDLang4/3044051.md) or [HReadLast](../WDLang4/3044140.md) will remain effective when **HReadPrevious** and [HReadNext](../WDLang4/3044037.md) are called.

To change the lock mode, use:

- [HReadSeekFirst](../WDLang4/3044036.md) or [HReadSeekLast](../WDLang4/3044034.md),

- [HReadFirst](../WDLang4/3044051.md) or [HReadLast](../WDLang4/3044140.md).

- [HLockRecNum](../WDLang4/3044152.md) or [HUnlockRecNum](../WDLang4/3044194.md).


![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png)  For Native Oracle Connector, a different lock mode can be specified for each record. However, if a transaction was started by [SQLTransaction](../WDLang4/3072029.md) before setting the lock, the lock will only be released at the end of the transaction ([SQLTransaction](../WDLang4/3072029.md) with the *sqlCommit* or *sqlRollBack* constant).![Hyper File 5.5](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HF55.png) The lock options are ignored. Use locking read functions (**HReadPreviousLock**) kept for backward compatibility.![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Access by JDBC: This parameter is ignored.

## Remarks


### Read operation according to a key item or not
<a name="read_operation_according_key_item_not_ELTPARAGRAPHE000258"></a>

If the item is a key, **HReadPrevious** reads the record with the greatest key value. The sort order taken into account is the one specified in the analysis for this key. 

If the item is not a key, **HReadPrevious** reads the previous active record. When browsing the data file, the records will be sorted according to their record number. 
In this case, the selected browse item will appear in red in the code editor and a warning will be displayed in the ["Code" pane](../Editeurs/2027009.md).

**Remark**: The [automatic completion](../Editeurs/2013001.md) proposes the key items only.
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Looping through records that match a condition
<a name="looping_through_records_that_match_condition_ELTPARAGRAPHE000283"></a>

In most cases, [HReadSeek](../WDLang4/3044050.md), [HReadSeekFirst](../WDLang4/3044036.md) and [HReadSeekLast](../WDLang4/3044034.md) are used to position in the data file to perform a browse loop among the records corresponding to a condition. [HReadNext](../WDLang4/3044037.md) and **HReadPrevious** are used to read the next or previous record corresponding to the condition:

- if the item is a key, **HReadPrevious** reads the previous records corresponding to the values less than or equal to the sought value.

- if the item used is not a key, **HReadPrevious** will read the next records corresponding to the values equal to the sought value.




To ignore the search while going to the next or previous record, use one of the following functions:

- [HCancelSeek](../WDLang4/3044157.md)

- [HReadLast](../WDLang4/3044140.md)

- [HReadFirst](../WDLang4/3044051.md)

### Locks
<a name="locks_ELTPARAGRAPHE000324"></a>

By default (&lt;Options&gt; not specified), the record is not locked.

If a lock is erquested (*hLockWrite* or *hLockReadWrite* constant), the record will be read only if this record is not already locked.

![OLE DB](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/OLEDB.png)![Native Connectors (Native Accesses)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/AN.png) The lock options will have no effect if the locks are not supported by the OLE DB provider or by the Native Connector.
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Memos
<a name="memos_ELTPARAGRAPHE000339"></a>

The memos associated with the record can be automatically read (or not) when reading the record. [HSetMemo](../WDLang4/3044139.md) is used to customize this automatic read operation.

If the memos are supported, the associated text memos are read when the record is read. The binary memos are read only when they are explicitly used ([HExtractMemo](../WDLang4/3044072.md)).
<a name="NOTE0_5"></a>


### Miscellaneous
<a name="miscellaneous_ELTPARAGRAPHE000356"></a>

- [HRecNum](../WDLang4/3044063.md) returns the current record number.

- [HChangeKey](../WDLang4/3044151.md) changes the search key while keeping the position on the current record.

- To optimize the first iterations on a data file, use [HOptimize](../WDLang4/3044005.md) on this data file.

- This function replaces **HReadPreviousLock** and **HReadPrevious**, which were kept for compatibility with WINDEV 5.5.
