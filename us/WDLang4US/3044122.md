`<Result> = HRegenerateFile(<Log file> [, <Password> [, <Destination directory>]] [, <Options> [, <Start date and time of restore operation> [, <End date and time of restore operation> [, <Progress bar of restore operation> [, <Reindexing progress bar>]]]]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the data file was regenerated, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. [HError](../WDLang4/3044088.md) is used to identify the error.




**`<Log file>: (Character string)`**

Full name of the log file to use.

**`<Password>: (Optional character string)`**



- Password of the log file (identical to the password defined for the data file). This password is mandatory to specify a destination directory. 

- Empty string ("") if there is no password.




**`<Destination directory>: (Optional character string)`**

Full name of the directory where the data file will be regenerated. 
If this parameter is not defined, the data file is regenerated in its source directory.

**`<Options>: (Optional constant (or combination of constants))`**

Configures the regeneration of the file. The function has no effect by default (no selected option).


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hData* | All the operations stored in the log file are applied to the existing data file. The file data is updated from the data found in the log. |
| *hStructure* | A new empty data file is created from the description of the data file in the log file. If the data file already exists, it is deleted then re-created. |



**`<Start date and time of restore operation>: (Character string or optional DateTime variable)`**

Date and time (in YYYYMMDDHHmmSSCCC format: YYYY: year, MM: month, DD: day, HH: hour, mm: minutes, SS: seconds, CCC: hundredths of a second) from which the operations in the log file will be replayed on the backup file. The data file will be updated. If no date and time is specified, all the operations found in the log file will be replayed.

**`<End date and time of restore operation>: (Character string or optional DateTime variable)`**

Date and time (in YYYYMMDDHHmmSSCCC format: YYYY: year, MM: month, DD: day, HH: hour, mm: minutes, SS: seconds, CCC: hundredths of a second) up to which the operations in the log file will be replayed on the backup file. The data file will be updated. If no date and time is specified, all the operations found in the log file will be replayed.

**`<Progress bar of restore operation>: (Optional control name)`**

Name of the Progress Bar control in the current window. This control will be used to view the progress of the restore operation.

**`<Reindexing progress bar>: (Optional control name)`**

Name of the Progress Bar control in the current window. This control will be used to view the progress of the reindex operation (once the data is restored).
