Temporarily disables (or re-enables) the replication. Replication can be a log-based replication or a universal replication.

The replication between HFSQL data files is automatically managed.

When the replication is "disabled", you have the ability to access the HFSQL Classic data files without storing the information required by the replication. Then, the replication management must be restored.

**Caution: The use of this function is reserved to experienced programmers. We do not advise you to temporarily disable the management of replication and perform modifications on the data files. Indeed, problems may occur during the synchronization.**

Remark: The replication is not available when accessing a database via .

![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) Only the universal replication is available.

// Disables the log-based replication
HSetReplication(False)
// Add a value that will not be replicated
HAdd(Customer)
// Re-enables the log-based replication

### Managing log-based replication between HFSQL databases

`<Result> = HSetReplication(<Management mode>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if replication was supported before the call to **HSetReplication**, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if replication was not supported before using **HSetReplication**.




**`<Management mode>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> to temporarily disable the management of replication, 

- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> to re-enable the management of replication.

### Managing log-based replication (between HFSQL databases) or universal replication

`<Result> = HSetReplication(<Management mode>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer constant)`**

Former management mode of replication (before the modification):


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *rplReplicationDisabled* | Replication was not supported before **HSetReplication** was called. |
| *rplReplicationLogged* | Log-based replication between HFSQL data files was managed before the call to **HSetReplication**. |
| *rplReplicationUniversal* | The replication performed before calling **HSetReplication** was a universal replication (between HFSQL data files and data files handled by a Native Connector, for example).<br>**Remark**: the *rplReplicationHeterogeneous* constant can be used for backward compatibility with the earlier versions. |



**`<Management mode>: (Integer constant)`**

New management mode to use:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *rplReplicationDisabled* | Used to temporarily disable the management of replication. |
| *rplReplicationLogged* | Allows you to perform a log-based replication between HFSQL data files (uses the HFSQL data files with logs). |
| *rplReplicationUniversal* | Used to perform a universal replication (between an HFSQL database and an Oracle database for example).<br>**Remark**: the *rplReplicationHeterogeneous* constant can be used for backward compatibility with the earlier versions. |

## Remarks
The log process is disabled when the replication is disabled. The log process can be re-enabled by [HSetLog](../WDLang4/3044052.md).
