## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000259"></a>
This step allows you to define and choose the different fonts that will be used in the printed document. You can choose and define:

- specific print fonts: these fonts will be available when printing with the WLanguage functions.

- dynamic fonts, that can be used on the screen (in windows, drawings) as well as when printing in WLanguage.




**This step is optional**.

The default font is used if no font is specified for the print job.

- Font: Don't care, 

- Font 0, 

- size: 12 pica, 

- normal style, 

- color: black.




**Caution**: You can only print by using the printer fonts. If the font used is not available, the closest font will be used.

## Print font

The print fonts are created by [iCreateFont](../WDLang5/3046045.md). This function allows you to choose:

- the typeface (name and family)
	Constants for the typeface: 
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *iCourier* | Courier font (fixed character width) |
| *iDefault* | Any font ("Don't care") |
| *iRoman* | Roman font (exotic font) |
| *iSwiss* | Swiss font (quality font) |



- the size (of the characters)

- the attributes (bold, italic, underlined)
	Constants for the attributes: 
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *iBold* | Bold font |
| *iCondensed* | Condensed characters |
| *iExtended* | Extended characters |
| *iItalic* | Italic font |
| *iLarge* | Large characters |
| *iNormal*<br>(default value) | Standard font, without attributes |
| *iStrikeOut* | Strikethrough font |
| *iUnderlined* | Underlined font |



- the color (see the [preset constants](../WDLang5/3010002.md))




The different parameters of the font are defined via several constants.

Each font is associated with a number. To choose the print font, simply use [iFont](../WDLang5/3046014.md).

## Dynamic font
<a name="dynamic_font_ELTTEXTE000307"></a>
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png) You also have the ability to create dynamic fonts. A "Font" variable allows you to create a font that can be used in all the objects of the project: windows, reports, prints, charts, drawings, ...

The dynamic fonts are used to print a text oriented at 90° for example (with the [Angle](../Proprietes/1410086632.md) property of the dynamic font).

To define a dynamic font:

1. Create a variable of type [Font](../Motscles/1514045.md).

2. Define the characteristics of the font:

	- by using [FontCreate](../WDLang1/3060002.md).

	- with the [font properties](../Proprietes/2515045.md): [Angle](../Proprietes/1410086632.md), [StrikeOut](../Proprietes/2513005.md), [Condensed](../Proprietes/2513006.md), [Color](../Proprietes/2510071.md), [Extended](../Proprietes/2513002.md), [Bold](../Proprietes/2513001.md), [Italic](../Proprietes/2513007.md), [Large](../Proprietes/2513012.md), [Name](../Proprietes/2510082.md), [Underline](../Proprietes/2513013.md) and [Size](../Proprietes/2510125.md) properties.







To choose a print font, all you have to do is use [iFont](../WDLang5/3046014.md).

## Printer font

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png) The printer manufacturers install fonts on their printers. These fonts are called "printer" fonts.

Unlike the software fonts (such as  "True Type"), these fonts can be directly accessed by the printer, they do not have to be downloaded.

In the lists of fonts, the printer fonts are identified by a "printer" icon in front of the name of the font.

Caution: unexpected display effects may occur when using the printer fonts.

If you are using printer fonts, these fonts will be interpreted by the printer only. During the print preview, the display of the fonts is managed by Windows. As it does not support these specific fonts, Windows uses the nearest display font.
