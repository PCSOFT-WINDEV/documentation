## Remarks


- To be able to delete a worksheet from an Excel document, there must be at least another worksheet left in the Excel document.

- If the current worksheet is deleted, the new current worksheet corresponds to the next worksheet or the last worksheet.

- If the deleted worksheet is found before the current worksheet, the subscript of the current worksheet is decremented by 1 in order to stay on the same worksheet.
