## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000224"></a>
The Google Contact service is used to manage contacts on Internet. WINDEV and WEBDEV allow you to create an application for synchronizing the contacts of an existing program with the contacts of Google Contact.

**Warning**: Before using a feature linked to Google services, we strongly recommend that you check the license for using this service. Some restrictions may apply. The content of the licenses may change over time.

PC SOFT is in no case responsible for the way the native access functions are used. Make sure that you comply with the license of the service provider.

## How to manage the Google contacts?
<a name="how_manage_the_google_contacts_ELTTEXTE000248"></a>


### Managing the Google contacts
<a name="managing_the_google_contacts_ELTPARAGRAPHE000040"></a>

To manage the Google contacts: 

1. Create a Google account if necessary. This account can be created via the following address:  [http://code.google.com/intl/en/apis/maps/signup.html](http://code.google.com/intl/en/apis/maps/signup.html). Caution: the address of this page may have been modified since the publication date of this page.
	The Google account is identified by an email address and the associated password. 

2. In the code of your application, create a variable of type [gglConnection](../WDLang5/1000018009.md). This variable contains the characteristics of the connection to your Google account.

### Creating a Google contact
<a name="creating_google_contact_ELTPARAGRAPHE000060"></a>

A Google contact can be created via the Google interface or by programming with the WLanguage functions.

To create a Google contact with the WLanguage functions:

1. Create a variable of type [gglContact](../WDLang5/1000017434.md).

2. Define the characteristics of the contact with the [gglContact](../WDLang5/1000017434.md) properties.

3. Validate the creation of the contact with [GglWrite](../WDLang5/1000017401.md).

### Remark
<a name="remark_ELTPARAGRAPHE000084"></a>

If you use a proxy to access Internet, the proxy must be configured ([Proxy](../WDLang3/3043002.md)) to use Google functions.

## How to retrieve a Google contact?
<a name="how_retrieve_google_contact_ELTTEXTE000284"></a>
To retrieve a Google contact: 

1. Declare an array of [gglContact](../WDLang5/1000017434.md) variables.

2. Use the [GglListContact](../WDLang5/1000017344.md) function. This function is used to list the contacts. The contacts found are assigned to the array of gglContact variables.




Example:

```wl
Cnt is gglConnection
...

// Retrieves all the contacts
arrContacts is array of 0 gglContact 
arrContacts = GglListContact(Cnt) 
// Browse the contacts
MyContact is gglContact
FOR EACH MyContact OF arrContacts
	Trace(MyContact.Name)
END
```

### Principle
<a name="principle_ELTPARAGRAPHE000124"></a>

The principle is very simple: You must find the contact to modify or to delete and you must position on this contact before performing the requested operation.
<a name="NOTE4_2"></a>


### Modifying a contact
<a name="modifying_contact_ELTPARAGRAPHE000133"></a>

To modify a contact:

1. Retrieve the list of contacts.

2. Find the contact to modify.

3. Modify the characteristics of the contact.

4. Validate the modifications with [GglWrite](../WDLang5/1000017401.md).




Example:

```wl
Cnt is gglConnection
...

// Retrieves all the contacts
arrContacts is array of 0 gglContact 
arrContacts = GglListContact(Cnt) 
// Browse the contacts
MyContact is gglContact
FOR EACH MyContact OF arrContacts
	IF MyContact.Name = "MOORE" THEN
			MyContact.PostalAddress[1].Address = "34080 Montpellier"
			// Actually update the changes on the server
			GglWrite(Cnt, MyContact)
	END
END
```

<a name="NOTE4_3"></a>

<a name="deleting_contact_ELTPARAGRAPHE000158"></a>

To delete a contact:

1. Retrieve the list of contacts.

2. Find the contact to delete.

3. Delete the contact with [GglDelete](../WDLang5/1000017402.md).




Example:

```wl
Cnt is gglConnection
...

// Retrieves all the contacts
arrContacts is array of 0 gglContact 
arrContacts = GglListContact(Cnt) 
// Browse the contacts
MyContact is gglContact
FOR EACH MyContact OF arrContacts
	IF MyContact.Name = "MOORE" THEN
			// Deletion
			GglDelete(Cnt, MyContact)
	END
END
```
