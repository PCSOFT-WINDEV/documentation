Prints a line (in Windows standard, with a rounded end) at specified coordinates. The print is not started (only [iEndPrinting](../WDLang5/3046053.md) can be used to start the print).

**Remark**: The origin (0,0) is located in the upper-left corner of the sheet. It takes the physical margins of printer into account.

## Example


```wl
// Draws a solid line in red
iNewLine(50, 10, 50, 200, iContinuous, 12, LightRed)
// Draws a solid line in black
iNewLine(50, 10, 5, 100, iContinuous, 12, Black)
// Start printing
iEndPrinting()
```

## Syntax

`<Result> = iNewLine(<X1> , <Y1> , <X2> , <Y2> [, <Style> [, <Thickness> [, <Color>]]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the line was printed,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise.




**`<X1>: (Real)`**

Horizontal coordinate of the beginning of line (in millimeters). Value included between 0 and the page width (returned by [iPageWidth](../WDLang5/3046036.md)).

**`<Y1>: (Real)`**

Vertical coordinate of the beginning of line (in millimeters). Value included between 0 and the page height (returned by [iPageHeight](../WDLang5/3046052.md)).

**`<X2>: (Real)`**

Horizontal coordinate of the end of line (in millimeters). Value included between 0 and the page width (returned by [iPageWidth](../WDLang5/3046036.md)).

**`<Y2>: (Real)`**

Vertical coordinate of the end of line (in millimeters). Value included between 0 and the page height (returned by [iPageHeight](../WDLang5/3046052.md)).

**`<Style>: (Optional integer constant)`**

Type of line.



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *iContinuous* <br>(default value) | Solid line |
| *iDashed* | Dashed line (-----) |
| *iDotAndDash* | Dot-and-dash line (-.-.) |
| *iDotted* | Dotted line (....) |


![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) **Caution**: If &lt;Thickness&gt; is greater than 1, the line will always be a solid line. This parameter can be ignored if it is not supported by the printer driver.

**`<Thickness>: (Optional real)`**

Line thickness (in picas). Default value = 1 (one Pica = 0.353 mm).
To get a thickness of 1 pixel, &lt;Thickness&gt; must be equal to 0. When the thickness increases, it is proportionally distributed between the two sides of line.

**`<Color>: (Optional integer)`**

Color used. If this parameter is not specified, the color used is black. 
This color can correspond to:

- an RGB color (returned by [RGB](../WDLang1/3029012.md)),

- an HSL color (returned by [HSL](../WDLang1/3029057.md)),

- [a WLanguage preset color](../WDLang5/3010002.md).

## Remarks


- The cursor position is not modified when the outline is drawn.

- The dotted type (*iDotted*) or the mixed type (*iDotAndDash*) combined with a thick border may produce unpleasant effects.
