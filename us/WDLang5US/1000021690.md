Prints an image of the signature in a rectangular area. The print job is not started (only [iEndPrinting](../WDLang5/3046053.md) can be used to start the print job).

Remark: This signature will be used to sign the generated PDF files or the duplicates.

## Example


```wl
// Retrieve the list of certificates available on the computer
arrCertificate is array of Certificates
arrCertificate = CertificateList()

// Open report viewer

### Printing a signature defined by a certificate

`<Result> = iPrintSignature(<Type of signature> , <Certificate> , <Label> , <X1> , <Y1> , <X2> , <Y2>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the signature was printed,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> in case of failure.




**`<Type of signature>: (Integer constant)`**

Type and format of the signature: 

- Type of signature: 
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *iSignatureApproval* | Approval signature. An approval signature corresponds to a mark applied by another person to indicate that he/she approves the document content. |

## Remarks


- To print an image in the signature area, use [iPrintImage](../WDLang5/3046017.md): 
	
	```wl
	iPrintSignature(iSignatureApproval, MySignature, "", 150, 200, 250, 250)
	iPrintImage("signature test.jpg", 150, 200, 250, 250)
	```


- In a report created with the report editor, use a Signature control to sign the PDF files. For more details, see [The Signature control](../WDChamp/1410087013.md). 




- **Caution**: For Acrobat to recognize a signed PDF file, the organization that creates the signing certificate must be in the Adobe Approved Trust List ([Adobe Authorized Trust List](https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/kb/trust-services.html)) or in the Certified Document Services program (CDS). 
	If the certificate is not recognized, Acrobat will display the following message: "At least one signature has problems".
