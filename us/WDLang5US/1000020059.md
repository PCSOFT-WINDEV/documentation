Adds a report into a sequence of report prints.

Remark: The sequence of report prints allows you to print different reports one after another, and view them as one in the report viewer. You can add various types of documents in this sequence. For more details, see [Sequencing reports](../WDChamp/9000128.md).

## Example


```wl
iDestination(iViewer)
iSequencingAdd(RPT_Report1)
iSequencingAdd(RPT_Report2, 3)
iSequencingPrint()
```
<a name="Example2"></a>

```wl
// Open report viewer
iDestination(iViewer)
FOR EACH Activities 
	// Adds the report of activities for the current activity
	iSequencingAdd(RPT_Activities, Activities.ActivitiesID, Activities.ActivitiesID)
	// Adds the report of devices corresponding  the current activity
	iSequencingAdd(RPT_Devices, Activities.ActivityName)
END
iSequencingPrint()
```

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`iSequencingAdd(<Report> [, <Parameter 1> [... [, <Parameter N>]]])`
---

**`<Report>: (Character string)`**

Report name: 

- Logical name of report, defined in the report editor.

- Physical name of the report (including its path) if the compiled code is included in the report.




**`<Parameter 1>: (Optional parameters (the type corresponds to the parameter type))`**

Optional parameter expected by the report. This parameter was defined in the report opening code. This parameter can be the name of a view, the name of a memory area, etc.
**Caution**: If lower bounds and upper bounds have been specified for the report, the first two parameters must correspond the lower bound and to the upper bound (respectively).
**Caution:  This parameter is passed to the report by value and not by address**.



**`<Parameter N>: (Optional parameters (the type corresponds to the parameter type))`**

Optional parameter expected by the report. This parameter was defined in the report opening code. This parameter can be the name of a view, the name of a memory area, etc.
**Caution**: If lower bounds and upper bounds have been specified for the report, the first two parameters must correspond the lower bound and to the upper bound (respectively).
**Caution:  This parameter is passed to the report by value and not by address**.

## Remarks


### Initializing the data sources of sequenced reports
<a name="initializing_the_data_sources_sequenced_reports_ELTPARAGRAPHE000076"></a>

Reports are not run when **iSequencingAdd** is called: only their name and parameters are stored. 

These reports are actually run during the call to [iSequencingPrint](../WDLang5/1000019903.md). 

Caution: If the reports in the sequence are based on a query, the query must be initialized by [iInitReportQuery](../WDLang5/1000003046021.md) in the "Initializing" event of the report (and not before the call to **iSequencingAdd**). 


### Managing the page numbers
<a name="managing_the_page_numbers_ELTPARAGRAPHE000095"></a>

If the reports found in the sequencing display the page number, the page numbers will be continued for the different reports. 

For example, if the first report of the sequencing is numbered from 1 to 10, the second report will be numbered from 11 to 20, and so on. 

To force the page number of a report in the sequence, use [iPageNum](../WDLang5/3046013.md) in the desired report. 


### Using global variables
<a name="using_global_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000107"></a>

Sequenced reports can handle global variables in the different WLanguage events associated with the report. In this case, the value of the global variable taken into account is the one of the report or the print preview. 

If the value of a global variable changes between the call to **iSequencingAdd** and [iSequencingPrint](../WDLang5/1000019903.md), its value in the report will be the last value assigned to it.
