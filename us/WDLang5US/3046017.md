<a name="description"></a>
Sends the image to print to the print buffer. The print job is not started (only [iEndPrinting](../WDLang5/3046053.md) can be used to start the print job). The print mode of the image depends on the parameters passed to **iPrintImage**.

**Remark**: This function must not be used to print the background image of a report. To define the background image of a report, use the [BackgroundImage](../Proprietes/2510056.md) property. The [BackgroundImagePrinted](../Proprietes/1000021350.md) property specifies whether the image should be printed with the report.

![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) Only the images in JPEG format can be printed.

## Remarks


### Miscellaneous
<a name="miscellaneous_ELTPARAGRAPHE000252"></a>

- The origin (0,0) is located in the upper-left corner of the sheet. It takes the physical margins of printer into account.

- If the image doesn't fit in the defined zone and if centering was requested (&lt;Scale&gt; = 999), then the centering option is abandoned.

### Printing in an HTML file
<a name="printing_html_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000262"></a>

If **iPrintImage** is used to print an HTML report (created with the report editor), the printed image will be distorted.

### Printing in PDF
<a name="printing_pdf_ELTPARAGRAPHE000273"></a>

If only the coordinates of the upper-left corner of the image are specified, the image width depends on the printer DPI.

When printing in PDF, the PDF and the current printer have the same DPI: in this case, the width of the image in the PDF will correspond to the width of the image in the preview.

When printing in generic PDF, the PDF and the screen have the same DPI (to avoid depending on a printer). The image may not have the requested width.

We advise you to specify the coordinates of the bottom right corner of the image in order to always get the same result (in PDF, in generic PDF, and regardless of the printer DPI).
