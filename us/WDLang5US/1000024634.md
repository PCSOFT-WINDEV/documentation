Configures the report viewer:

- display a message regarding the resources of current computer.

- display or hide the ribbon tabs and buttons. For more details, see [Report viewer](../WDChamp/1011085.md).
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Apercu_Volet_Apercu.gif&type=thumb)


- the export parameters in the [mini-preview window](../WDChamp/1011094.md).




The size and position of the report viewer window can be customized with [iDestination](../WDLang5/3046074.md).

**Remarks**:

- When printing a report created through programming, all the print buttons are shown in the report viewer.

- By default, all the buttons for printing a report created with the report editor are available. **iParameterViewer** can only be used to configure the buttons defined as visible in the report editor. 

- Two additional buttons may appear in the report viewer if the application allows running "Reports & Queries" (provided with WINDEV). ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Apercu_impression%20-%20HC%20N%B0002%201.gif)
These buttons are respectively used to modify the current report and to create a new report with "Reports & Queries". These buttons are displayed only:

	- If the project allows "Reports & Queries" to be run ("Advanced" tab of the project description).

	- If the report can be modified by "Reports & Queries" ("Options" tab of the report description).

## Remarks


### Configuring the report viewer
<a name="configuring_the_report_viewer_ELTPARAGRAPHE000233"></a>

- The configuration defined by **iParameterViewer** is effective until:

	- the next call to [iReset](../WDLang5/3046067.md), 

	- the next call to **iParameterViewer**.




- To configure the report viewer of all application reports, **iParameterViewer** must be used in the project initialization code.

- The buttons of the report viewer can also be configured in the report editor ("UI" tab of the report description). In this case, **iParameterViewer** called before printing the report is used to hide the additional buttons. Buttons that are defined as invisible in the report will always remain invisible.




**Remarks**: 

- If the report viewer allows you to send emails, the email characteristics can be configured using [iParameterExport](../WDLang5/1000017026.md).

- The thumbnail pane can be shown or hidden through programming only.

### Reports not created in the report editor
<a name="reports_not_created_the_report_editor_ELTPARAGRAPHE000264"></a>

When printing reports created through programming (not in the report editor), all the buttons of the toolbar are visible.
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>




### Warning message (syntax 1)
<a name="warning_message_syntax_1_ELTPARAGRAPHE000272"></a>

The warning message appears only when a report is printed.

If the user clicks "No" to prevent the following pages from being displayed, the report viewer remains open on the pages that are already displayed. In this case, the entire document is printed or exported (and not only the pages displayed in the report viewer).
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>




### Configuring the different print modes
<a name="configuring_the_different_print_modes_ELTPARAGRAPHE000282"></a>

You have the ability to configure the options of the different print modes:

- configure the print in a PDF file: [iParameterPDF](../WDLang5/3046007.md).

- configure the sending of emails: [iParameterExport](../WDLang5/1000017026.md).
