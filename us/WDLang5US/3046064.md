## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000395"></a>
The use of bar codes to identify and manage products has become essential.

The principle of bar codes is straightforward: several vertical or square strips of different size and width are used to encode a set of information. 

The information represented by a bar code is a series of numeric or alphanumeric characters. This information can be completed by characters used to simplify the reading or by control characters.

This information can be read: 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) via a dedicated device and retrieved in a WINDEV application. 
	For the QR Code bar codes, you also have the ability to read a bar code found in an image. 




These bar codes can be printed from a WINDEV or WINDEV Mobile application or from a WEBDEV site. 

WINDEV, WINDEV Mobile and WEBDEV allow you to manage several types of bar codes. All these types can be printed. For more details, see [Printing bar codes](../WDLang5/1000019597.md).

<a name="supported_bar_codes_ELTPARAGRAPHE000052"></a>

Different types of bar codes are available. Each one is used in a specific field. Let's see the main types of bar codes managed by WINDEV, WINDEV Mobile and WEBDEV:

- **UPC (Universal Product Code)**: Bar code found on the supermarket products (USA).

- **EAN (European Article Numbering system)**: European extension of the UPC code.

- **INTER2OF5**: Bar code used in the industrial area.

- **CODABAR**: Bar code used in book stores, blood banks.

- **MSI code**: Coding performed bit by bit, each bit being the combination of a solid bar and an empty bar.

- **Code 39**: First alphanumeric bar code developed.

- **Code 128**: Alphanumeric code with high density.

- **DataMatrix code**: Bar code in 2 dimensions, used to code of a lot of information on a small surface. This type of bar code is used for the electronic components for example.

- **417 PDF code**: Bar code in 2 dimensions. This type of bar code can support up to 2000 characters. This type of bar code is used in health care, transportation, ...

- **QR Code**: Bar code in 2 dimensions. This type of bar code is used to store different types of information (Web addresses, text, phone numbers, SMS, ...) and it can be directly used by the cell phones or by the smartphones.

Characteristics supported for this bar code:

- Bar codes with check: the last character of the bar code corresponds to a control character.

- Extended bar code: an extended bar code can contain the 128 characters found in the ASCII code.




The \* character is reserved for START and STOP: it cannot be used in the code (except if the bar code is extended).
<a name="NOTE2_8"></a>




### Code 128 bar code
<a name="code_128_bar_code_ELTPARAGRAPHE000182"></a>




|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CodeBarreCode128.gif)<br> | Alphanumeric code with high density.<br>It is using three different sets of characters. The set of characters used is automatically selected by WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile to draw the smallest possible bar code.  <br>A correction character is automatically generated. Its value is equal to the weighed sum of the values of characters modulo 103. |

**Control characters**

The following control characters are accepted: &lt;FNC1&gt;, &lt;NUL&gt;, &lt;FNC2&gt;, &lt;FNC3&gt;, &lt;FNC4&gt;, .

**Example**: Encoding a FNC1 character before the "CODE &lt;128&gt;" string: "&lt;FNC1&gt;CODE &lt;&lt;128&gt;"

The values specified between &lt; &gt; are encoded as they are (regardless of the selected set of characters).

**Example**: WLanguage code used to print the following EAN128 bar code: (01)93067280205495(3103)018750


```wl
iDestination(iViewer, i100)
iPrintBarCode("01<FNC1>93067280205495<FNC1>3103018750", ...
	BC_EAN128, 20, 20, 90, 90, BC_ControlDigits)
iEndPrinting
```


**Remark**: The brackets are not printed but they are used to separate the data in the text intended to be read by a human being. The &lt;FNC1&gt; character is used to separate the data in a EAN128 bar code. FNC1 is a control character. To insert it into the string to encode, specify the BC_ControlDigits constant (or "Specify the control characters" in the report editor).

**Sets of characters**

By default, the set of characters used is automatically selected by WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile to draw the smallest possible bar code.

The following control characters enable you to specify the set of characters that will be used:

- to specify the set of characters at the beginning of the bar code: &lt;START A&gt;, &lt;START B&gt;, &lt;START C&gt;. If no START is specified, the "CODE A" set is used by default.

- to change the set of characters in the bar code: &lt;CODE A&gt;, &lt;CODE B&gt;, &lt;CODE C>.




By default, control characters are enclosed between "&lt;" and "&gt;". To avoid interpreting these characters as control characters, simply double the first "&lt;":  

- "&lt;C40&gt;" = control character   

- "&lt;&lt;AB&gt;" = &lt;AB&gt; to be encoded in the bar code.




**Example**: WLanguage code used to print a bar code with the following characteristics: the first 3 alphanumeric characters must be in set B and the last 10 ones in set C:  


```wl
iDestination(iViewer, i100)
iPrintBarCode("<START B>ABC<CODE C>0123456789", BC_CODE128, 20, 20, 80, 60, BC_Charsets)
iEndPrinting()
```

- The control characters: The following control characters are accepted: &lt;FNC1&gt;, &lt;NUL&gt;, &lt;PAD&gt;, &lt;STRUCTURED APPEND&gt;, &lt;READER PROGRAMMING&gt;, &lt;05 MACRO&gt;, &lt;06 MACRO&gt;, .

- Set of characters: The choice of the set of characters is optimized in order to write the smallest possible bar code. 
	The following control characters enable you to specify the set of characters that will be used: &lt;ASCII&gt;, &lt;C40&gt;, &lt;TEXT&gt;, &lt;X12&gt;, &lt;EDIFACT&gt;, &lt;BASE256&gt;. The default set of characters is "ASCII". This set must be used to specify a value that is already encoded or to specify another set of characters. To go back to the ASCII code from another set of characters, al you have to do is specify .




By default, control characters are enclosed between "&lt;" and "&gt;". To avoid interpreting these characters as control characters, simply double the first "&lt;":  

- "&lt;C40&gt;" = control character   

- "&lt;&lt;AB&gt;" = &lt;AB&gt; to be encoded in the bar code.

For the ***PDF417 bar codes***, the following characteristics are also supported:

- By default, the size of the matrix is calculated according to the size of the string

- Level of correction calculated according to the length (after compression) of the data to encode:

	- from 1 to 40 characters: level 2

	- from 41 to 160 characters: level 3

	- from 161 to 320 characters: level 4

	- from 321 characters: level 5




- Line height: 4 by default

- Control characters: The accepted control characters are &lt;NUL&gt; and &lt;READER INIT>.

- Set of characters: By default, the choice of the set of characters is optimized in order to write the smallest possible bar code. 
	The following control characters enable you to specify the set of characters that will be used: &lt;TC ALPHA&gt;, &lt;TC LOWER&gt;, &lt;TC MIXED&gt;, &lt;TC PUNCTUATION&gt;, &lt;BC&gt;, .




**Example**: WLanguage code used to print a PDF 147 bar code by specifying the set of characters:


```wl
iPreview(i100)
iPrintBarCode("<READER INIT><TC LOWER>abcd<TC MIXED><TC PUNCTUATION>(?)", ...
	BC_PDF417, 0, 0, 200, 200, BC_ControlDigits + BC_Charsets)
iEndPrinting()
```


By default, control characters are enclosed between "&lt;" and "&gt;". To avoid interpreting these characters as control characters, simply double the first "&lt;":  

- "&lt;C40&gt;" = control character   

- "&lt;&lt;AB&gt;" = &lt;AB&gt; to be encoded in the bar code.
