Opens an Excel file (xls or xlsx files). 

**Remark**: To create an Excel file without using an initial file, you just you have to create a variable of type [xlsDocument](../WDLang5/1000017464.md) (in this case, **xlsOpen** has no effect).

![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) Only the xlsx format is supported.

## Example

Example used to open an Excel file while retrieving an integer


```wl

doc = xlsOpen(fExeDir() + ["\"] + "gpac.xls")

IF ErrorOccurred() THEN
	Error(ErrorInfo())
	RETURN

xlsClose(doc)
```

## Syntax

`<Result> = xlsOpen(<Path of XLS file> [, <Opening mode> [, <Password>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (xlsDocument variable)`**

Name of the [xlsDocument](../WDLang5/1000017464.md) variable corresponding to the XLS file. This variable can be used by all the XLS functions. **Using this type of variable allows you to modify the XLS documents.**


	<B><B><B><B>Warning</B></B></B></B>

	 **Result compatible with version 12.** For compatibility reasons, this variable can be converted to an integer corresponding to the specified XLS file ID. This ID can be used in all XLS functions that support the file ID. This syntax only allows you to read XLS documents: no modification is possible.



In an error occurs, the [ErrorOccurred](../WDLang1/3087001.md) variable is set to <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> and [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) returns the details of the error.

**`<Path of XLS file>: (Character string)`**

Full or relative path of XLS file to open (up to 260 characters).

**`<Opening mode>: (Optional integer constant)`**

Indicates the opening mode of XLS file. 
By default: 

- the Excel file is opened in read-only mode. You can write to the Excel file with another application. 

- the Excel file uses the multi-sheet management mode for XLS files.

| --- | --- |
| *xlsCompatible* | Used to open the Excel file in mode compatible with version 10. <br><br>In this mode: <br><br>- A single workbook sheet is supported. <br><br>- Unicode is not supported. <br><br>- The groups of strings are not supported. <br><br>- Some functions ([xlsData](../WDLang5/3080021.md) or [xlsNbRow](../WDLang5/3080011.md) for example) may return inconsistent results.<br><br><br><br>	<B><B><B><B>Warning</B></B></B></B><br><br>	From version <B><B><B><B>11</B></B></B></B>, this constant is available for backward compatibility.<br>
 |
| *xlsWrite* | Opens the Excel file in "Read/Write" mode: the XLS file is opened and locked until it is closed. <br>Caution: the modifications performed in the XLS file will be taken into account only if you are using an [xlsDocument](../WDLang5/1000017464.md) variable. |



**`<Password>: (Optional character string)`**

Password to open the XLS file to use.

## Remarks


### Using the XLS functions in read/write
<a name="using_the_xls_functions_readwrite_ELTPARAGRAPHE000116"></a>

To handle the XLS files in read/write, you must use an [xlsDocument](../WDLang5/1000017464.md) variable. This type of variable can also be used to handle the files specific to Office 2007 (.xlsx files) in read/write.

The use of the file identifier is kept for backward compatibility with version 12. The XLS documents (including the ".xlsx" files specific to Office 2007) handled with this identifier cannot be modified (even if the *xlsWrite* constant is specified).

Example using the syntax kept for backward compatibility: 


```wl
XLSFileID is int
XLSFileID = xlsOpen(CompleteDir(fExeDir()) + "GPACS.XLS")
IF ErrorOccurred = False THEN
		Info("The XLS file was opened")
		// Close the file 
		xlsClose(XLSFileID)
	ELSE
		Info(ErrorInfo())
	END
END
```

<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### The XLS file cannot be opened
<a name="the_xls_file_cannot_opened_ELTPARAGRAPHE000132"></a>

The possible error cases are as follows: 

- The specified XLS file was not found.

- The specified XLS file does not exist.

- The specified XLS file cannot be opened.

- The specified XLS file is invalid.

- Insufficient memory to open the XLS file.

- The version of Excel used is unknown or too old (the XLS functions cannot read the files in Excel version 2 or earlier).




To get more details on the error, use [xlsMsgError](../WDLang5/3080016.md) (if your are using version-12-compatible syntax) or [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) with the *errMessage* constant.
