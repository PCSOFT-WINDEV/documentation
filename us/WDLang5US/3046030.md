## Syntax

`iPrintBlock(<Block name>)`
---

**`<Block name>: (Character string)`**

Logical name of block to print.  



<a name="NOTE0"></a>
<a name="NOTE0_1"></a>

## Remarks


- **iPrintBlock** cannot be used in the following events:

	- "Opening" the report.

	- "Before printing" of a page header block.

	- "Before printing" of a page footer block.




- In most cases, we recommend that you use planes in the report as they are easier to use and to implement (rather than block substitution). For more details, see [The planes](../WDChamp/1013078.md).
