- [gglCalendar](../WDLang5/1000017418.md) variable to delete a calendar.

- [gglContact](../WDLang5/1000017434.md) variable to delete a contact.

	 Since June 15, 2021, the Google Contacts API used by this feature to manage contacts and contact groups is no longer available ([https://developers.google.com/contacts/v3/announcement](https://developers.google.com/contacts/v3/announcement)). 
To use Google contacts, refer to the People API published by Google as a replacement :  [https://developers.google.com/people](https://developers.google.com/people). 
[Send](../WDLang3/1410089811.md) allows you to easily integrate a REST API in your development projects.
