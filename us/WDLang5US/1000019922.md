The **Watermark** type is used to handle the text printed in watermark in the reports created with the report editor or through programming.

The **Watermark** type is used to define the advanced characteristics of the text in watermark. The characteristics of this text can be defined and modified using different WLanguage properties.

**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

## Example


```wl
// Print a watermark in report background
MyWatermark is Watermark

// Text of the watermark
MyWatermark.Text = "Confidential"
// Font used
MyWatermark.Font.Name = "Arial"
// The watermark will be horizontally centered at bottom
MyWatermark.Position = iCenterH + iBottom

// Print in the report viewer
iDestination(iViewer)

// Indicates that the watermark will be printed during the print and in the duplicates
iParameterWatermark(iwatermarkPrinting + iwatermarkDuplicate, MyWatermark)

// Starts printing the report
iPrintReport(RPT_Commercial)
```

### Properties specific to Watermark variables
<a name="properties_specific_watermark_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000041"></a>

The following properties can be used to handle a text as watermark:

| Property name | Type used | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Angle | Integer constant | Tilt angle of the watermark text. This angle can correspond to one of the following constants: <br><br>- *iFontAngle*: the tilt angle of the text corresponds to the angle defined in the font. <br><br>- *iDownwardDiagonal*: the text is printed on a 45° downward diagonal. <br><br>- *iUpwardDiagonal*: the text is printed on a 45° upward diagonal. <br><br>- *iHorizontal*: the text is printed horizontally.<br><br><br><br><br>Before version 24, this property was named "Orientation". |
| Font | [Font](../Motscles/1514045.md) variable | Characteristics of the font that must be used for the watermark text. |
| Opacity | Integer | Watermark text opacity percentage. This percentage varies from 0 (invisible text) to 100 (totally opaque text). |
| Position | Integer constant | Constant (or combination of constants) used to define the position of watermark text: <br><br>- *iBottom*: the text is aligned at the bottom of the text area. <br><br>- *iCenterH*: the text is horizontally centered in the text area. <br><br>- *iCenterV*: the text is vertically centered in the text area. <br><br>- *iRight*: the text is aligned on the right of the text area<br><br><br> |
| Size | Integer constant | Font size. This size corresponds to one of the following constants:  <br><br>- *iAutomatic*: the font size is automatically chosen according to the length the watermark text and to the width of report. <br><br>- *iFontSize*: the size defined in the font is used.<br><br><br> |
| Text | Character string | Text of the watermark. |
