// Positions at the root of document
XMLRoot(:m_sDocName)
LOOP
	// Finds all the "txsr" from the root in order to delete them
	XMLFind(:m_sDocName, CParagraph::CST_TAG, XMLTag + XMLChildItem + XMLContinue, ...
		XMLExact)

## Syntax

`<Result> = XMLDelete(<XML document>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the deletion is performed,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. In this case, the [ErrorOccurred](../WDLang1/3087001.md) variable is set to <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md).




**`<XML document>: (Character string)`**

XML document from which the deletion will be performed. 

- If the current element is an attribute, the attribute will be deleted. 

- If the current element is a tag, the tag will be deleted as well as all its attributes and all its child elements.  






<a name="NOTE0"></a>
<a name="NOTE0_1"></a>

## Remarks


### Current position
<a name="current_position_ELTPARAGRAPHE000089"></a>

After the deletion, the current position is moved toward the parent of deleted element.
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Deleting an element during a search
<a name="deleting_element_during_search_ELTPARAGRAPHE000096"></a>

When used on a search, **XMLDelete** cancels the search. Example to avoid (this code does not operate):


```wl
// Positions at the root of document
XMLRoot(:m_sDocName)
// Finds all the "txsr" from the root in order to delete them
XMLFind(:m_sDocName, CParagraph::CST_TAG, XMLTag + XMLChildItem + XMLContinue, XMLExact)
WHILE XMLFound(:m_sDocName)
	XMLDelete(:m_sDocName)
     // Next element in the search
	XMLNext(:m_sDocName)
END
XMLCancelSearch(:m_sDocName)
```
The code to use is given in example of the function.
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Saving the modifications in the XML file
<a name="saving_the_modifications_the_xml_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000108"></a>

To save the modifications performed in an XML file, you must:

1. Use the [XMLBuildString](../WDLang5/3081016.md) function. This function retrieves and formats the content of an XML document.

2. Save the character string generated by [XMLBuildString](../WDLang5/3081016.md) in an XML file. To do so, use the [fSaveText](../WDLang1/3036046.md) function.




Example:

```wl
// Once the XML document was modified 
XMLSource = XMLBuildString("XMLDoc")
// Save the XML file
fSaveText("ModifiedExample.xml", XMLSource)
```
