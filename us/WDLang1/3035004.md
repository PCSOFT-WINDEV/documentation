## Syntax

### Terminating an application identified by its name

`<Result> = ExeTerminate(<Executable name>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if all the instances of the program have been deleted, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if a problem occurs. This function may fail:

	- if the executable is not instantiated (the executable is not run). 

	- if the user has no sufficient rights to destroy one of the instances. 







**`<Executable name>: (Character string)`**

Name and full (or relative) path of the executable (up to 260 characters).

### Terminating an application identified by its process ID (PID)

`<Result> = ExeTerminate(<Process ID>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if all the instances of the program have been deleted, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if a problem occurs. This function may fail:

	- if the executable is not instantiated (the executable is not run). 

	- if the user has no sufficient rights to destroy one of the instances. 







**`<Process ID>: (Integer)`**

Process ID (PID) of the application. This identifier is returned by [ExeRun](../WDLang1/3035006.md) (associated with the *exePID* constant) or by [ExeGetPID](../WDLang1/1000017239.md).
