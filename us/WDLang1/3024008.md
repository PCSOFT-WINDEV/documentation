Calculates: 

- the number of occurrences of a specific character string (by respecting the search criteria) in another character string.

- the number of occurrences of a set of strings in an array.

## Example


```wl
Res = StringCount("anastasia", "a")         // Returns 4
Res = StringCount("toto titi tito", "to")   // Returns 3
Res = StringCount("toaster", "X")       // Returns 0
Res = StringCount("An Indian hunts an eagle", "an") // returns 2
Res = StringCount("An Indian hunts an eagle", "an", WholeWord) // returns 1
Res = StringCount("An Indian hunts an eagle", "an", IgnoreCase) // Returns 3
Res = StringCount("An Indian hunts an eagle", "an", IgnoreCase + WholeWord) // Returns 2
```
<a name="Example2"></a>

```wl
Res = StringCount("anastasia", ["a","s"])         // Returns 6
```

## Syntax

### Number of occurrences of a character string

`<Result> = StringCount(<Initial string> , <Search string> [, <Options>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**



- Number of occurrences, 

- 0 if no occurrence exists or if &lt;Search string&gt; corresponds to an an empty string ("").




**`<Initial string>: (Character string)`**

Text in which the occurrences of &lt;Search string&gt; must be found.

**`<Search string>: (Character string)`**

Text to find in &lt;Initial string&gt;.

**`<Options>: (Optional constant (or combination of constants))`**

Search options: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *IgnoreCase* | Searches ignoring the case (uppercase/lowercase characters). |
| *WholeWord* | Searches for a whole word, i.e, between spaces or punctuation characters (characters other than a letter or a digit).<br> |




<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Number of occurrences of strings in an array

`<Result> = StringCount(<Initial string> , <Array of search strings> [, <Options>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**



- Number of occurrences, 

- 0 if there are no occurrences or if &lt;Array of search strings&gt; contains empty strings ("").




**`<Initial string>: (Character string)`**

Text in which the occurrences of &lt;Search string&gt; must be found.

**`<Array of search strings>: (Array)`**

Name of the array that contains the strings to be found in the &lt;Initial string&gt;.

**`<Options>: (Optional constant (or combination of constants))`**

Search options: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *IgnoreCase* | Searches ignoring the case (uppercase/lowercase characters). |
| *WholeWord* | Searches for a whole word, i.e, between spaces or punctuation characters (characters other than a letter or a digit).<br> |

## Remarks


### Search in an array: managing ambiguities
<a name="search_array_managing_ambiguities_ELTPARAGRAPHE000111"></a>

When the search strings are substrings of other strings in the array, the longest strings are taken into account.

Example: If the ["after", "afternoon", "afterward"] array of strings must be found in "Come this afternoon after the game", the first occurrence found will be "afternoon" (and not "after").

### StringCount and UNICODE
<a name="docparampagetitleshort_and_unicode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000126"></a>

You have the ability to use ANSI strings, Unicode strings and buffers in the different parameters of the function.

The following conversion rule is used for the Ansi systems (Windows or Linux):

- If at least one of the strings is a buffer, all the strings are converted to buffers and the operation is performed with buffers.

- If the first condition is not met and there is at least one Unicode string, all the strings are converted to Unicode and the operation is performed in Unicode (the conversion is performed with the current character set, if necessary).

- Otherwise, the operation is performed in Ansi.




The conversion rule used for Unicode systems is as follows:

- If at least one of the strings is a buffer, all the strings are converted to buffers and the operation is performed with buffers.

- Otherwise, the operation is performed in Unicode.




For more details on UNICODE, see [Managing UNICODE](../WDLang1/3024038.md).

Reminder: The linguistic parameters used are defined during the call to [ChangeCharset](../WDLang1/3054001.md).
