The following functions are used to manage the Windows registry:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [RegistryCopyKey](../WDLang1/1000019418.md) | Copies a registry key with all its subkeys and values. |
| [RegistryCreateKey](../WDLang1/3065002.md) | Creates a key in the Windows registry. |
| [RegistryDeleteKey](../WDLang1/3065010.md) | Deletes a subkey from the Windows registry. |
| [RegistryDeleteValue](../WDLang1/3065011.md) | Deletes a value from the Windows registry. |
| [RegistryExist](../WDLang1/3065007.md) | Checks the existence of a key in the Windows registry. |
| [RegistryFirstSubKey](../WDLang1/3065008.md) | Identifies the path of first subkey of specified key in the Windows registry. |
| [RegistryListKey](../WDLang1/1000019881.md) | Lists the sub-keys of a registry key. |
| [RegistryListValue](../WDLang1/3065013.md) | Returns the name (and possibly the type) of values for a key found in the registry. |
| [RegistryNextKey](../WDLang1/3065009.md) | Identifies the key found after the specified key in the Windows registry. |
| [RegistryQueryValue](../WDLang1/3065012.md) | Reads a value in the Windows registry. |
| [RegistryRename](../WDLang1/1000019419.md) | Renames a key in the registry. |
| [RegistrySeek](../WDLang1/3065005.md) | Seeks a character string in the registry. |
| [RegistrySetValue](../WDLang1/3065006.md) | Writes a value to a key in the Windows registry. |
| [RegistryValueType](../WDLang1/1000017280.md) | Returns the type of value found in the registry. |

- ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WDEvaluationperiod.gif) ***Training (WINDEV)*** : **WD Evaluation period** <br>This example explains how to limit the use of an application to a given period (evaluation period).<br>The following topics are presented in this example:<br>	1/ the protection of an application for a given duration<br>	2/ the management of the registry<br><br>Summary of the example supplied with WINDEV:	<br>When this example is started for the first time, it is activated for an evaluation period set to 5 days.<br>The information regarding the date when it was first started is stored in the registry and a control key is used to check whether this date was not modified by the end user. At the end of the evaluation period, the application is locked, unless the end user provides the code for unlocking the application
- ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WDDeviceOpening.gif) ***Training (WINDEV)*** : **WD Device Opening** <br>When inserting a removable device (USB key, and so on), the operating system of Windows proposes a list of preset actions to open the files found in this device.<br>The set of procedures proposed in this example will allow you to easily add or delete an application to/from the automatic opening system for the removable devices by programming.
- ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WDPersistence.gif) ***Training (WINDEV)*** : **WD Persistence** <br>This example presents the use of InitParameter, LoadParameter and SaveParameter.<br>These functions are used to configure the backup of controls, variables and other parameters.<br>This example is divided into three parts:<br>	- The configuration<br>	- The manual management of variables (SaveParameter and LoadParameter)<br>	- The optimization<br>1°) Configuration	<br><br>	The configuration window enables you to modify the location of the backup of parameters (registry, INI file, XML file) as well as its path (registry key or file path).<br>2°) Manual management of the variables<br>	The manual management enables you to save the content of the variables via SaveParameter and to restore them via LoadParameter. Each parameter is identified by a name. These values are saved at the location defined in the configuration window.<br>3°) The optimization<br>	This window explains how to optimize your code to avoid the slowness caused when the saved values are restored. Indeed, when restoring the value of a control, its modification code is run. If you have long processes (queries with parameters for instance), this window shows you how to speed up the loading of the window.
