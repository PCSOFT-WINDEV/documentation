## Syntax

`ThreadPause(<Timeout>)`
---

**`<Timeout>: (Integer)`**

Timeout defined for the thread (in hundredths of a second). This parameter can correspond to: 

- an integer corresponding to the number of hundredths of a second,

- a Duration variable,

- a duration in a readable format (e.g., '1s' or '10cs').

## Remarks


- It is recommended to use **ThreadPause** instead of [Multitask](../WDLang1/3015004.md) or [Timeout](../WDLang1/3015012.md) when several threads are used (including the main application thread) if the timeout does not need to process user actions.

- In a Service application, **ThreadPause** must be replaced with [ServiceWait](../WDLang1/1000018712.md).
