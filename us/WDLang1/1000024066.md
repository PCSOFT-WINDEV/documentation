## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000096"></a>
Implementing input suggestions in an Edit control is very simple: when the user starts to type in an Edit control, a list automatically opens below the control and shows the values that start with the characters being typed. 

Input suggestions can be implemented in the editor or be customized programmatically.

## Principle
<a name="principle_ELTTEXTE000140"></a>
WINDEV, WINDEV Mobile and WEBDEV include several types of input suggestions: 

- In-memory input suggestions: The Edit control is not bound to an item in a data file. The automatic input is made from a list of data provided in the code ([&lt;Edit&gt;.AddAssistedInput](../WDLang1/1000023671.md)). The data from the list is displayed according to the input.  

- Input suggestions based on a data file: The Edit control is bound to an item in a data file or query. The data from the list is displayed according to the input.

- Input suggestions defined programmatically: Suggestions come from a custom set of data. The display of data in the list according to the input is customized.

### How to?
<a name="how_ELTPARAGRAPHE000202"></a>

To implement in-memory input suggestions: 

1. Use [&lt;Edit&gt;.AddAssistedInput](../WDLang1/1000023671.md) to add the elements that will appear in the input suggestions. 
	You can add: 

	- a simple value, which will appear in the list of input suggestions,

	- one value that will be displayed and one value that will be stored.

	- a variable of type [AssistedInput](../WDLang1/1410088983.md).




2. If necessary, use [&lt;Edit&gt;.ConfigureAssistedInput](../WDLang1/1000024064.md) to configure the input suggestions: filter, list opening, number of characters typed before opening the list, ...




**Remark**: The stored value allows you to associate a specific value to an input suggestion. You can use this value to perform a specific process according to the type of value selected.


### Examples
<a name="examples_ELTPARAGRAPHE000242"></a>

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) **Example for a window**: 
	
	```wl
	// End of window initialization
	EDT_Find.ConfigureAssistedInput(aiMinSize, 3)
	EDT_Find.ConfigureAssistedInput(aiFilter, filterContains)
	
	FOR EACH STRING sTitle OF gsPhotoTitles SEPARATED BY CR
		EDT_Find.AssistedInputAdd(sTitle)
	END
	```






### Remarks
<a name="remarks_ELTPARAGRAPHE000273"></a>

- The optional "Select a value in the list of input suggestions" event is executed when an element is selected. This event takes a variable of type [AssistedInput](../WDLang1/1410088983.md) as parameter. This variable allows you to get the selected value and the associated stored value, if any.

- By default, the value displayed in the Edit control is the value is selected in the input suggestions. To change the value in the Edit control, use the "Select a value in the list of input suggestions" event. You can choose to display the stored value instead, for example. 


For more details, see [Events associated with Edit controls](../WDChamp/1013229.md).

## "Browsing" assisted input
<a name="browsing_assisted_input_ELTTEXTE000287"></a>


### How to?
<a name="how_ELTPARAGRAPHE000310"></a>

To implement input suggestions based on a data file: 

1. In the Edit control description window: 

	- Check whether the Edit control is bound to an item in a data file or query ("Binding" tab). 
			Caution: The item must be a key. 

	- In the "Details" tab, check "Assisted input based on data binding". 




2. Validate the Edit control description window. 




At runtime, as soon as the first letter is typed in the control: 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) the first result that matches the entered character is displayed. The matching data changes as you type. 




Remarks: 

- If the Edit control is bound to a query item, the query is automatically executed. However, if the query expects parameters, you must specify them (e.g., in the "Global declarations" or "End of initialization" events of the window) and then execute the query with [&lt;Source&gt;.ExecuteQuery](../WDLang4/1000024944.md).  

- Input suggestions are shown using a "Starts with" filter. To use another filter, you must define input suggestions programmatically.

## Input suggestions defined programmatically
<a name="input_suggestions_defined_programmatically_ELTTEXTE000347"></a>


### How to?
<a name="how_ELTPARAGRAPHE000370"></a>

By defining input suggestions programmatically, you can use a custom data source. 

To use input suggestions defined programmatically: 

1. Disable the default filter with [&lt;Edit&gt;.ConfigureAssistedInput](../WDLang1/1000024064.md) (using the *filterNone* constant). Thus, the list of input suggestions can be opened and display all the specified elements.  

2. In the "Whenever modifying" event of the Edit control: 

	- Clear the list of suggestions ([&lt;Edit&gt;.DeleteAllAssistedInput](../WDLang1/1000024065.md)). 

	- Rebuild the list of elements proposed according to the characters typed ([&lt;Edit&gt;.AddAssistedInput](../WDLang1/1000023671.md)).

	- Use [&lt;Edit&gt;.OpenAssistedInput](../WDLang1/1000024063.md) to open the list of input suggestions.








### Example
<a name="example_ELTPARAGRAPHE000409"></a>


```wl
// "Contains" search performed in the name 
// and code of an array of stock shares
FOR EACH sName, sCode of gArrShare
	IF Contains(sCode, sSoughtValue) _OR_ ...
		Contains(sName, sSoughtValue) THEN
		SAI_Programmed_mode.AssistedInputAdd(sName)
	END
END
```
