## Syntax

### Writing a line into an external file

`<Result> = <File used>.WriteLine(<Line to write>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the write operation was performed into the specified file, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if an error occurs. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) with the *errMessage* constant.




**`<File used>: (DiskFile variable)`**

Name of the [DiskFile](../WDLang1/1410088883.md) variable initialized with [fOpen](../WDLang1/3036036.md) or [fCreate](../WDLang1/3036017.md).

**`<Line to write>: (Character string)`**

Line that must be written into the file (up to 2GB).

### Writing a fixed-length line into an external file (speeds up the write operation)

`<Result> = <File used>.WriteLine(<Address of line to write> , <Size to write>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the write operation was performed into the specified file, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if an error occurs. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) with the *errMessage* constant.




**`<File used>: (DiskFile variable)`**

Name of the [DiskFile](../WDLang1/1410088883.md) variable initialized with [fOpen](../WDLang1/3036036.md) or [fCreate](../WDLang1/3036017.md).

**`<Address of line to write>: (Address)`**

Address of the line that must be written into the file.

**`<Size to write>: (Integer)`**

Size in bytes (characters) of the line that must be written (up to 2GB).
This parameter must be less than or equal to the real size of the wine written into the external file. For example, if the size of the line to write is equal to 100 bytes, &lt;Size to write&gt; must be less than or equal to 100 bytes.
If this parameter is less than the real size of the written line, only the specified number of bytes will be written into the text file. The line will be truncated.

## Remarks


### Handling errors
<a name="handling_errors_ELTPARAGRAPHE000347"></a>

**&lt;DiskFile variable&gt;.WriteLine** throws an error in the following cases:

- the file is not opened, 

- the file is not accessible in write mode, 

- the file is locked by another computer or by another application, 

- no disk space is available.




**Caution**: **&lt;DiskFile variable&gt;.WriteLine** can only be used on text files. This function does not support the binary 0 (the write operation is stopped).

### Operating mode in Windows Vista (and later)
<a name="operating_mode_windows_vista_and_later_ELTPARAGRAPHE000373"></a>

If this function does not operate properly in Windows Vista (and later), check whether the file or directory used is not in one of the system directories (Windows directory or "Program Files" directory).

**In Windows Vista (and later), with the [UAC mechanism](../Editeurs/2025014.md) (User Account Control) enabled**, you must have administrator privileges to handle and/or modify the files or directories in system directories (Windows directory or "Program Files" directory).

**Programming tip**: To handle and/or modify the files or directories without administrator privileges, you should:

- avoid writing to the Windows directory or to the "Program Files" directory, 

- use the system directory of the application (returned by [SysDir](../WDLang1/3073026.md) with the *srAppDataCommun* constant, for example).


**Remark**: In Windows Vista (and later), the virtualization mechanism is used to make the applications compatible with Vista. If the file is created in a system directory without having sufficient rights, this file will actually be created in another directory (C:\\Users\\&lt;LOGIN&gt;AppData\\Local\\VirtualStore\\Windows\\). In this case, the file cannot be shared between several applications.
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Position in the file
<a name="position_the_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000396"></a>

When opening a file, the current position corresponds to:

- the first file byte (by default), 

- the last byte of the file is the file is opened in "addition" mode (*foAdd* constant).




This position can be modified by [&lt;DiskFile variable&gt;.Seek](../WDLang1/1410089048.md).

**&lt;DiskFile variable&gt;.WriteLine** writes the specified elements from the current position. Once **&lt;DiskFile variable&gt;.WriteLine** has been executed, the current position is set to the last byte written.

### Managing the ANSI/UNICODE format
<a name="managing_the_ansiunicode_format_ELTPARAGRAPHE000422"></a>

**&lt;DiskFile variable&gt;.WriteLine** is used to write: 

- a Unicode string in a Unicode file. 

- an Ansi string in an Ansi file. 




The file is created or opened with [fCreate](../WDLang1/3036017.md)/[fOpen](../WDLang1/3036036.md) by specifying the file type.

**Remarks**: 

- The size to write into Unicode file a must be multiplied by two compared to an ANSI file.

- If a character string in ANSI format is written into a UNICODE file (and conversely), the conversion will be implicitly performed.

|   | **Format of the string passed as parameter** | **External file <br>in ANSI format<br>([fOpen](../WDLang1/3036036.md) or [fCreate](../WDLang1/3036017.md) associated with the *foAnsi* constant)** | **External file <br>in UNICODE format<br>([fOpen](../WDLang1/3036036.md) or [fCreate](../WDLang1/3036017.md) associated with the *foUnicode* constant)** |
| **&lt;DiskFile variable&gt;.WriteLine** function | ANSI | No conversion is required before the write operation | Automatic conversion of the string before the write operation |
| UNICODE | Automatic conversion of the string before the write operation | No conversion is required before the write operation |






In WINDEV and WEBDEV projects, if the "Use ANSI strings at runtime" option is enabled in the project configuration description, the default opening mode is *foAnsi* (1st column).

In WINDEV and WEBDEV projects, if the "Use UNICODE strings at runtime" option is enabled in the project configuration description, the default opening mode is *foUnicode* (second column).

In the WINDEV Mobile projects, regardless of the version and mode, the opening mode used by default is *foUnicode* (second column).
