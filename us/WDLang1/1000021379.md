## Remarks


### "Request for refreshing the display" event
<a name="request_for_refreshing_the_display_event_ELTPARAGRAPHE000075"></a>

One of the events associated with the window (or page) is "Request for refreshing the display". This event is used to group the code for refreshing the window (or page) controls: content of controls, state (visible, grayed, etc.), caption to refresh, etc.

This event can receive parameters. Simply declare a procedure in the event. For example: 


```wl
// Request for refreshing the display
PROCEDURE AskForRefresh(RefreshType is Boolean)
```


This event is started upon request by the following functions: 

- [RequestUpdateUI](../WDLang1/1000021378.md): Runs the event "Request for refreshing the display" at the end of the current process (asynchronous execution). 

- **ExecuteUpdateUI**: Immediately runs the event "Request for refreshing the display". 

- [RequestUpdateUIParent](../WDLang1/1000022961.md): Runs the event "Request for refreshing the display" of the higher level at the end of the current process (asynchronous execution).

- [ExecuteRefreshUIParent](../WDLang1/1000022961.md): Immediately runs the event "Request for refreshing the display" of the higher level.


When these functions are called, you can specify the value of the parameters expected by "Request for refreshing the display". 

Remark: The event "Request for refreshing the display" can also be immediately run by [ExecuteProcess](../WDLang1/3013031.md) with the following syntax: 


```txt
ExecuteProcess(<Element name>, trtRequestRefresh)
```

### MVP: "Presenter" attribute
<a name="mvp_presenter_attribute_ELTPARAGRAPHE000114"></a>

The **presenter** attribute is used to associate a class of the presenter layer with a view (window, page or report). This attribute is mainly used in the global declaration of the windows generated by the MVP RAD.

For example: 


```wl
PROCEDURE WIN_Table_MyExampleFile(...
	gclPresenter is PTableMyExampleFile dynamic <presenter>=Null)
```


When this attribute is used, the call to the "Request for refreshing the display" event of the window (or page) will be triggered by:

- any call to [RequestUpdateUI](../WDLang1/1000021378.md) from a class declared as &lt;presenter&gt;, 

- any call from any class associated with the &lt;presenter&gt; class. 




For more details, see [MVP RAD: "Presenter" attribute](../Editeurs/1000021508.md).
