## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000159"></a>
The management of exceptions can be customized by process.

You can choose to use an automatic exception process or opt for an advanced exception management via the different WLanguage functions.

**Important**: The automatic management of errors and exceptions operates for the process for which it was defined. To use a global and unique process if an exception occurs, you must use the [mechanism of general exceptions](../WDLang1/3034001.md).

### Implementing the automatic management of exceptions
<a name="implementing_the_automatic_management_exceptions_ELTPARAGRAPHE000042"></a>

To implement the automatic management of exceptions: 

1. In the code editor, display the process where the exceptions must be managed: initialization code, click code, procedure, etc.

2. In the code header, click "When exception: by program".

3. The window that is displayed allows you to specify the type of automatic process to perform:

[ExceptionChangeParameter](../WDLang1/3034007.md) can be used for advanced error management.

### Running the error process ("CASE EXCEPTION:" in the code)
<a name="running_the_error_process_case_exception_the_code_ELTPARAGRAPHE000059"></a>

If this option is selected, a line of code is added into "CASE EXCEPTION:". The code lines following this statement will be run when an exception occurs in the previous code lines (or in a process called by these code lines).

For example:


```wl
CASE EXCEPTION:
// Display an error message
Error("A fatal error was detected.", ExceptionInfo(), "", "Stop the procedure.")
// Manage this error
...
```
This option is recommended to group all the exception processes that may occur.

### Running a procedure of exception process:
<a name="running_procedure_exception_process_ELTPARAGRAPHE000071"></a>

If this option is selected, the specified procedure will be automatically run to process the error when an exception occurs in the current process (or in the processes called by the current process). This option is recommended if a procedure used to process the exceptions is already found in your application. This procedure will be automatically called when an exception occurs. No test to run.

This procedure can return one of the constants found in the table below.

Depending on the constant returned, WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile will perform the corresponding process.


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| ***opCancel*** | Restarts the exception |
| ***opEndProcess*** | The function that triggered the error returns an error and the current process stops. Equivalent to the [SetFocusAndReturnToUserInput](../WDLang1/1410088107.md) function. |
| ***opEndProgram*** | The function that triggered the error returns an error and the program stops. Equivalent to the [EndProgram](../WDLang1/3013033.md) function. |
| ***opRelaunchProgram*** | Ends the application and automatically restarts the application.<br><br><br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This constant is not available. |

|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [ExceptionChangeParameter](../WDLang1/3034007.md) | Configures the automatic behavior that will be implemented if an exception occurs in the current process. |
| [ExceptionDisplay](../WDLang1/1000019408.md) | Displays the standard window of exceptions with the content of the current exception. |
| [ExceptionEnable](../WDLang1/3034002.md) | Re-enables the current exception process if the exception was corrected. |
| [ExceptionInfo](../WDLang1/3034006.md) | Retrieves information about the current exception. |
| [ExceptionPropagate](../WDLang1/3034014.md) | Propagates an exception. |
| [ExceptionRestoreParameter](../WDLang1/3034008.md) | Restores the exception process of a process. |
| [ExceptionThrow](../WDLang1/3034005.md) | Artificially triggers the security mechanism of WLanguage by throwing an exception. |
