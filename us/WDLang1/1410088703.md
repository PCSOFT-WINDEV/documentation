## Remarks


### "Request for refreshing the display" event
<a name="request_for_refreshing_the_display_event_ELTPARAGRAPHE000069"></a>

The "Request for refreshing the display" event contains the code for refreshing the controls of a given element: contents of controls, state (visible, grayed out...), text to refresh, etc, ... This event is available on windows, internal windows, pages, internal pages, control templates and supercontrols.

This event can receive parameters. Simply declare a procedure in the event. For example: 


```wl
// Request for refreshing the display
PROCEDURE AskForRefresh(RefreshType is Boolean)
```


This event is started upon request by the following functions: 

- [RequestRefreshUI](../WDLang1/1000023899.md): Executes the "Request for refreshing the display" event at the end of the current process (asynchronous execution). 

- [ExecuteRefreshUI](../WDLang1/1000023901.md): Immediately executes the "Request for refreshing the display" event. 

- **RequestRefreshUIElement**: Executes the "Request for refreshing the display" event of the given element at the end of the current process (asynchronous execution).

- [ExecuteRefreshUIElement](../WDLang1/1410088704.md): Immediately executes the "Request for refreshing the display" event of the given element. 

- [RequestRefreshUIParent](../WDLang1/1000023900.md): Executes the "Request for refreshing the display" event of the higher level at the end of the current process (asynchronous execution).

- [ExecuteRefreshUIParent](../WDLang1/1000023902.md): Immediately executes the "Request for refreshing the display" event of the higher level.


When these functions are called, you can specify the value of the parameters expected by "Request for refreshing the display".

### "Presenter" attribute
<a name="presenter_attribute_ELTPARAGRAPHE000132"></a>

The **presenter** attribute is used to associate a class of the presenter layer with a view (window, page or report). 

This attribute is mainly used in the global declaration of the windows generated by the MVP RAD in WINDEV. 

For example: 


```wl
PROCEDURE WIN_Table_MyExampleFile(...
	gclPresenter is PTableMyExampleFile dynamic<presenter>=Null)
```


With this attribute, the "Request for refreshing the display" window event will be triggered by:

- any call to **RequestRefreshUIElement** from a class declared as &lt;presenter&gt;,

- any call from any class associated with the &lt;presenter&gt; class. 




For more details, see [MVP RAD: "Presenter" attribute](../Editeurs/1000021508.md).
