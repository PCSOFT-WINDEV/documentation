Finds the position of a specified string within another string (or Buffer).

You can also find the position of one of the strings in an array.

## Example


```wl
n is int
MyString is string = "What a wonderful World"
n = Position(MyString, "won", 1, FromBeginning)
// Returns 8 (position of "w" in "wonderful")
n = Position(MyString, "XXX")
// Returns 0 (no "XXX" found in the string)
n = Position(MyString, "l", 0, FromEnd)
// Returns 21 (position of "l" in "World")
n = Position(MyString, "e", 11)
// Returns 12 (position of "e" in "wonderful")
n = Position(MyString, "o", Length(MyString), FromEnd)
// Returns 19 (position of "o" in "World")
n = Position(MyString, "o", n-1, FromEnd)
// Returns 9 (position of "o" in "wonderful")
n = Position(MyString, "o", n-1, FromEnd)
// Returns 0 (there is no other "o")
```


<a name="Example2"></a>



```wl
n is int
MyString2 is string = "http://Server/File.html"
n = Position(MyString2,["/","//"])	
// Returns 6
n = Position(MyString2,["/","//"], 8)
// Returns 15

## Syntax

### Finding the position of a specified string within another string

`<Result> = Position(<Initial string> , <Search string> [, <Start position> [, <Option>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**



- Position of the first character of the search string within the initial string,

- 0 if the search string is not found. 
	This position is relative to the beginning of the string.




**`<Initial string>: (Character string)`**

Character string where the search will be performed (maximum size: 2 GB).

**`<Search string>: (Character string)`**

String to be searched in the initial string.

**`<Start position>: (Optional integer)`**

Index of the character from which the search will be started. By default, the search starts from the first character (character 1). 
To start the search from the end of the string (*FromEnd* constant), this parameter must correspond to 0 or to the length of the string. 
If this parameter is negative, the search starts from the first character. 
If the value of this parameter is greater than the number of characters in &lt;Initial string&gt;, &lt;Result&gt; is equal to 0.

**`<Option>: (Optional constant (or combination of constants))`**

Indicates the search direction and the characteristics of the search:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *FromBeginning*<br>(Default value) | Searches from the first to the last character of the string. |
| *FromEnd* | Searches from the last to the first character of the string. |
| *IgnoreCase* | Case and accent insensitive search (ignores uppercase/lowercase differences).<br><br>![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) This option has no effect. |
| *WholeWord* | Searches for a whole word, i.e., between punctuation characters or spaces.<br><br>![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) This option has no effect. |

### Finding a string in an array of strings

`(<Result>, <Index>) = Position(<Initial string> , <Array of search strings> [, <Start position> [, <Option>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**



- Position of the first character of the first string of the array found in the initial string. 
	This position is relative to the beginning of the string.

- 0 if none of the search strings were found. 




**`<Index>: (Integer)`**

Index of the string in the array.

**`<Initial string>: (Character string)`**

Character string where the search will be performed (maximum size: 2 GB).

**`<Array of search strings>: (Array)`**

Array containing the strings to find in the initial string.

**`<Start position>: (Optional integer)`**

Index of the character from which the search will be started. By default, the search starts from the first character (character 1). To start the search from the end of the string, this parameter must correspond to 0 or to the length of the string. 
If this parameter is negative, the search starts from the first character. 
If the value of this parameter is greater than the number of characters in &lt;Initial string&gt;, &lt;Result&gt; is equal to 0.

**`<Option>: (Optional constant (or combination of constants))`**

Indicates the search direction and the characteristics of the search:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *FromBeginning*<br>(Default value) | Searches from the first to the last character of the string. |
| *FromEnd* | Searches from the last to the first character of the string. |
| *IgnoreCase* | Case and accent insensitive search (ignores uppercase/lowercase differences).<br><br>![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) This option has no effect. |
| *WholeWord* | Searches for a whole word, i.e., between punctuation characters or spaces.<br><br>![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) This option has no effect. |

## Remarks


### Finding a character string
<a name="finding_character_string_ELTPARAGRAPHE000178"></a>

By default, the search is case-sensitive: the search string must have the same case as the substring to find in the string. To perform a case-insensitive search, use the *IgnoreCase* constant.

The positions in a character string are always given from the beginning of the string, regardless the search direction.

To associate **Position** with the *FromEnd* constant, it is necessary to start at the position calculated by Length(&lt;Initial string&gt;). For example:


```wl
Position(MyString, "\", Length(MyString), FromEnd)
```


The following syntax can also be used. In this case, the parameter 0 allows the function to select the best start position.


```wl
Position(MyString, "\", 0, FromEnd)
```

<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>




### Unicode/Ansi
<a name="unicodeansi_ELTPARAGRAPHE000198"></a>

**Position** allows you to find the position of a string in a Unicode or Ansi string.

Ansi and/or Unicode strings can be used in &lt;Initial string&gt; and &lt;Search string&gt; (you can use a Unicode parameter and an Ansi parameter).

The conversion rule used is as follows:

- If at least one of the strings is a Unicode string, all strings are converted to Unicode and the operation is performed in this standard.

- Otherwise, the operation is performed in Ansi.

### Characters taken into account for punctuation and spaces
<a name="characters_taken_into_account_for_punctuation_and_spaces_ELTPARAGRAPHE000362"></a>The characters taken into account for punctuation and spaces are provided by the system. To get the list of these characters, write the following WLanguage code:

```wl
s is string
FOR i = 0 TO 255
	IF Charact(i) <> StringFormat(Charact(i), ccIgnorePunctuationAndSpace) THEN
		 s += Charact(i)
	END
END

### Miscellaneous
<a name="miscellaneous_ELTPARAGRAPHE000219"></a>

[PositionOccurrence](../WDLang1/3024029.md) is used to find the position of the Nth occurrence of a substring by searching from the beginning or from the end of the string.
