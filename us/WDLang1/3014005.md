Runs a function found in an external DLL. This function can be a function of Windows API. The functions accessible by **API** are the functions of the standard libraries of Windows (USER32, KERNEL32, GDI32, etc.). 

The function can be identified by: 

- its name. 

- its number.

- its address.




It is also possible to use a variable of type [API description](../WDLang1/1000019149.md). For APIs that use parameters of specific types or that are called multiple times in the same application, it is recommended to use an API Description variable directly (without using the **API** function).  

**Remarks**:

- This function is equivalent to [CallDLL32](../WDLang1/3014003.md).

- If the function to run contains QWORD parameters, you must use an [API description](../WDLang1/1000019149.md) variable (Syntax 4).

<a name="NOTE0_1"></a>

## Remarks




### Checks performed
<a name="checks_performed_ELTPARAGRAPHE000153"></a>

- **API** is protected against "General Protection Faults" in the function called. Nevertheless, a WLanguage error is triggered if this type of error occurs.

- For the functions following the PASCAL call prototype (especially the functions of the Windows API), a simple check on the number of parameters passed to the function is performed. A WLanguage error occurs in case of discrepancy.



<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>




### Managing the errors
<a name="managing_the_errors_ELTPARAGRAPHE000164"></a>

When running functions of the Windows API, if the result returned corresponds to an error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) (associated with the *errSystemCode* or *errSystemMessage* constant) to find out the error details.
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>




### Loading and unloading the DLL
<a name="loading_and_unloading_the_dll_ELTPARAGRAPHE000175"></a>

**API** automatically loads the DLL if necessary, then it unloads it (if it was loaded). This mechanism can be quite slow, except for the system DLLs (KERNEL, USER, GDI).

To optimize the execution speed, we advise you to load the DLL once with [LoadDLL](../WDLang1/3014006.md) and to unload it with [FreeDLL](../WDLang1/3014009.md) when it is no longer used.
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>




### Parameters that will be passed to the function of DLL
<a name="parameters_that_will_passed_the_function_dll_ELTPARAGRAPHE000193"></a>

These parameters must have the same type as the parameters expected by the function.

The available types are as follows:

- **The "simple" types** (integer, real and boolean). Using another WLanguage type triggers a WLanguage error. 
	If the function to run expects a pointer or a Windows handle, use a [system integer](../Motscles/1514049.md). 
	If the function to run expects an address, use [the & operator](../Motscles/1512002.md).

- The "string" types. 

- The structure types.

- **A name of WLanguage procedure**. This procedure will be called by the function of the DLL (see the paragraph below). 
	The parameters depend on the function run. See the documentation about this function for more details.



<a name="NOTE0_5"></a>




### Passing a string to an API or retrieving a string from an API
<a name="passing_string_api_retrieving_string_from_api_ELTPARAGRAPHE000220"></a>

1. In input parameter, use the string type. 
	For example:
	
	```txt
	sString is string 
	API(<DLL>, <Function>, sString)
	```


2. In output parameter, the C language cannot easily manage the dynamic strings. Therefore, you must:

	- define a maximum size, with the "String on" type. 
			For example:
			
		```txt
		sString is string on 100
		API(<DLL>, <Function>, sString)
		// in Method in C: 
		// STRNCPY(PointerInC, "Test", 100)
		```


	- retrieve the addresses of strings in C (however, in this case, the code section in C must "preserve" the strings returned), then transfer the string into a string variable with [StringRetrieve](../WDLang1/3024005.md). 
			For example:
			
		```txt
		nStringAddress is system int
		API(<DLL>, <Function>, &nStringAddress)
		sString is string
		sString = StringRetrieve(nStringAddress, srASCIIZAddress)
		// in Method in C: *PointerInC = "Test"
		```





3. In return value, retrieve the addresses of strings in C (however, in this case, the code section in C must "preserve" the strings returned), then transfer the string into a string variable with [StringRetrieve](../WDLang1/3024005.md).  
	For example: 
	
	```txt
	nStringAddress is system int
	nStringAddress = API(<DLL>, <Function>)
	sString is string
	sString = StringRetrieve(nStringAddress, srASCIIZAddress)
	// in Method in C: Return PointerInC
	```




<a name="NOTE0_6"></a>




### Passing a structure to an API
<a name="passing_structure_api_ELTPARAGRAPHE000255"></a>

The structures can be directly passed as parameter to the APIs, without going via their address. To do so, the members of the structure must be passed in parameter one by one.

**Limit**: All the members of the structure must be aligned on 4 bytes.
<a name="NOTE0_7"></a>




### Passing a structure containing a string to an API
<a name="passing_structure_containing_string_api_ELTPARAGRAPHE000265"></a>

1. In input, the following code must be used: 
	
	```txt
	Struct is structure
		sString is string
	END
	AStruct is Struct
	API(<DLL>, <Function>, &AStruct)
	```


2. In output, the C language does not easily manage the dynamic strings. Therefore, you must:

	- define a maximum size and perform a copy into the WLanguage memory. 
			For example: 
			
		```txt
		sString is string on 100
		Struct is structure
			aString is int
		END
		AStruct is Struct
		AStruct:aString = &sString
		API(<DLL>, <Function>, &AStruct) 
		// in Method in C: 
		// STRNCPY(CStruct->PointerInC, "Test", 100)
		```


	- retrieve the address of strings in C (however, in this case, the code section in C must "preserve " the strings returned). 
			For example: 
			
		```txt
		sString is string
		Struct is structure
			aString is int
		END
		AStruct is Struct
		API(<DLL>, <Function>, &AStruct)
		sString = StringRetrieve(AStruct:aString, srASCIIZAddress)
		// in Method in C: StructInC->PointerInC = "Test"
		```







<a name="NOTE0_8"></a>




### Procedure called in CallBack 
<a name="procedure_called_callback_ELTPARAGRAPHE000287"></a>

Some functions of the Windows API expect the address of a "CallBack" procedure as parameter: this procedure will be called back by the function of the API.

For example: the EnumWindows API is used to list all the Windows windows opened on a computer. This function expects the address of a procedure as parameter: this procedure will be called whenever a window is found.

**Remark**: The CallBack procedures can be used in 32 bits and in 64 bits. 

**To use a callback procedure in WLanguage:**

**1.** Create the callback procedure in your project
To retrieve the parameters, you must exactly describe the parameters expected by the "CallBack" function. Otherwise, "general protection faults" may occur.

```txt
PROCEDURE <Procedure name> (<Param1> is <Type1>, ...
		<Param2> is <Type2>)
```


**Remarks**:

- The types must correspond to the ones described in the documentation of the API.

- The call convention of the DLL "CallBack" functions must be "stdcall" or "cdecl". By default, the call convention is considered as being "stdcall". A "cdecl" callback can be declared via the "call convention" attribute. The prototype of the function becomes:
	
	```txt
	PROCEDURE <Procedure name> (<Param1> is <Type1>, ...
			<Param2> is <Type2>) <call convention=CDECL>
	```


- The parameters must necessarily be passed by value. To retrieve a parameter by reference:

	1. Use an integer.

	2. With [Transfer](../WDLang1/3014015.md), retrieve or assign the real value.







**2.** Modify the call to the function accordingly. Use the following syntax:

```txt
API(<DLL name>, <Function name>, <Name of callback procedure>)
```


See the full example for more details.
<a name="NOTE0_9"></a>


### Miscellaneous
<a name="miscellaneous_ELTPARAGRAPHE000330"></a>

- **API** and [CallDLL32](../WDLang1/3014003.md) do not lock the other threads.

- If the API function called modifies the system regional settings, the previous regional settings are restored.




[APIParameter](../WDLang1/3014026.md) is used to configure the default behavior of these functions.

**Remark**: Up to version 100045:

- **API** and [CallDLL32](../WDLang1/3014003.md) lock the other threads.

- If the API function called modifies the system regional settings (languages, decimal places, etc.), the previous regional settings are not restored.
