| Constant | Description | Used by the functions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **DestructionWithoutModification** | By default, an event is automatically modified during its destruction. If the event is created with this constant, it will not be modified during the call to EventDestroy or during the automatic destruction of the event when closing the application. | [EventCreate](../WDLang1/3077009.md) |
| **Infinite** | Endless wait | [ThreadWait](../WDLang1/3077020.md), [ThreadStop](../WDLang1/3077019.md), <br>[ThreadWaitSignal](../WDLang1/3077022.md), [SemaphoreStart](../WDLang1/3077008.md)<br>[MutexStart](../WDLang1/1000019023.md) |
| **shareNone** | The event, the semaphore or the mutex is specific to the application. If [EventDestroy](../WDLang1/3077025.md), [SemaphoreDestroy](../WDLang1/3077011.md) or [MutexDestroy](../WDLang1/1000019025.md) are not called, the event, semaphore or mutex is destroyed at the end of the application. | [SemaphoreCreate](../WDLang1/3077012.md), [EventCreate](../WDLang1/3077009.md), <br>[MutexCreate](../WDLang1/1000019022.md) |
| **shareGlobal** | The event, the semaphore or the mutex is shared among all the applications found on the computer. | [SemaphoreCreate](../WDLang1/3077012.md), [EventCreate](../WDLang1/3077009.md), <br>[MutexCreate](../WDLang1/1000019022.md) |
| **shareUser** | The event, the semaphore or the mutex is shared among all the applications of the session of the user who runs the application. | [SemaphoreCreate](../WDLang1/3077012.md), [EventCreate](../WDLang1/3077009.md), <br>[MutexCreate](../WDLang1/1000019022.md) |
| **PriorityLow** | Thread with low priority. | [ThreadPriority](../WDLang1/3077027.md) |

| **PriorityNormal** | Thread with normal priority. | [ThreadPriority](../WDLang1/3077027.md) |
| **eventAutomatic** | Once opened, the event is automatically closed when all the threads are unlocked. | [EventCreate](../WDLang1/3077009.md) |
| **eventClose** | The event is closed. | [EventCreate](../WDLang1/3077009.md), [EventChange](../WDLang1/3077017.md) |
| **eventOpen** | The event is opened. | [EventCreate](../WDLang1/3077009.md), [EventChange](../WDLang1/3077017.md) |
| **eventOpenAndClose** | Opens the event, unlocks all the pending threads and closes the event. | [EventChange](../WDLang1/3077017.md) |
| **eventManual** | The event is modified by [EventChange](../WDLang1/3077017.md). | [EventCreate](../WDLang1/3077009.md) |
| **threadStopRequested** | Thread status: A stop request has been made for this thread. | [ThreadState](../WDLang1/3077016.md), <br>[Thread](../WDLang1/1000024879.md) type |
| **threadWaitForStart** | Mode for starting the thread: Waits for the actual start of the thread before continuing the execution. | [ThreadExecute](../WDLang1/3077024.md), <br>[Thread](../WDLang1/1000024879.md) type |
| **threadAuto** | Automatic management of threads. | [ThreadMode](../WDLang1/3077028.md) |
| **threadGlobalContext** | Mode for starting the thread: Forces the use of the global context of the project if the thread is run from a window. <br>The context of the window is used by default. | [ThreadExecute](../WDLang1/3077024.md), <br>[Thread](../WDLang1/1000024879.md) type |
| **threadRunning** | The thread is running. | [ThreadState](../WDLang1/3077016.md), <br>[Thread](../WDLang1/1000024879.md) type |
| **threadUnknown** | The thread was not created or it was destroyed. | [ThreadState](../WDLang1/3077016.md) |
| **threadMonoProcessor** | Forces the application to run on a single processor on the multiprocessor, hyperthread or dual core computers. | [ThreadMode](../WDLang1/3077028.md) |
| **threadMultiProcessor** | Restores the standard use of processors on the multiprocessor, hyperthread or dual core computers. | [ThreadMode](../WDLang1/3077028.md) |
| **threadNotExecuted** | Start the thread in normal mode. | [Thread](../WDLang1/1000024879.md) type |
| **threadNormal** | Start the thread in normal mode. | [ThreadExecute](../WDLang1/3077024.md) |
| **threadMain** | Handles the main thread. | [ThreadStop](../WDLang1/3077019.md), <br>[ThreadSendSignal](../WDLang1/3077021.md), <br>[Thread](../WDLang1/1000024879.md) type |
