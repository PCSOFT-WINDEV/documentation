| [&lt;Diagram variable&gt;.Save](../WDLang1/1410089987.md) | Saves a diagram as a "diag" file. |
| [&lt;Diagram variable&gt;.Search](../WDLang1/1410089986.md) | Searches for shapes containing a specific text in a diagram. |
| [&lt;Diagram variable&gt;.StartModification](../WDLang1/1410088877.md) | Indicates the start of a series of actions performed in a variable of type Diagram in a single event ("undo/redo"). |
| [&lt;Diagram variable&gt;.ToSVG](../WDLang1/1410088880.md) | Exports a diagram to an SVG image. |
| [&lt;diagShape variable&gt;.ToImage](../WDLang1/1410088686.md) | Creates an image from a shape in a diagram (the shape can be displayed or not in the diagram). |
| [<Éditeur de diagrammes>StartModification](../WDLang1/1410088875.md) | Indicates the start of a series of actions performed in a Diagram Editor control in a single event ("undo/redo"). |
