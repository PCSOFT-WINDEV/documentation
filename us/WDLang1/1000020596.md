---

**`<Check Box control>: (Control name)`**

Name of Check Box control from which the option will be deleted.

**`<Index>: (Integer)`**

## Remarks


- When deleting options from a Check Box control, the size of the control is not modified. The control size can be changed using the [Width](../Proprietes/2510059.md) and [Height](../Proprietes/2510050.md) properties.

- You have the ability to compact the options in order to optimize the aspect of the control once options have been deleted. 
	In compacted mode, the options of a Check Box control move closer: 

	- when an option is made invisible. 

	- when an option is deleted.




- To use the compacted mode: 

	- check "Compact invisible options" in the "Details" tab of the control description.

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) use the [CompactOption](../Proprietes/1000020608.md) property.




- When an option is deleted, the indices of the options that follow the deleted option are automatically renumbered.
