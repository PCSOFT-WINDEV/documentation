| Constant | Details | Type of variable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **diagActionNone** | Actions available on a shape: No actions available to the end user.  | [diagShape](../WDLang1/1410088082.md) type |
| **diagActionAll** | Actions available on a shape: All actions available to the end user. | [diagShape](../WDLang1/1410088082.md) type |
| **connectorSnapToAuto** | How the connector will snap to the target shape: The connection point is automatically determined according to the position of the connector and the shape. | [diagHead](../WDLang1/1410088470.md) type |
| **connectorSnapToShape** | How the connector will snap to the target shape: The end of the connector will snap to the center of the shape. | [diagHead](../WDLang1/1410088470.md) type |
