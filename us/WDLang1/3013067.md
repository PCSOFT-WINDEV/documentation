## Syntax

### Opening the WINDEV project corresponding to the current application in Reports & Queries

`<Result> = RunReportsAndQueries()`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the project corresponding to the current application opened in Reports & Queries,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) with the *errMessage* constant.

### Opening a report in Reports & Queries

`<Result> = RunReportsAndQueries(<Report to open>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the specified report is opened in Reports & Queries,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) with the *errMessage* constant.




**`<Report to open>: (Character string)`**

Logical name of the report to be opened in Reports & Queries. This report must be modifiable in Reports & Queries ("Modifiable in Reports and Queries" checked in the "Details" tab of the report description).

When **RunReportsAndQueries** is called for the first time, the report file (".WDE" file) is automatically extracted from the application's library and copied to the "Custom reports and queries" directory (defined when creating the WINDEV application setup procedure or installing the WINDEV application). This file will be used by the end users.

On subsequent calls to **RunReportsAndQueries**, the report to be opened will be searched for:

- first, in the directory of "Custom reports and queries".

- then, in the directory of "Shared reports and queries".


These directories have been defined in the setup wizard of the application.
