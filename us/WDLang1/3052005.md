Opens and enables an MDI child window.

**MDIOpen** is also used to:

- define the alias of the window,

- define the title of the window to open,

- pass parameters to the window.




The following events are run when **MDIOpen** is called:

- Running the event "Global declarations" of the window.

- Running the initialization events of the controls (the order is undefined).


The window is then displayed (this window is always a child window of the MDI parent window). This window cannot be moved outside the MDI area of the MDI parent window.

**Remark**: **MDIOpen** only opens the windows defined as "MDI child windows" in the window editor. A MDI child window can be opened only if the MDI parent window exists and if it is opened.

## Example


```wl
// Open the "WIN_CustomerInput" window
// The title of the window is "New customer"
// The Value1 and Value2 parameters are passed 
// to the event "Global declarations" of "WIN_EditCustomer" window 
ResAlias = MDIOpen(WIN_CustomerInput, "Alias New Customer", ...
	"New Customer", Value1, Value2)

## Syntax

`<Result> = MDIOpen(<Window> [, <Alias name> [, <Window title> [, <Parameter 1> [... [, <Parameter N>]]]]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Character string)`**

Alias generated for the window to open. The same window can be opened several times. This alias is used to identify the opened window. This alias can be modified by [WinChangeAlias](../WDLang1/3038028.md).

**`<Window>: (Window name)`**



- Name of the window to be opened.

- Name and full path of the window (".WDW" file) to open.




**`<Alias name>: (Character string)`**

Alias of the window. An alias is automatically generated ("A0001" for example) if this parameter is not specified or if it corresponds to an empty string ("").

**`<Window title>: (Character string)`**

Title of the window to be opened. If this parameter is not specified or if it corresponds to an empty string (""), the window title is the one defined in the editor.

**`<Parameter 1>: (Type of value sent to the window (optional))`**

First parameter that will be passed to the "Global declarations" event of the window to open. This parameter is passed by value and it is considered as being a global variable of the window.
This parameter cannot contain any array variables (the arrays can only be passed by reference).



**`<Parameter N>: (Type of value sent to the window (optional))`**

Nth parameter that must be passed to the "Global declarations" event of the window to open. This parameter is passed by value and it is considered as being a global variable of the window.
This parameter cannot contain any array variables (the arrays can only be passed by reference).

## Remarks


### Parameters passed to the window to open
<a name="parameters_passed_the_window_open_ELTPARAGRAPHE000097"></a>The parameters are retrieved in the event "Global declarations" of the window. The first line of code of this event must correspond to the following line:


```txt
PROCEDURE <Window name> (<Parameter 1> [,<Parameter 2> [, ...]])
```
**These parameters are passed by value and not by reference.**

For more details, see [Window with parameters](../WDChamp/1010026.md).

### Window opening mode
<a name="window_opening_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000123"></a>

The window is opened in non-modal mode:

- The MDI parent window remains the current window.

- Once the MDI child window is opened, the processes following the call to **MDIOpen** are executed.

- The user will be able to click in the parent window of the opened window.

### Number of opened windows
<a name="number_opened_windows_ELTPARAGRAPHE000138"></a>

The number of windows that can be opened simultaneously depends on the available memory.
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Closing a window
<a name="closing_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000147"></a>

A window opened with **MDIOpen** can be closed with [Close](../WDLang1/3038018.md) (without parameters) from any event associated with the window or a control in the window.

If an MDI parent window is closed, its MDI child windows are also closed.
<a name="NOTE0_5"></a>


### Minimized window
<a name="minimized_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000163"></a>

If the MDI child window is minimized, only this window is minimized.

The displayed icon is:

- the one of the minimized window if the current window has an icon,

- the one of the current project if the current window has no icon.
