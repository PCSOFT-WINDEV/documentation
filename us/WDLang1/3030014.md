## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000123"></a>
The Drag and Drop from the explorer consists in selecting one or more files in the Windows explorer and in transferring them into a control of a WINDEV window.

For example, the "WD Drag and Drop" example is used to display the image files "dropped" from the explorer.

## Principle
<a name="principle_ELTTEXTE000147"></a>
To allow Drag and Drop to be performed from the explorer to a WINDEV application, the different steps are as follows:

1. Enable the ability to perform a Drag and Drop from the explorer ([ExplorerAccept](../WDLang1/3030015.md)).

2. To process the action performed by the user, associate a WLanguage procedure with the drop of the file in the window ([Event](../WDLang1/3015011.md)).

3. In the procedure called whenever a file is dropped in the window, retrieve the characteristics of the "dropped" file with [ExplorerRetrieve](../WDLang1/3030009.md).

## Functions specific to the Drag and Drop from the explorer
<a name="functions_specific_the_drag_and_drop_from_the_explorer_ELTTEXTE000171"></a>
The following functions are used to manage Drag and Drop from the Windows explorer to a window of a WINDEV application.



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [ExplorerAccept](../WDLang1/3030015.md) | Enables or disables the ability to perform "Drag and Drop" from the Windows explorer to a WINDEV window or control. |
| [ExplorerRetrieve](../WDLang1/3030009.md) | Retrieves the number and the name of the files "dropped" from the explorer. |

### Enabling the management of Drag and Drop from the explorer to the window
<a name="enabling_the_management_drag_and_drop_from_the_explorer_the_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000050"></a>

To enable the ability to perform Drag and Drop from the explorer to a window, you must declare in the initialization code of the window:

- the implementation of Drag and Drop, 

- the event used to link a specific WLanguage procedure (GetFiles in our example) to the drop action (Windows event WM_DROPFILES equal to 563). This procedure is a procedure local to the window.
	
	```wl
	ExplorerAccept(True, "")
	Event("GetFiles", "*.", 563)
	```

### Processing the "dropped" files
<a name="processing_the_dropped_files_ELTPARAGRAPHE000062"></a>

**In the procedure called whenever files are "dropped" in the window, you have the ability to get information and to process the relevant files.**

In our example, [ExplorerRetrieve](../WDLang1/3030009.md) allows you to:

- find out the number of files "dropped" from the explorer, 

- retrieve the name and the path of each file and display it in a new window.





```wl
// Number of files dropped in the application by Drag and Drop
NbFile is int = ExplorerRetrieve(_EVE.wparam)
sFileName is string
// Retrieve all the files
FOR i = 1 TO NbFile
	sFileName = ExplorerRetrieve(_EVE.wparam, i)
	OpenDocument(sFileName)
END
```
