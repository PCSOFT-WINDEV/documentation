## What is Drag and Drop?
<a name="what_drag_and_drop_ELTTEXTE000131"></a>
Drag and Drop is used to transfer data between several controls with the mouse. This data can be moved between several controls found in the same application or in different applications.

You must distinguish between:

- The source, object containing the data to copy or to cut.

- The target, object into which the data must be copied.




To perform Drag and Drop:

1. Select the data in the source with the mouse.

2. Press the left mouse button and hold it down while moving data to the destination.

3. Release the mouse button to validate the data transfer.




If data must be copied, the Ctrl key must be held down during the operation.
