Returns and modifies the position of the mouse cursor.

**Remark**: To get the position of the mouse cursor, it is recommended to use [MouseXPos](../WDLang1/3071007.md) and [MouseYPos](../WDLang1/3071008.md).

## Example


```wl
Res is int = CursorPos(cpClient)
IF Res <> -1 THEN
	Message("Position X = " + LoWord(Res) + "Position Y = " + HiWord(Res))
END
```

## Syntax

`<Result> = CursorPos([<Marker>, ] <X Position> , <Y Position>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**

Position of the mouse (the coordinates are returned by [HiWord](../WDLang1/3014017.md) and [LoWord](../WDLang1/3014018.md)).

- Current position if &lt;X Position&gt; and &lt;Y Position&gt; are not specified.

- Previous position if &lt;X Position&gt; and &lt;Y Position&gt; are specified.

- -1 if an error occurs (position of the mouse outside the requested marker for example).




**`<Marker>: (Optional integer constant)`**

Indicates the marker used to calculate the position:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *cpClient* | Mouse position in relation to the client area of the window with focus.<br>Client Area = window without title bar, menu bar and border. |
| *cpScreen*<br>(Default value) | Position of the mouse in relation to the screen. |
| *cpWindow* | Position of the mouse in relation to the window with focus. |



**`<X Position>: (Real)`**

New horizontal position in the selected marker.

**`<Y Position>: (Real)`**

New vertical position in the selected marker.

## Remarks




### Calculating the mouse position
<a name="calculating_the_mouse_position_ELTPARAGRAPHE000073"></a>

To find out the horizontal and vertical position of the mouse from the result, you must use [HiWord](../WDLang1/3014017.md) and [LoWord](../WDLang1/3014018.md).

The low byte of &lt;Result&gt; is used to get the horizontal position (X) of the mouse.

The high byte of &lt;Result&gt; is used to get the vertical position (Y) of the mouse. If an error occurs, X and Y are equal to -1.

The coordinates are relative to the top left corner of the selected marker.

### Miscellaneous
<a name="miscellaneous_ELTPARAGRAPHE000093"></a>

- [MouseXPos](../WDLang1/3071007.md) and [MouseYPos](../WDLang1/3071008.md) respectively return the horizontal and vertical positions of the mouse in relation to the control where a left mouse click was performed.

- You can, for example, calculate the position of the mouse cursor in a timer in order to always display this position on the screen.
