The User Macro-Codes are sections of WLanguage code allowing the end user to customize his application.

A wizard helps you type this code.

### Starting the wizard for UMC management
<a name="starting_the_wizard_for_umc_management_ELTPARAGRAPHE000020"></a>

If the window allows you to enter a User Macro-Code, the ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=MCU_Icone.gif) icon is displayed: 

- until Windows XP:  beside the minimize button of window. 

- from Windows Vista: below the title bar. 


When this icon is clicked, a wizard is displayed, allowing the end user to create and use his own user macro-codes.

**Remark**: 

- To start the UMC, you also have the ability to press Windows + F2.

- The wizard can also be started via a custom button. To customize the UMC button, create a new button associated with the preset action "Open the edit window of User Macro-Code (UMC)". In this case, the default button will not be displayed anymore. The new button can be positioned anywhere in the window.

<a name="adding_user_macrocode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000039"></a>

To add a User Macro-Code:

1. Start the wizard for UMC management (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=MCU_Icone.gif) icon by default). 

2. Click the "Add a User Macro-Code" button.

3. Specify the type of action affected by the custom process: Action on a control or on a key combination.

4. If you want to perform a process on a control:

	- Select the relevant control. A table lists the controls found in the application as well as their caption. You also have the ability to directly select the control in the window via the "Choose the control" button.

	- Select the action to customize and the execution time of the custom action.

	- A simplified code editor is displayed, allowing you to enter the title of the macro and the WLanguage code of the User Macro-Code.




5. If you want to perform a process on a key combination:

	- Specify the relevant key combination.  

	- A simplified code editor is displayed, allowing you to enter the title of the macro, the execution time and the WLanguage code of the User Macro-Code. 




6. In the simplified code editor:

	- The syntactic coloring is available.

	- The help for the WLanguage functions is available.

	- The test of the code entered can be run directly.

	- You have the ability to display the list of controls in order to handle another window control.




7. Validate. The macro-code is added and it is immediately available.

<a name="sending_the_user_macrocodes_email_ELTPARAGRAPHE000068"></a>

The created User Macro-Codes can be emailed if this feature was allowed by the developer of the application.

To send the User Macro-Codes by email:

1. Start the wizard.

2. Click the "Send the code" button.




**Caution**: this feature is not available for the applications installed with an automatic update from a network directory. In this case, the UMC files are copied into the shared network directory.

## Limitations
<a name="limitations_ELTTEXTE000225"></a>


### Code entered in the User Macro-Codes
<a name="code_entered_the_user_macrocodes_ELTPARAGRAPHE000084"></a>

- The exception processes (When Exception ...) have no effect in UMC.

- Therefore, you cannot use the HFSQL functions for modifying data files ([HAdd](../WDLang4/3044147.md), [HCreation](../WDLang4/3044255.md), [HCreationIfNotFound](../WDLang4/3044254.md), [HWrite](../WDLang4/3044092.md), [HFree](../WDLang4/3044064.md), [HModify](../WDLang4/3044042.md), [HCross](../WDLang4/3044121.md) and [HDelete](../WDLang4/3044018.md)). Moreover, the corresponding functions starting with Table\* are not allowed.

- [Compile](../WDLang1/3013015.md) cannot be used.

- When configuring the application, you have the ability to forbid the use of functions for browsing the data files.

- [SetFocusAndReturnToUserInput](../WDLang1/1410088107.md) can have an unexpected behavior.
