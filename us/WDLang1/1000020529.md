Displays a custom error message in a system error window for a set amount of time. After the timeout, the system window is automatically closed. 

Remarks: 

- **This warning window blocks the application until the time limit has elapsed**. To continue running the application, the user must click "OK". 
	![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) To avoid blocking the application, use [ErrorWithTimeoutAsynchronous](../WDLang1/1000025428.md).

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) WINDEV allows you to apply the skin template of your project to this dialog box. For more details, see [Customizing dialog boxes](../WDLang1/3021003.md).

### Displaying a custom error message

`ErrorWithTimeout(<Timeout> , <Text> [, <Line 2> [... [, <Line n>]]])`
---

**`<Timeout>: (Integer ou Duration)`**

Amount of time (expressed in hundredth of second) before automatically closing the error window. This parameter can be: 

- an integer corresponding to the number of hundredths of a second,

- a Duration variable,

- the duration in a readable format (e.g., 1 s or 10 ms). 




**`<Text>: (Character string)`**

Text to display.

**`<Line 2>: (Optional character string)`**

Text displayed on the second line.



**`<Line n>: (Optional character string)`**

Text displayed on the Nth line.

### Displaying the error message of the last WLanguage function used

`ErrorWithTimeout(<Timeout before closing>)`
---

**`<Timeout before closing>: (Integer ou Duration)`**

Amount of time (expressed in hundredth of second) before automatically closing the error window. This parameter can be: 

- an integer corresponding to the number of hundredths of a second,

- a Duration variable,

- the duration in a readable format (e.g., 1 s or 10 ms).

## Remarks




### Features of the dialog box
<a name="features_the_dialog_box_ELTPARAGRAPHE000089"></a>

- The title of the dialog box is the title of the current window. To modify this title, use [NextTitle](../WDLang1/3038043.md).

- The message is aligned to the left.

- The button caption depends on the runtime language of Windows.

- The maximum number of characters cannot exceed 4096. If a larger string is passed as parameter, it will be truncated.

- The icon displayed (white cross) cannot be modified.




**To customize this dialog box** (and all the system dialog boxes in your application), check "Customize system windows (Info, YesNo, Confirm, Dialog)" in the "Style" tab of the project description. For more details, see [Customizing dialog boxes](../WDLang1/3021003.md).

### Line break in the dialog box
<a name="line_break_the_dialog_box_ELTPARAGRAPHE000113"></a>

The CR string (Carriage Return) can be used to force a break to the next line. For example: 

```wl
ErrorWithTimeout(500, "An error was detected while entering the address." + CR + ...
	"Please modify the customer details.")
```

is equivalent to: 

```wl
ErrorWithTimeout(500, "An error has been detected when entering the address." , ...
	"Please modify the customer details.")
```


You also have the ability to use the syntax of multiline strings. For example: 

```wl
ErrorWithTimeout(500,
[
An error was detected while entering the address. 

Please modify the customer details.
])
```

### Displaying the last error message
<a name="displaying_the_last_error_message_ELTPARAGRAPHE000130"></a>

Calling **ErrorWithTimeout** by specifying only the timeout (syntax2), displays the error message of the last WLanguage function that triggered an error.

In this case, the following code: 

```wl
ErrorWithTimeout(500)
```

is equivalent to: 

```wl
ErrorWithTimeout(500, ErrorInfo())
```


**Caution**: **ErrorWithTimeout** must be used immediately after the call to the function that failed. Indeed, calling a WLanguage function may reinitialize and modify the status report of **ErrorWithTimeout**.

### Miscellaneous
<a name="miscellaneous_ELTPARAGRAPHE000155"></a>

- Timers ([TimerSys](../WDLang1/3015006.md)) are not stopped when this function is called.

- Windows events are not stopped when this function is called.

- The caption of the button is displayed in the language used by Windows on the current computer.

- Equivalence: **ErrorWithTimeout** is equivalent to [Error](../WDLang1/3021013.md) used with [DelayBeforeClosing](../WDLang1/3038040.md): 
	The following code: 
	
	```wl
	ErrorWithTimeout(1000, "An error was detected")
	```

	is equivalent to: 
	
	```wl
	DelayBeforeClosing(1000)
	Error("An error occurred")
	```
