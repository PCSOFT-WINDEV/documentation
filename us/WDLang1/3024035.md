Decrypts a character string that was encrypted by [Encrypt](../WDLang1/3024014.md).

**Remark**: If the encryption and the decryption are performed on different platforms (encryption in Android and decryption in Windows for example), use [EncryptStandard](../WDLang1/1000021293.md) and [DecryptStandard](../WDLang1/1000021294.md). For more details, refer to the "Remarks" paragraph.

## Example

```wl
// Encrypt a string
ResEncrypt = Encrypt("The number of my bank account in Switzerland is 74538290", "Password")
...
// Decrypt the string
Res = Decrypt(ResEncrypt, "Password")
```



```wl
// Decode the data encoded in base 64 
bufDecode is Buffer = Decrypt(bufBase64, "", crypteNone, encodeBASE64)

## Syntax

`<Result> = Decrypt(<Encrypted string> , <Password> [, <Type of encryption used> [, <Format of encrypted string>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Character string)`**



- Decrypted character string,

- Empty string ("") if an error occurred. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md).




**`<Encrypted string>: (Character string)`**

Encrypted character string. This character string was encrypted by [Encrypt](../WDLang1/3024014.md).

**`<Password>: (Character string)`**

Password used to decrypt the character string. This password must be identical to the password that was used to encrypt the character string. A long password provides better encryption security.

**`<Type of encryption used>: (Optional constant (or combination of constants))`**

Specifies the type of encryption and compression performed. This parameter must be identical to the one specified during the encryption.

- Type of encryption: 
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *cryptAnsi* | **This constant can only be used in WINDEV Mobile for Windows CE.**<br><br>The encryption is identical to the one performed in a WINDEV or WEBDEV application. <br>Useful for the applications that encrypt in WINDEV Mobile and that decrypt in WINDEV for example.<br>To use this constant, &lt;Format of encrypted string&gt; must be set to <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>.<br><br>![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png)![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png)![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png)![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This constant has no effect. |
| *cryptFast*<br>(Default value) | Priority was given to the encryption speed (algorithm on 128 bits).<br><br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) The algorithm used will be a Blowfish algorithm.<br><br><br><br> |
| *cryptNone* | No encryption was performed. |
| *cryptRC516* | Priority was given to the encryption security (RC5 algorithm on 16 rounds).<br><br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This constant has no effect. |
| *cryptSecure* | Priority was given to the encryption security (RC5 algorithm on 128 bits).<br><br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) The algorithm used will be a PBE algorithm (Password Based Encryption).<br><br> |



- Type of Compression: 
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *compressLZW* | The string is compressed before it is encrypted.<br><br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This constant has no effect. |
| *compressNone*<br>(Default value) | No compression is performed.<br><br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This constant has no effect. |
| *compressShortString* | The string is compressed via an algorithm optimized for the short character strings. This compression will be effective only if the *cryptNone* constant is selected and if &lt;Format of encrypted string&gt; corresponds to the *encodeNone* constant.<br><br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This constant has no effect. |






**`<Format of encrypted string>: (Optional Integer constant)`**

Indicates the format of the encrypted string. This parameter must be identical to the one specified during the encryption.


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *encodeBASE64* | BASE 64 format. The encrypted file contains printable characters only.<br>To decode a buffer in base 64, you also have the ability to use [Decode](../WDLang1/1000022259.md) associated with the *encodeBASE64* constant. |
| *encodeNone* or <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> | Binary format. The encrypted file may contain non-printable characters. |
| *encodePCS* or <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u><br>(Default value) | ASCII format. The encrypted file contains printable characters only. |
| *encodeUUEncode* | UUEncode format. The encrypted file contains printable characters only. |

![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This parameter is ignored.

## Remarks




### Encrypting and decrypting an external file
<a name="encrypting_and_decrypting_external_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000238"></a>

To encrypt/decrypt an external file, use [fEncrypt](../WDLang1/3036013.md) and [fDecrypt](../WDLang1/3036018.md).
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>




### Decrypting a stream in base64binary format
<a name="decrypting_stream_base64binary_format_ELTPARAGRAPHE000252"></a>

To decrypt a string encrypted in base64, you must use:


```wl
ResultString = Decrypt(EncryptedString, "", cryptNone, encodeBASE64)
// or
ResultString = Decrypt(EncryptedString, encodeBASE64)
```

![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) 

### Encryption in Android/Java and decryption by a WINDEV application (or conversely)
<a name="encryption_androidjava_and_decryption_windev_application_conversely_ELTPARAGRAPHE000278"></a>

Caution: the encryption/decryption algorithms used in Java and Android differ from the ones used by WINDEV. Therefore, you cannot encrypt a character string in Java or Android and decrypt it with WINDEV (and conversely).

To encrypt a character string in Java or Android and to decrypt it with WINDEV (or conversely), use [EncryptStandard](../WDLang1/1000021293.md) and [DecryptStandard](../WDLang1/1000021294.md).
