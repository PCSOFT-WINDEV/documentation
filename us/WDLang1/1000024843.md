## Example


```wl
// There is a traffic light in North Phoenix, at 4725 E. Mayo Blvd.
// It is red
StopLight is TrafficLight
StopLight.Address = "4725 E. Mayo Blvd., Phoenix, AZ"
StopLight.Status = DarkRed
	
// Another traffic light must be set at 5599 on the same boulevard
	
// If the object is simply copied...
CopyLight is dynamic TrafficLight = StopLight
CopyLight.Address = "5599 E. Mayo Blvd., Phoenix, AZ"
// The address of StopLight has also changed...!
	
// If the object is cloned...
CloneLight is dynamic TrafficLight = Clone(StopLight)
// CloneLight contains the same information as StopLight
// But if one of it properties is modified, it does not affect the original traffic light
	
// Change the address
CloneLight.Address = "5599 E. Mayo Blvd., Phoenix, AZ"
// >> StopLight.Address = "4725 E. Mayo Blvd., Phoenix, AZ"

CloneLight.Status = DarkRed
// >> StopLight.Status = DarkGreen

`<Result> = Clone(<Source>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Character string)`**

Instance of the copied class. 

**`<Source>: (Character string)`**

Instance of the class to be copied.

## Remarks


### Operating mode
<a name="operating_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000035"></a>

When **Clone** is used: 

- a new instance of the same class as the original instance is allocated and the constructor is executed by default (without any parameter or optional parameters).

- a member-by-member copy is performed from the original instance to the new instance.




Remark: The copy takes into account the &lt;Copy&gt; attribute of each member: 

- &lt;Copy=False&gt; to ignore a member,

- &lt;Copy=Clone&gt; to clone (deep copy). 





### Variable copy rules
<a name="variable_copy_rules_ELTPARAGRAPHE000050"></a>



| Type of variables | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Simple types (integer, real, string, etc.) | The value of the variable is copied. |
| Arrays | The destination array is a reference to the source array. |
| Associative arrays | The content of the array is copied. |
| Queue | The content of the queue is copied. |
| Stack | The content of the stack is copied. |
| List | The content of the list is copied. |
| Object = Dynamic object | The members of the dynamic object are copied to the members of the object. |
| Object = Object | The members of the source object are copied to the members of the destination object. |
| Dynamic object = Dynamic object | The destination dynamic object is a reference to the source dynamic object. |
| Dynamic object = Object | The destination dynamic object is a reference to the source object. |
| Structure = Dynamic structure | A copy of the structure is performed. Members with the same name are initialized with the existing values. Non-existing members are ignored. |
| Structure = Structure | A copy of the structure is performed. Members with the same name are initialized with the existing values. Non-existing members are ignored. |
| Dynamic structure = Dynamic structure | The destination dynamic structure is a reference to the source dynamic structure. |
| Dynamic structure = Structure | The destination dynamic structure is a reference to the source structure. |
| Advanced type = Advanced type | The advanced type variable is copied. Properties of the same name are initialized with the existing values. |
| Advanced type = Dynamic advanced type | The advanced type variable is copied. Properties of the same name are initialized with the existing values. |
| Dynamic advanced type = Advanced type | The destination dynamic advanced variable is a reference to the source advanced variable. |
| Dynamic advanced type = Dynamic advanced type | The destination dynamic advanced variable is a reference to the source dynamic advanced variable. |
