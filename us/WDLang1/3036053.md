## Remarks


### Default extension (when creating a file with the fSelCreate constant)
<a name="default_extension_when_creating_file_with_the_fselcreate_constant_ELTPARAGRAPHE000246"></a>

The extension of a selected file (file to create) differs according to:

- &lt;Default extension&gt;, 

- the extension entered by the user.




For example, the table below presents the extension that will be taken into account according to &lt;Default extension&gt; and to the extension entered by the user:

| &lt;Default extension&gt; | Extension entered by the user | Extension taken into account when creating the file |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ".TXT" | "File.BMP"<br>BMP is a valid and recognized extension. | "File.BMP" |
| ".TXT" | "File.PAF" <br>PAF is an invalid extension. The name of the file will be completed by the &lt;Default extension&gt;. | "File.PAF.TXT" |
| ".TXT" | "File" <br>No extension is entered. The &lt;Default extension&gt; is used. | "File.TXT" |
| "" (empty string) | "File.BMP"<br>BMP is a valid and recognized extension. | "File.BMP" |
| "" (empty string) | "File.PAF" <br>PAF is an invalid extension. The name of the file will be completed by the first extension found in the "Type of file" displayed.<br>Type of file displayed: "Text (\*.TXT;\*.DOC)" | "File.PAF.TXT" |
| "" (empty string) | "File.PAF" <br>PAF is an invalid extension. The type of the file being "\*.\*", the invalid extension is kept. <br>Type of file displayed: "All files (\*.\*)" | "File.PAF" |
| "" (empty string) | "File"<br>No extension is entered. The extension used is the first extension found in the "Type of file" displayed.<br>Type of file displayed: "Text (\*.TXT;\*.DOC)" | "File.TXT" |
| "" (empty string) | "File"<br>No extension is entered. The type of the file being "\*.\*", the name of the file is kept without extension. <br>Type of file displayed: "All files (\*.\*)" | "File" |


<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Default extension when opening a file
<a name="default_extension_when_opening_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000337"></a>

The extension of a selected file (file to open) corresponds to the extension selected by default when opening the file picker. &lt;Default extension&gt; must correspond to the letters corresponding to the extension ("lst" to select "\*.lst" by default).
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Clicking a file found in the file picker
<a name="clicking_file_found_the_file_picker_ELTPARAGRAPHE000344"></a>

To run a specific process when clicking a file found in the file picker, branch an event on the message <u><u><u><u>WM_USER + 600</u></u></u></u> (1624). When this message is received:

- the ***lParam*** variable contains the address of the selected file

- the ***wParam*** variable contains the address of the selected file.




For example, you have the ability to play the sound selected in the file picker (see Example 2, available by clicking the "Example" link at the top of help page).
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Selecting directories
<a name="selecting_directories_ELTPARAGRAPHE000360"></a>

**fSelect** is used to select files. To select a directory, use [fSelectDir](../WDLang1/3036050.md).
<a name="NOTE0_7"></a>
![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png) 

### Network drives, manifest and UAC
<a name="network_drives_manifest_and_uac_ELTPARAGRAPHE000374"></a>

In Windows Vista and later, if the UAC is enabled and if the executable is generated with a manifest requesting privileges (see [Generating the executable](../Editeurs/2025013.md)), the file picker opened by **fSelect** will have no access to the network drives associated with the user who opened the Windows session. For more details, see [FAQ about Windows Vista and later](../Editeurs/2025016.md).
