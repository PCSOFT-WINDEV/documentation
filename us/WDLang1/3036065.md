## Remarks


- These directories were specified when creating the setup program or when installing the application. 

- This function does not allow you to find out the directory containing the reports and/or queries saved via "Save as" in Reports & Queries. This directory can be known in the description window of the specified report or query.

- The possible change of directories is applied to the current instance of the executable. The directories specified during the setup are not modified by the function. Therefore, these directories will not be modified in Reports and Queries.
