Notifies when the device has been shaken in any direction.

## Example


```wl
// Detect the end of the shake gesture
SensorDetectEndShake("ProcShakeDetection")
```

```wl
// ProcShakeDetection procedure
PROCEDURE ProcShakeDetection(nDuration is int)
ToastDisplay(StringBuild("End of shake gesture. Duration: %1 thousands of a second", nDuration))

// End of shake detection
SensorDetectEndShake("")
```

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = SensorDetectEndShake(<WLanguage procedure> [, <Sensitivity> [, <Shake beginning duration> [, <Interval>]]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the detection of the end of the shake gesture was triggered,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise.




**`<WLanguage procedure>: (Procedure name)`**

Name of the WLanguage procedure ("callback") called when device is no longer shaken. This procedure has the following format : 

```txt
PROCEDURE <Procedure name>(<Duration>)
```
where &lt;Duration&gt; is an integer that corresponds to the duration of the shake gesture (in thousands of a second). 

The parameters of this procedure are optional. There is no need to pass parameters to this procedure. Indeed, these parameters are automatically filled during each call

If the procedure name is an empty string (""), the shake end detection will be stopped.

**`<Sensitivity>: (Optional integer or optional Integer constant)`**

Indicates the level of sensitivity to shake gestures. Corresponds to:

- value included between 0 and 2000: 0 for a very high sensitivity to shakes, 2000 for a very low sensitivity. 

- one of the following constants:  
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *snrSensitivityHigh* | High sensitivity to shake gestures. Even a low device shaking will trigger the notification. |
| *snrSensitivityLow* | Low sensitivity to shake gestures. Only a strong device shaking will trigger the notification. |
| *snrSensitivityNormal* <br>(Default value) | Standard sensitivity to shake gestures |






**`<Shake beginning duration>: (Optional integer or optional Duration)`**

Minimum duration (in thousands of a second) during which the device must be shaken before shake detection begins. By default, the minimum duration is set to 200 thousands of a second.
This parameter can correspond to: 

- an integer corresponding to the number of thousands of a second,

- a Duration variable,

- the duration in a readable format (e.g., 1 s or 10 ms). 




**`<Interval>: (Optional integer or optional Duration)`**

Maximum time interval (in thousands of a second) during which the shake gestures can stay below the specified sensitivity level before triggering a shake end notification. By default, the maximum duration is set to 200 thousands of a second.
This duration can correspond to: 

- an integer corresponding to the number of thousands of a second,

- a Duration variable,

- the duration in a readable format (e.g., 1 s or 10 ms).

## Remarks


### Use conditions
<a name="use_conditions_ELTPARAGRAPHE000117"></a>

- The shake detection mechanism uses uses the accelerometer of the device. No shake detection will be performed if the device does not have this sensor. The sensitivity of the detection depends on the quality of the sensor in the device.



<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Special cases
<a name="special_cases_ELTPARAGRAPHE000138"></a>

- If shake end and beginning detection (triggered by **SensorDetectEndShake** and [SensorDetectBeginShake](../WDLang1/1000019363.md) respectively) take place at the same time, the parameters (&lt;Sensitivity&gt;, &lt;Shake beginning duration&gt; and &lt;Interval&gt;) are the same in both cases. The values taken into account are the ones specified by the function called last.

- We advise you to stop shake detection when it is no longer required in order to reduce battery consumption. To do so, &lt;WLanguage procedure&gt; must correspond to an empty string (""). 
	[SensorEnd](../WDLang1/1000019644.md) is used to stop all the current detections.
