## Remarks


- If no sound card is found (or installed), the speaker found on the motherboard is used to emit a beep.

- The function is not locking: as soon as the sound is started, the rest of the program is run. The program does not wait for the end of the sound.

- The user can disable the sound system via the control panel.

- If several calls to **Beep** are performed one after another in the same process, only a single sound will be heard.
