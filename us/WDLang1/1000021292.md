## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000227"></a>
[semaphores](../WDLang1/3077013.md) are used to limit the simultaneous execution of a code (procedure, line of code, etc.) to one or more threads at a given time. A semaphore can be shared between several applications.

Other systems can also be used to protect a code section: 

- Mutexes are used to limit the simultaneous execution of a code (procedure, line of code, etc.) **to one thread** at a given time. A mutex can be shared between several applications. For more details, see [Managing mutexes in threads](../WDLang1/1000019475.md). 

- **Critical sections**: A critical section is a *semaphore limited to a single thread* on a single code section (process, procedure, etc.).

## What is a critical section
<a name="what_critical_section_ELTTEXTE000251"></a>
A critical section is a **semaphore limited to a single thread** on a single code section (process, procedure, etc.).

Unlike the semaphores, a critical section can be used once only.

For example, a critical section can be used to protect a procedure for updating the window controls.

Remark: The critical sections are unique for the application that created them. They cannot be shared between several applications.

WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile offer several methods to implement critical sections.

## The CriticalSection variable
<a name="the_criticalsection_variable_ELTTEXTE000275"></a>
The [CriticalSection](../WDLang1/1000023972.md) variable allows to easily implement a critical section thanks to the syntax [USING .. IN](../Motscles/1510025.md). 

Example: 

```wl
s is CriticalSection
USING s IN
	// code protected by the critical section
	// only one thread will execute this code at a given moment

END
```


Remarks: 

- The **CriticalSection** type is used to simplify the declaration of critical sections. 

- **CriticalSection** variables respect the rules for variable scope.

## Critical section associated with a variable
<a name="critical_section_associated_with_variable_ELTTEXTE000299"></a>
When declaring a variable, this variable can be associated with a critical section by using the **critical section** attribute. 

The syntax is as follows: 


```txt
VariableName is VariableType <critical section>

or 

VariableName is VariableType, critical section
```


The code sections that use these variables must be found between [CriticalSectionStart](../WDLang1/3077001.md) and [CriticalSectionEnd](../WDLang1/3077005.md).


### Special case
<a name="special_case_ELTPARAGRAPHE000090"></a>

A critical section is automatically associated with the variables on which simple operations are performed, such as: 

- assigning a value.

- retrieving a value.

- incrementat, decrement (+, -, ++, --, +=, -= operators +, -, ++, --, += -=).





### Example
<a name="example_ELTPARAGRAPHE000101"></a>


```wl
// Global declarations of WIN_STAT window
gcySum is currency, critical section
gcyMax is currency, critical section
...
```

```wl
// Code run by several threads
cyOrderAmount is currency 
...
// atomic operation, the critical section is automatically managed by WLanguage
gcySum += cyAmountOrder

// multiple operation, it is necessary to implement the critical section explicitly
USING CriticalSection(gcyMax) IN
	IF cyAmountOrder > gcyMax THEN
		gcyMax = cyAmountOrder
	END
END
```



### Remarks
<a name="remarks_ELTPARAGRAPHE000115"></a>



- The **critical section** attribute is allowed for:

	- the global project variables, set of procedures, window, page and report.

	- the local variables.

	- the members of classes.

	- the arrays: in this case, the attribute is associated with the array and not with the array elements.




- The queues and the stacks are protected by default: the **critical section** attribute is not required.

## Named critical section
<a name="named_critical_section_ELTTEXTE000341"></a>


### How it works
<a name="how_works_ELTPARAGRAPHE000137"></a>

The critical section is defined by [CriticalSectionStart](../WDLang1/3077001.md) and ended by [CriticalSectionEnd](../WDLang1/3077005.md). 

The name of the CriticalSection is passed as a parameter to these functions via a string. 

Example: 


```wl
// Use of a named critical section
CriticalSectionStart("MySection")
// Two threads will not be able to run this code at the same time
...
CriticalSectionEnd("MySection")
```


This method of using critical sections has several drawbacks: 

- risk of collisions between several critical sections with the same name. 

- never-released critical sections.

## Programming in WLanguage
<a name="programming_wlanguage_ELTTEXTE000365"></a>


### Functions for managing critical sections
<a name="functions_for_managing_critical_sections_ELTPARAGRAPHE000169"></a>The following WLanguage functions are used to manage critical sections:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [CriticalSection](../WDLang1/1000024373.md) | Enables a name or on-variable critical section in the statement [USING ... IN](../Motscles/1510025.md). |
| [CriticalSectionEnd](../WDLang1/3077005.md) | Marks the end of critical section: the code will be run by another thread. |
| [CriticalSectionStart](../WDLang1/3077001.md) | Marks the start of a critical section: no other thread will be able to run the code as long as the current thread does not exit from the critical section. |





To manage critical sections, it is also possible to use the following type: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [CriticalSection](../WDLang1/1000023972.md) | **CriticalSection** variables are used to define critical sections to limit the simultaneous execution of a code (procedure, line of code, etc.) **to one thread** at a given moment in an application. |
