## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000247"></a>
To give your applications an outstanding touch and to impress the users when starting your applications, the windows can be animated when they are opened and/or closed: a window can turn around when it is opened, coming from the background of the screen, ... (a little bit like video effects).

The effect can be fixed or chosen at random.

This feature can be defined in the options of the project, in the window description or through programming.

If a window loads several elements, an "animation" (performed independently of the current processes) allows the users to wait for the window to be ready!

This feature must be used sparingly to avoid annoying the users. You can for example animate the first window of your application or limit this animation to a specific number of windows.

**Remark**: The context menu of windows (AAFs) allows the user to disable the animations of windows ("Disable the animations of windows"). For more details, see [Automatic feature: Disabling the animation](#NOTE2_4).

### Configuring the animation of windows at project level
<a name="configuring_the_animation_windows_project_level_ELTPARAGRAPHE000031"></a>

To configure the animation of windows at project level:

1. Open the project description window: on the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, click "Description".

2. In the "Advanced" tab, click "Animations of windows".

3. The window that is displayed allows you to configure the animation:

	- of the first project window.

	- all the project windows.







To configure **the animation of the first project window**: 

1. Choose the animation to perform (opening or closing) and click the "None" link.

2. In the window that appears, check "Enable the animation" and select the animation parameters: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Anim_Fenetre2.gif)


	- Duration of animation (in hundredths of a second).

- Type of animation (if the random mode is chosen, the animation will be automatically selected by the application whenever the window is opened).

3. The "Preview" button allows you to view the selected parameters.

4. You can also apply the selected animation to the current window (check "Animate this description window").

5. Validate.


Remark: A window must necessarily be defined as "First project window".

To configure **the animation of all project windows**: 

1. Choose the animation to perform (opening or closing) and click the "None" link.

2. In the window that appears, check "Enable the animation" and select the animation parameters:

	- Duration of animation (in hundredths of a second).

	- Type of animation (if the random mode is chosen, the animation will be automatically selected by the application whenever the window is opened).




3. The "Preview" button allows you to view the selected parameters.

4. You can also apply the selected animation to the current window (check "Animate this description window").

5. Validate.

6. Specify the frequency of animations:

	- **Always**: the animation will be performed on each application window.

	- **Often**: the animation will be performed whenever a window out of ten is opened/closed.

	- **Rarely**: the animation will be performed whenever a window out of thirty is opened/closed.

	- Custom frequency.





Remark: This setting is taken into account by all the windows with no specific setting. For example:

- if the opening animation defined for all the project windows corresponds to "None" and if an opening animation was configured for the "WIN_Customer" window, this animation will be performed when opening the "WIN_Customer" window.

- if the opening animation defined for all the project windows corresponds to "Custom" and if an opening animation was configured for the "WIN_Customer" window, the animation defined for the "WIN_Customer" window will be performed when this window is opened.

### Configuring the animation of windows at window level
<a name="configuring_the_animation_windows_window_level_ELTPARAGRAPHE000121"></a>

To configure the animation of windows at window level: 

1. Open the window to animate in the window editor.  

2. Open the window description (select "Description" in the context menu).

3. In the "Details" tab, choose the type of animation to perform (opening or closing) and click the "None" link.

4. In the window that appears, check "Enable the animation" and select the animation parameters: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Anim_Fenetre2.gif)


	- Duration of animation (in hundredths of a second).

- Type of animation (if the random mode is chosen, the animation will be automatically selected by the application whenever the window is opened).

5. The "Preview" button allows you to view the selected parameters.

6. You can also apply the selected animation to the current window (check "Animate this description window").

7. Validate.




**Remark**: This setting is applied to the current window even if a different setting was specified at project level.

### Configuring the animation of windows through programming
<a name="configuring_the_animation_windows_through_programming_ELTPARAGRAPHE000154"></a>Several WLanguage functions are used to configure the animation of windows:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [WinAnimationClosing](../WDLang1/3038050.md) | Modifies the type and duration of the animation used when closing the application windows. |
| [WinAnimationNext](../WDLang1/3038052.md) | Modifies the type and duration of animations used when opening and closing the next window. |
| [WinAnimationOpening](../WDLang1/3038051.md) | Modifies the type and duration of animations used when opening the application windows. |





These functions can be applied to the windows for which no animation was configured otherwise (from the project editor or from the window editor for example).

[WinDisableEffect](../WDLang1/1000017172.md) is used to disable the animation of windows (on a TSE computer with low bandwidth for example).
<a name="NOTE2_4"></a>


### Automatic feature: Disabling the animation
<a name="automatic_feature_disabling_the_animation_ELTPARAGRAPHE000168"></a>

The user can disable the window animations at any time, via the option "Disable window animations" in the window context menu. This option prevents the use of window animations on all the windows of the project. 

**To avoid proposing this option in the popup menu of windows**, you can: 

- disable the option for all the project windows: 

	1. On the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, click "Description". The project description window appears. 

	2. In the "Advanced" tab, click "AAF menu". 

	3. Select the "Window" element and uncheck "Disable the animations of windows". 




- disable the option when necessary, through programming with [AAFDisable](../WDLang1/1000022018.md) associated with the *aafDisableWindowAnimation* constant.
