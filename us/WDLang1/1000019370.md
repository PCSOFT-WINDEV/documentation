## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000118"></a>
The applications can be controlled by the movements of the mobile device (phone or tablet)!

For example, a movement to the right goes to the next form, a movement to the left goes to the previous form, a movement to the top positions at the beginning of the file and a movement to the bottom positions at the end of the file.

This type of interface can be easily programmed with WINDEV Mobile.

The Sensor functions allow you to propose this type of interface.

Among the supported actions:

- bump (sharp movement) (beginning and end), 

- change of acceleration, 

- change of orientation, 

- orientation (compass).




This type of interface can be combined or can coexist with a standard interface (buttons, ...).

## Available functions

The following functions are used to manage the compass and the accelerometer of a mobile device (phone or tablet):



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [SensorDetectBeginShake](../WDLang1/1000019363.md) | Notifies when the device is shaken in any direction. |
| [SensorDetectChangeAcceleration](../WDLang1/1000019362.md) | Notifies when acceleration forces are applied to the device along any of the three axes. |
| [SensorDetectChangeOrientation](../WDLang1/1000019361.md) | Allows you to be notified when the orientation of the device changes on any one of its 3 axes. |
| [SensorDetectEndShake](../WDLang1/1000019364.md) | Notifies when the device has been shaken in any direction. |
| [SensorEnd](../WDLang1/1000019644.md) | Indicates the end of the use of the sensor functions. |
| [SensorGetOrientation](../WDLang1/1000019369.md) | Retrieves the current orientation of the device on one of its 3 axes. |
