## Example


```wl
// Interact with the user 
AnAnswer is string 
AnAnswer = ExecuteMainThread(UserInteractionProcedure, "Message")
```

<a name="XSYNTAX"></a>

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = ExecuteMainThread(<WLanguage procedure> [, <Parameter 1> [... [, <Parameter N>]]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Character string)`**

Return value of procedure called. This value is identical to the value obtained if the procedure is run directly.

**`<WLanguage procedure>: (Procedure name)`**

Name of procedure to run.

**`<Parameter 1>: (Optional)`**

Parameters that will be passed to the procedure. Caution: these parameters are passed by value (not by reference).



**`<Parameter N>: (Optional)`**

Parameters that will be passed to the procedure. Caution: these parameters are passed by value (not by reference).

## Remarks


### Operating mode
<a name="operating_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000066"></a>

The procedure execution is performed by the main thread when this one is waiting for interactions with the user. 

Therefore, when the main application thread must run procedures called by **ExecuteMainThread**, the following rules must be complied with:

- the main thread must be highly available: sort and localized critical sections, no long process when a secondary thread may have to call **ExecuteMainThread**, no wait for synchronization objects (semaphores, events, etc.).

- the call to **ExecuteMainThread** from the threads must be done without "keeping" synchronization objects (critical sections, semaphores, events, ...) to avoid a deadlock.




If the main thread is running a process, this process is not interrupted and the procedure will be run when the main thread switches back to waiting for interaction with the user.

However, [Multitask](../WDLang1/3015004.md) allows you to interrupt a long process in order to process the user actions and to run the procedures called by **ExecuteMainThread**.

The call to **ExecuteMainThread** is locking as long as the procedure was not run by the main thread. 

Caution: 

- **ExecuteMainThread** cannot be used to call a procedure of "parent" execution context. For example, a project procedure cannot be called from an external component.

- The errors and exceptions coming from the procedure run are carried over to the calling thread during the call to **ExecuteMainThread**.
