<a name="Use"></a>
<a name="description"></a>
Entirely or partially locks an external file. The file will be unlocked:

- using the [fUnlock](../WDLang1/3036020.md) function, 

- when the file is closed.




The application that locked the file can read this file and write into this file. The other applications cannot read this file or write into this file.

```wl
// Open an external file
FileID = fOpen("C:\MyDirectories\File.txt", foReadWrite)
IF FileID <> -1 THEN
	...
	// Lock the external file
	ResLock = fLock(FileID)
	...
END
```



```wl
// Open an external file
MyFile is DiskFile
MyFile = fOpen("C:\MyDirectories\File.txt", foReadWrite)
IF NOT ErrorOccurred THEN
	...
	// Lock the external file
	ResLock = fLock(MyFile)
	...
END

## Syntax

`<Result> = fLock(<File used> [, <First byte to lock> [, <Number of bytes to lock>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the file was locked, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise.




**`<File used>: (Integer or DiskFile variable)`**



- Identifier of the file to use, defined by [fOpen](../WDLang1/3036036.md) or [fCreate](../WDLang1/3036017.md).

- Name of the [DiskFile](../WDLang1/1410088883.md) variable initialized with [fOpen](../WDLang1/3036036.md) or [fCreate](../WDLang1/3036017.md).




**`<First byte to lock>: (Optional integer)`**

Position of the first byte to lock (0 corresponds to the first byte of the file).

**`<Number of bytes to lock>: (Optional constant or integer)`**



- Number of bytes to lock in the file. 

- Constant:

| *fLockEmptyFile* | **fLock** has the same behavior whether the file is empty or not (see Remarks). |

## Remarks


### The lock was not set
<a name="the_lock_was_not_set_ELTPARAGRAPHE000132"></a>

**fLock** returns <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if the file was not locked. The lock can be set only if:

- the external file is opened, 

- the file identifier is valid, 

- the file or the bytes to lock are not already locked by another computer or by another application.



<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Locking a file
<a name="locking_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000151"></a>

- The file is entirely locked if &lt;First byte to lock&gt; and &lt;Number of bytes to lock&gt; are not specified.

- The file is locked from the first byte to lock (&lt;First byte to lock&gt;) until the end if &lt;Number of bytes to lock&gt; is not specified.

- By default, **fLock** does not lock any bytes if the file is empty. In this case, several applications can successfully "lock" an empty file. However, the file cannot be overwritten as long as it is locked.




To get the same behavior no matter whether the file is empty or not, use the ***fLockEmptyFile*** constant.

![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) The lock is effective between two different sites or contexts. Unlike Windows, a process cannot lock a file that was previouly locked.
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Position in the file
<a name="position_the_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000170"></a>

When opening a file, the current position corresponds to:

- the first file byte (by default), 

- the last file byte if the file is opened in "addition" mode (*foAdd* constant).




This position can be modified by [fSeek](../WDLang1/3036039.md).

The current position does not change when **fLock** is used.

### Operating mode in Windows Vista (and later)
<a name="operating_mode_windows_vista_and_later_ELTPARAGRAPHE000333"></a>

If this function does not operate properly in Windows Vista (and later), check whether the file or directory used is not in one of the system directories (Windows directory or "Program Files" directory).

**In Windows Vista (and later), with the [UAC mechanism](../Editeurs/2025014.md) (User Account Control) enabled**, you must have administrator privileges to handle and/or modify the files or directories in system directories (Windows directory or "Program Files" directory).

**Programming tip**: To handle and/or modify the files or directories without administrator privileges, you should:

- avoid writing to the Windows directory or to the "Program Files" directory, 

- use the system directory of the application (returned by [SysDir](../WDLang1/3073026.md) with the *srAppDataCommun* constant, for example).
