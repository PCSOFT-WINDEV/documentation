The **Process** type is used to define the characteristics of the remote application that can be started by [ExeRemoteRun](../WDLang1/1000018695.md). 

The characteristics of this application can be defined and changed using different WLanguage properties.

**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

## Example


```wl
AppToStart is Process
AppToStart.Executable = "myapp.exe"
AppToStart.CommandLine = "/SILENT"
AppToStart.ExecutionLogin = "DOMAIN\USER"
AppToStart.ExecutionPassword = "mypassword"

ExeRemoteRun(AppToStart, exeReturnValue, "COMPUTER2")
WHILE AppToStart.ExecutionInProgress
	Wait(100)
END

### Properties specific to Process variables
<a name="properties_specific_process_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000033"></a>

The following properties can be used to handle a process:

| **Property name** | **Type used** | **Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CommandLine | Character string | Command line of application to start. The executable name must not be found in this command line. |
| ComputerName | Character string | Name of remote computer on which the process will be run. <br>**This property is read-only**. |
| Executable | Character string | Path of application to start. This path is local to the computer where the application will be started. The application must be found on the remote computer because [ExeRemoteRun](../WDLang1/1000018695.md) does not copy the executable.<br>No UNC path can be used. |
| ExecutionInProgress | Boolean | <br><br>- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the remote application is currently run,<br><br>- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. <br>	**This property is read-only**.<br><br><br> |
| ExecutionLogin | Character string | Login of user who must start the process. This login can correspond to: <br><br>- a character string whose format is "Domain\\User". <br><br>- the *AccountLocalSystem* constant: In this case, the application will be started with the account of the operating system. <br><br><br>If this property corresponds to an empty string, the current user account is used (user account on the current computer). |
| ExecutionPassword | Character string | Password associated with the user. <br>This property is available in write mode. |
| PID | Integer | Identifier of process. This property is set to -1 if the execution of the remote application is completed. |
| ReturnValue | Integer | Return value returned by the remote application. If the remote application is not completed, this property is set to 257. If the remote application was not started, this property is set to 0. |
| WorkingDirectory | Character string | Directory for starting the remote application.  This path is local to the computer where the application will be started. |
