## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000277"></a>
Custom telemetry allows you to define the elements that will be included in the analytics. These elements are defined via "sensors". 

- These sensors can be configured in the telemetry editor.  

- The value of the sensors can be modified in the code of the application, using different WLanguage functions. 


The results of this custom telemetry will be displayed in specific widgets. 

**To use custom data in the telemetry**, you must: 

- Create a custom telemetry. 

- Create the widgets displayed by the telemetry. 

- Configure the widgets by defining what information picked up by the sensors will be displayed. 

- Include in the code the calls required to manage the sensors. 

- Deploy the application and its custom telemetry.

![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=T%E9l%E9m%E9trie_perso%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)
In this window, you can specify: 

	- The type of sensor: 

		- Waypoint: This type of sensor makes it possible to count the elements taken into account by the telemetry. For example, it can count the number of new invoices, cancelled invoices, users who used a given feature, etc.

		- Value measurement: This type of sensor is used to count an element. For example, it can count the number of products per invoice, etc.

		- Time measurement: This type of sensor is used to measure the time it takes to complete an action. For example, it can measure the time it takes to prepare an order. 




- The aggregation mode used by the sensor: 

	- According to time only: The data will be grouped only by time. 

	- According to time and to a category: The data will be grouped according to time and the specified category. 

3. Validate. The new sensor appears in the "List of sensors" widget.

## Include in the code the calls required to manage the sensors
<a name="include_the_code_the_calls_required_manage_the_sensors_ELTTEXTE000361"></a>
One or more sensors are created along with a widget. 

To save the data from these sensors, they must be managed in the application processes. Two WLanguage functions are available: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [TelemetryAddMeasure](../WDLang1/1000022168.md) | Adds a measure for a value or time sensor. |
| [TelemetryAddPassage](../WDLang1/1000022174.md) | Signals the code execution for a passage sensor. |



For example: 

- Measurement sensor: 
	
	```wl
	// A "NumberProducts" sensor was defined in the editor
	// Whenever an order is validated, the number of products found in the order is added
	TelemetryAddMeasure(NumberProducts, ProductTable..Occurrence)
	```


- Passage sensor: 
	
	```wl
	// An "OrderCancellation" sensor was defined in the editor.
	// Whenever an order is canceled, we identify the use of the feature
	// by the user
	TelemetryAddPassage(OrderCancellation)
	```

## Deploying the custom telemetry
<a name="deploying_the_custom_telemetry_ELTTEXTE000401"></a>
In order for a custom telemetry to be taken into account, you must: 

1. Deploy the custom telemetry on the server. 

2. Generate and deploy the application containing the calls to the different sensors. 




To deploy the custom telemetry, click the "Deploy" option found in the "Custom telemetry" pane.
