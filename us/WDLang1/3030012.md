## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000304"></a>
For some types of controls, WINDEV and WEBDEV propose an automatic management of Drag and Drop. 

**No specific programming is required**. In the control description, all you have to do is specify that Drag and Drop must be supported. 

You must not: 

- call the functions for managing the Drag and Drop through programming, 

- enable the codes for managing the Drag and Drop in the processes of the controls. 




Otherwise, the automatic management will be disabled: therefore, Drag and Drop must be managed through programming.

- [the controls affected by the automatic Drag and Drop in WEBDEV](#NOTE3_1).

## WINDEV: The controls affected by the automatic Drag and Drop
<a name="windev_the_controls_affected_the_automatic_drag_and_drop_ELTTEXTE000328"></a>
In WINDEV, the automatic Drag and Drop is available for the following controls: 

- Edit control,

- List Box control, 

- ListView control, 

- Table control,

- TreeView control. 




**Special cases**: Drag and Drop between two Table controls: 
To perform an automatic Drag and Drop between two Table controls:

- The number of columns must be identical. The content of column 1 of source Table control will be copied into column 1 of target Table control, idem for column 2, ...

- The columns can have different names.

- The type of columns can be different. CAUTION: In this case, the data can be altered or lost during the transfer (automatic conversions). In this case, we recommend that you use the [Programmed Drag and Drop](../WDLang1/3030013.md). 





### Moves allowed between controls:

| Source element | Target element | Action performed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Table control based on a data file | Table control populated programmatically | The rows selected in the source Table control are copied into the target Table control. |
|   | List Box control populated programmatically | The rows selected in the Table control are copied into the target List Box control: the data found in the columns is separated by tabulations. |
|   | Edit control | <br><br>- on a simple edit control, only the first element is copied. The elements found in the different columns are separated by tabulations.<br><br>- on a multiline edit control, all elements are copied (separated by a CR). The elements found in the different columns are separated by tabulations.<br><br><br> |
| Table control populated programmatically | Table control populated programmatically | The rows selected in the Table control are copied into the target Table control. |

| TreeView control populated programmatically | TreeView control populated programmatically | The selected branch (and its children) are copied to the selected position in the target TreeView control. |
|   | List Box control populated programmatically | Only the first selected branch is copied to the target List Box control. The child elements are not copied. |
|   | Edit control | Only the first selected branch is copied. The child elements are not copied. |
| TreeView Table control based on a data file | TreeView control populated programmatically | The selected branch (and its children) are copied to the selected position in the target TreeView control. |
|   | List Box control populated programmatically | Only the first selected branch is copied to the target List Box control. The child elements are not copied. |
|   | Edit control | Only the first selected branch is copied. The children are ignored. |
| List Box control populated programmatically | List Box control populated programmatically | The selected rows are copied into the target List Box control. |
|   | TreeView control populated programmatically | The selected elements are copied into the target TreeView control as branches. |
|   | Edit control | <br><br>- On a simple edit control, only the first element is copied.<br><br>- On a multiline edit control, all elements are copied (separated by a CR).<br><br><br> |
| List Box control based on a data file | List Box control populated programmatically | The selected rows are copied into the target List Box control. |
|   | TreeView control populated programmatically | The selected elements are copied into the target TreeView control as branches. |
|   | Edit control | <br><br>- On a simple edit control, only the first element is copied.<br><br>- On a multiline edit control, all elements are copied (separated by a CR). <br><br><br> |
| Edit control | Edit control | The control content is copied to the target control. For an operation performed from a multiline edit control to a simple edit control, only the first row is copied. |



**Remark**: These controls can be:

- in the same window, 

- in another window of the application (Multi-windowing or MDi), 

- in a window of another WINDEV application.




For the other types of controls that accept Drag and Drop, the Drag and Drop must be programmed (see [Programmed Drag and Drop](../WDLang1/3030013.md)).

## WEBDEV: The controls affected by the automatic Drag and Drop
<a name="webdev_the_controls_affected_the_automatic_drag_and_drop_ELTTEXTE000358"></a>
In WEBDEV, the automatic Drag and Drop is available for the following controls: 

- Upload control,

- Static control,

- Button control, 

- Link control,

- Image control,

- Formatted Static control,

- Edit control, 

- List Box control,

- Combo Box control. 




**Moves allowed between controls**: 

| Source element | Action performed |
| --- | --- |
| Button | The button caption is copied. |
| Static or formatted static | The content of the static is copied. |
| Link | The link caption is copied. |
| List box or combo box | The selected row is copied. |
| Image | If the destination is an image, the image content is copied.<br><br>If the destination is another type of control, the image path is copied. |
| Edit control | The control content is copied to the target control. |





**Remark**: At this time, only Firefox and Chrome fully support Drag and Drop via HTML 5. If the new versions of the different browsers include the management of Drag and Drop via HTML 5, this feature will be automatically supported by WEBDEV.

## Configuring the default Drag and Drop
<a name="configuring_the_default_drag_and_drop_ELTTEXTE000382"></a>
For the controls that propose the automatic Drag and Drop,  this feature is configured in the "Details" screen of control description.
<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Dnd_pardefaut.gif)


The "Is source" option is used to define the control as "Source" of Drag and Drop. The user will be able to select the content of the control and to move it to another control for example.

The "Is target" option is used to define the control as "Target" of Drag and Drop. This control will be able to receive any object "dropped" by the user.

The two options can be selected simultaneously.

**Remarks**: 

- If only the "Is source" option is checked for the control, the action performed by default will be a copy. The cut is not allowed. 

- If the "Is source" and "Is target" options are checked for the control, the action performed by default will be a cut. Press the Ctrl key simultaneously to perform a copy. 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png) In TreeView controls, it is possible to: 

	- copy or move a root element before or after an element of the TreeView control.

	- copy or move an element to a sub-level of the TreeView control.

	- copy or move a single element or an element and all its children.
