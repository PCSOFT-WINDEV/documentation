## Example


```wl
// Identify the next control in input mode
ResControl = ControlNext()
```

<a name="XSYNTAX"></a>
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

## Syntax

`<Result> = ControlNext()`
---

**`<Result>: (Character string)`**

Name of the next control in input mode. The name of the control should be written with the same uppercase/lowercase characters as when the control was created.  



<a name="NOTE0"></a>
<a name="NOTE0_1"></a>

## Remarks


- **ControlNext** can only be called in the "Exit" event of a control. If **ControlNext** is called in another event or process, the name of the control returned will not make sense.

- When the user presses the TAB key, **ControlNext** returns the name of the next control according to the tab order defined in the editor. 
	Reminder: To set the tab order, go to the "Window" tab, "Order" group, expand "Tab order" and select "Edit".

- However, when the user clicks a control, **ControlNext** returns the name of that control.
