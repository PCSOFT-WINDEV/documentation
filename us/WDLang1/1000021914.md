## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = SysUnlinkExtension(<Extension> [, <User>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the unlink operation was performed, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) returns more details.




**`<Extension>: (Character string)`**

Extension to free. 

**`<User>: (Optional Integer constant)`**

The association between the application and the extension is saved in the registry. Two options are available: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *sysAllUsers*<br>(Default value) | The association will be deleted for all the users of the current computer. <br><br>Remark: You must have the "Administrator" rights to run this operation. |
| *sysCurrentUser* | The association will be deleted for the current user only. |

## Remarks
Once the extension is freed, the explorer can temporarily store the association or propose the program that was previously linked (independent data of registries).
