<a name="description"></a>
Adds a word to the dictionary of OpenOffice: 

- for the instance of current application. 

- for all the applications.




After this addition, the word will be considered as being correct by [SpellCheck](../WDLang1/1000018923.md). 

**Remark**: Most controls in a WINDEV application offer the possibility to use the spelling checker ("Check spelling" in the "Details" tab of the control description). 

**Tip**: It is recommended to use **SpellAddDictionary** in the "Initializing" event of the project. Thus, the OpenOffice spelling checker will not consider certain words as errors, such as the name of the application, and application-specific terms.

`SpellAddDictionary(<Word to Add> [, <Range>])`
---

**`<Word to Add>: (Character string)`**

Scope of the addition into the dictionary. This parameter corresponds to one of the following constants:

| --- | --- |
| *spellScopePersistent* | The word is added into the dictionary of OpenOffice. <br>This constant has the same effect as the "Add to dictionary" option in the context menu of AAF with spelling checker. |
| *spellScopeProcess*<br>(Default value) | The word is not added into the dictionary of OpenOffice.<br>Therefore, it will be still be displayed as "False" if the application is restarted. |
