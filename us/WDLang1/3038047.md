**`<Result>: (Type corresponding to the retrieved value (optional))`**

Value returned by the popup window when it is closed. This value is returned:

- by the [RETURN](../Motscles/1510007.md) keyword in the window closing code,

- by the [Close](../WDLang1/3038018.md) function,

**`<Parameter 1>: (Type of value sent to the window (optional))`**

## Remarks


### Characteristics of the popup window
<a name="characteristics_the_popup_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000135"></a>

- The window is automatically closed when it loses focus or during the call to [Close](../WDLang1/3038018.md). The current value is returned to the control that opened the popup window by one of the following methods:

	- by the [RETURN](../Motscles/1510007.md) keyword in the window closing code,

	- by the [Close](../WDLang1/3038018.md) function,

	- by the [ReturnedValue](../Proprietes/2510134.md) property used before closing the window.




- The style of the popup windows is applied to the window opened by **OpenPopupPosition**. If a title bar was defined in the editor, this title bar is reduced and the window cannot be maximized or minimized.

- The popup window is opened below the control that calls **OpenPopupPosition**. If there is not enough space to open the window, the window will be opened either above the control, or below the control to the left.

<a name="parameters_passed_the_window_open_ELTPARAGRAPHE000166"></a>The parameters are retrieved in the event "Global declarations" of the window. Simply write the following line of code at the start:


```txt
PROCEDURE <Window name> (<Parameter1> [, <Parameter2> [, ...]])
```

**Remarks**:

- if you use only the *poBottom* constant, the popup window will be opened at position *poRight* + *poBottom*.

- if you use only the *poBottom* constant, the popup window will be opened at position *poRight* + *poTop*.

### Limitations
<a name="limitations_ELTPARAGRAPHE000204"></a>

- **OpenPopupPosition** must be executed from the code of a control.

- The control that calls **OpenPopupPosition** must be visible.

- Non-modal windows cannot be opened from a popup window. [Open](../WDLang1/3038035.md) must be used to open a window. Opening a modal window from a popup window does not automatically close the popup window. In this case, you must process the return value of [Open](../WDLang1/3038035.md) and you must use [Close](../WDLang1/3038018.md) to close the popup window.

- A popup window cannot be opened from a popup window.
