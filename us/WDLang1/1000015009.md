**`<Name of .Net control>: (Optional character string)`**

## Remarks


- It is recommended to call **&lt;Xaml&gt;.Event** in the Xaml control initialization code.

- **Important**: PC SOFT provides no technical support about the operating mode of .Net controls.
	You will find the different events supported by the .Net controls in their own documentation.
