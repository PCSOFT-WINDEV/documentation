## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000118"></a>
WINDEV allows you to easily manage the Undo/Redo feature in your applications with the ActionXXX functions. To do so, the user can press Ctrl + Z and Ctrl + Y to easily undo or redo an action.

## How to?
<a name="how_ELTTEXTE000142"></a>
To manage the Undo/Redo feature in your WINDEV applications: 

1. Declare the actions to save in the stack of actions performed by [ActionDo](../WDLang1/1000022676.md). This function expects as parameter the name of the procedure that corresponds to the action. This procedure can be a local, global or internal procedure. 

2. In the code of the procedure corresponding to the action to perform, use [ActionDeclareUndo](../WDLang1/1000022678.md) to define the code that will be run to cancel the action. This function expects as parameter the name of the procedure to run. This procedure can be a local, global or internal procedure.

3. Use the following functions if necessary: 

	- [ActionRedo](../WDLang1/1000022608.md) to run the last action canceled. 

	- [ActionUndo](../WDLang1/1000022677.md) to cancel the last action performed. 







Remarks: 

- You cannot stack several times the SAME actions defined by [ActionDo](../WDLang1/1000022676.md). Each action requested by [ActionDo](../WDLang1/1000022676.md) deletes the previous identical action. Therefore, only the last SAME action can be canceled.

- In the context menu of a control, the "Cancel" option proposed by default does not have the same effect as [ActionUndo](../WDLang1/1000022677.md) or Ctrl + Z.





### Example
<a name="example_ELTPARAGRAPHE000050"></a>The following example is used to modify the background color of two edit controls. This action can be undone by Ctrl + Z:


```wl
ActionDo(WIN_ACTION, Color)

	INTERNAL PROCEDURE Color
	EDT_LastName.BackgroundColor = PastelGreen
	EDT_FirstName.BackgroundColor = PastelRed
	
	ActionDeclareUndo(GoBack)
		INTERNAL PROCEDURE GoBack
		EDT_LastName.BackgroundColor = DefaultColor
		EDT_FirstName.BackgroundColor = DefaultColor
		END
	END
```


To allow the user to undo several actions, simply call [ActionDo](../WDLang1/1000022676.md) several times with different procedures. For example: 


```wl
ActionDo(WIN_ACTION, Color)
ActionDo(WIN_ACTION, StoreValue)

	INTERNAL PROCEDURE Color
	EDT_LastName.BackgroundColor = PastelGreen
	EDT_FirstName.BackgroundColor = PastelRed
	
	ActionDeclareUndo(GoBack)
		INTERNAL PROCEDURE GoBack
		EDT_LastName.BackgroundColor = DefaultColor
		EDT_FirstName.BackgroundColor = DefaultColor
		END
	END
	
	INTERNAL PROCEDURE StoreValue()
	EDT_LastName.Note = EDT_LastName
	EDT_FirstName.Note = EDT_FirstName
	
	ActionDeclareUndo(GoBack)
		INTERNAL PROCEDURE GoBack
		EDT_LastName = EDT_LastName.Note
		EDT_FirstName = EDT_FirstName.Note
		END
	END
```


In this example, the first Ctrl + Z will undo the storage of values and the second will undo the coloring of controls.

## WLanguage functions
<a name="wlanguage_functions_ELTTEXTE000172"></a>
The following WLanguage functions are used to manage the actions: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [ActionDeclareUndo](../WDLang1/1000022678.md) | Declares how to cancel an action that was added by [ActionDo](../WDLang1/1000022676.md). This function **MUST** be called when running the procedure supplied to [ActionDo](../WDLang1/1000022676.md). |
| [ActionDo](../WDLang1/1000022676.md) | Creates and runs a custom action (defined through programming) with support of "Undo/Redo". |
| [ActionRedo](../WDLang1/1000022608.md) | Runs the last action canceled. |
| [ActionUndo](../WDLang1/1000022677.md) | Cancels the last action performed by the end user. |
