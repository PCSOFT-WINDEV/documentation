## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

### Request the stop of a thread identified by its name

`ThreadRequestStop(<Thread name>)`
---

**`<Thread name>: (Character string)`**

Name of the thread to be stopped. This name is given when running the thread ([ThreadExecute](../WDLang1/3077024.md)). 


<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Request the stop of a thread identified by a Thread variable

`ThreadRequestStop(<Thread>)`
---

**`<Thread>: (Thread variable)`**

Name of the [Thread](../WDLang1/1000024879.md) variable that corresponds to the thread to stop. 



<a name="NOTE0"></a>
<a name="NOTE0_1"></a>

## Remarks


- The thread will not be stopped automatically. The thread code has to check if the stop is requested using [ThreadStopRequested](../WDLang1/1000021219.md), and terminate properly.

- It is a non-blocking function and does not wait for the thread to stop. You must use [ThreadWait](../WDLang1/3077020.md) to wait for the thread to stop.
