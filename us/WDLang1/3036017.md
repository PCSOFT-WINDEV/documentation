Creates an external file. This file is automatically opened in read/write.

**Remarks**: 

- To handle text external files, we recommend that you use [fLoadText](../WDLang1/3036006.md)/[fSaveText](../WDLang1/3036046.md) and [fLoadBuffer](../WDLang1/1000019410.md)/[fSaveBuffer](../WDLang1/1000019412.md). 

- To handle binary external files, we recommend that you use **fCreate** or [fOpen](../WDLang1/3036036.md).

## Syntax

`<Result> = fCreate(<File path> [, <Creation options>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**



- an integer:  

	- the identifier of the external file. This identifier will be used by all the functions for handling the external files.

	- -1 if an error occurred. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) with the *errMessage* constant.




- a variable of type [DiskFile](../WDLang1/1410088883.md). If an error occurs, the [ErrorOccurred](../WDLang1/3087001.md) variable is set to <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) with the *errMessage* constant.
	




**`<File path>: (Character string)`**

Name and full (or relative) path of file (up to 260 characters). The extension of the file can be specified. By default, if the file extension is not specified, the external file will have no extension. A UNC path can be used.

Remark: If the external file already exists (same directory and same name), this file is destroyed and re-created. To avoid deleting an existing file, use [fOpen](../WDLang1/3036036.md) associated with the *foCreateIfNotExist* constant.



**`<Creation options>: (Combination of optional constants)`**

Options for file creation: 

- Lock options: A lock can be implemented when the external file is opened: 
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *foAutomaticDeletion* | The file is locked when opened, and will be automatically deleted when closed (when [fClose](../WDLang1/3036027.md) is called, or when the application is closed).<br>If multiple applications are using the file, it will be automatically deleted when the last application closes it (when [fClose](../WDLang1/3036027.md) is called, or at the end of the application). |
| *foReadLock* | The file will be created in read-only. The other applications that use this file will not be able to read it. |
| *foWriteLock* | The file will be created in write-only. The other applications that use this file will not be able to modify it. |


	![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) The lock options are not available. The external file can be freely accessed by the other applications.




- Type of external file to create. This type is used by [fReadLine](../WDLang1/3036031.md) and [fWriteLine](../WDLang1/3036025.md) to define the type of information to read and write in the external file: 
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *foAnsi* | Ansi file. This constant is used to manage an Ansi file when the "Use Unicode strings at runtime" mode is enabled in the project configuration.<br><br>This mode is used by default in the WINDEV and WEBDEV projects. |
| *foUnicode* | Unicode file. This constant is used to manage a Unicode file when the "Use Ansi strings at runtime" mode is enabled in the project configuration.<br><br>This mode is used by default in WINDEV Mobile projects. |


	



By default, if no constant is specified: 

- the external file can be freely accessed by the other applications, 

- the type of the file corresponds to the default mode.

## Remarks


### Handling errors
<a name="handling_errors_ELTPARAGRAPHE000236"></a>

**fCreate** throws an error in the following cases:

- the file is locked by another computer or by another application, 

- the user has no write rights in the creation directory.

- a Unicode string was used for &lt;File path&gt; in an operating system such as Windows 98 or Windows Me.

### Operating mode in Windows Vista (and later)
<a name="operating_mode_windows_vista_and_later_ELTPARAGRAPHE000380"></a>

If this function does not operate properly in Windows Vista (and later), check whether the file or directory used is not in one of the system directories (Windows directory or "Program Files" directory).

**In Windows Vista (and later), with the [UAC mechanism](../Editeurs/2025014.md) (User Account Control) enabled**, you must have administrator privileges to handle and/or modify the files or directories in system directories (Windows directory or "Program Files" directory).

**Programming tip**: To handle and/or modify the files or directories without administrator privileges, you should:

- avoid writing to the Windows directory or to the "Program Files" directory, 

- use the system directory of the application (returned by [SysDir](../WDLang1/3073026.md) with the *srAppDataCommun* constant, for example).


**Remark**: In Windows Vista (and later), the virtualization mechanism is used to make the applications compatible with Vista. If the file is created in a system directory without having sufficient rights, this file will actually be created in another directory (C:\\Users\\&lt;LOGIN&gt;AppData\\Local\\VirtualStore\\Windows\\). In this case, the file cannot be shared between several applications.
