## Example


```wl
// Triggers the execution of an array of tasks and waits for the tasks to be ended
t is array of 3 ParallelTasks
t[1] = ParallelTaskExecute(Procedure1, (Param1))
t[2] = ParallelTaskExecute(Procedure1, (Param2))
t[3] = ParallelTaskExecute(Procedure1, (Param3))
...
ParallelTaskWaitAll(t)
```

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = ParallelTaskWaitAll(<Array of tasks> [, <Maximum Duration>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if all the parallel tasks are ended properly.

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if the parallel tasks are not ended properly. For example: 

	- the maximum duration has been reached.

	- one or more tasks have been canceled.







**`<Array of tasks>: (Array of ParallelTask variables)`**

Name of the Array of [ParallelTask](../WDLang1/1000021220.md) variable. 

**`<Maximum Duration>: (Optional integer)`**

Maximum duration for running the parallel tasks, expressed in hundredths of a second.

- If this parameter is specified, **ParallelTaskWaitAll** locks the application until the execution of all parallel tasks is ended or until the maximum duration is reached.

- If this parameter is not specified, **ParallelTaskWaitAll** locks the application until the execution of all parallel tasks is ended.


This parameter can correspond to: 

- an integer corresponding to the number of hundredths of a second,

- a Duration variable,

- the duration in a readable format (e.g., 1 s or 10 ms).

## Remarks
If **ParallelTaskWaitAll** is called from the main thread, none of the tasks that must be waited for must be run in the main thread. Otherwise, a lock will occur. Indeed, the main thread cannot wait for the end of tasks and run them at the same time. 

A WLanguage error signals the problem before the lock occurs.
