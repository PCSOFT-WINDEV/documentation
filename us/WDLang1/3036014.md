## Syntax

### Writing a block of bytes into an external file

`<Result> = fWrite(<File used> , <Block to write> [, <Size to write>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**



- Number of bytes written into the file. 

- -1 if an error occurred. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) with the *errMessage* constant.




**`<File used>: (Integer or DiskFile variable)`**



- Identifier of the file to use, defined by [fOpen](../WDLang1/3036036.md) or [fCreate](../WDLang1/3036017.md).

- Name of the [DiskFile](../WDLang1/1410088883.md) variable initialized with [fOpen](../WDLang1/3036036.md) or [fCreate](../WDLang1/3036017.md).
	






**`<Block to write>: (Character string)`**

Block of bytes that must be written into the file (up to 2 GB).

The format of the block of bytes is respected. No conversion is performed. 

**`<Size to write>: (Optional integer)`**

Size of the string to write (in bytes).

### Writing a memory section into an external file (fast speed)

`<Result> = fWrite(<File used> , <Address of memory section> , <Size to write>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**



- Number of bytes (characters) written into the file, 

- -1 if an error occurred. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) with the *errMessage* constant.




**`<File used>: (Integer or DiskFile variable)`**



- Identifier of the file to use, defined by [fOpen](../WDLang1/3036036.md) or [fCreate](../WDLang1/3036017.md).

- Name of the [DiskFile](../WDLang1/1410088883.md) variable initialized with [fOpen](../WDLang1/3036036.md) or [fCreate](../WDLang1/3036017.md).




**`<Address of memory section>: (Address)`**

Address of the memory section that must be written into the file.

**`<Size to write>: (Integer)`**

Size (in bytes) that must be written into the external file (up to 2 Go).
This parameter must be less than or equal to the real size of the element written into the external file. For example, if the size of the element to write is equal to 100 bytes, &lt;Size to write&gt; must be less than or equal to 100 bytes.
If this parameter is less than the real size of the written element, only the specified number of bytes will be written into the external file.

## Remarks


### Handling errors
<a name="handling_errors_ELTPARAGRAPHE000212"></a>

**fWrite** throws an error in the following cases:

- the file is not opened, 

- the file is not accessible in write mode, 

- the file is locked by another computer or by another application, 

- no disk space is available.

### Operating mode in Windows Vista (and later)
<a name="operating_mode_windows_vista_and_later_ELTPARAGRAPHE000418"></a>

If this function does not operate properly in Windows Vista (and later), check whether the file or directory used is not in one of the system directories (Windows directory or "Program Files" directory).

**In Windows Vista (and later), with the [UAC mechanism](../Editeurs/2025014.md) (User Account Control) enabled**, you must have administrator privileges to handle and/or modify the files or directories in system directories (Windows directory or "Program Files" directory).

**Programming tip**: To handle and/or modify the files or directories without administrator privileges, you should:

- avoid writing to the Windows directory or to the "Program Files" directory, 

- use the system directory of the application (returned by [SysDir](../WDLang1/3073026.md) with the *srAppDataCommun* constant, for example).


**Remark**: In Windows Vista (and later), the virtualization mechanism is used to make the applications compatible with Vista. If the file is created in a system directory without having sufficient rights, this file will actually be created in another directory (C:\\Users\\&lt;LOGIN&gt;AppData\\Local\\VirtualStore\\Windows\\). In this case, the file cannot be shared between several applications.

### Carriage Return at the end of line
<a name="carriage_return_the_end_line_ELTPARAGRAPHE000238"></a>

[fWriteLine](../WDLang1/3036025.md) is used to automatically insert a carriage return (CR) at the end of the added line. To insert a Carriage Return (CR) with **fWrite**, simply use the *CR* constant.

For example:

```wl
ResWrite = fWrite(FileID, "Report" + CR + "Sales - March 2021")
```

<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Position in the file
<a name="position_the_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000259"></a>

When opening a file, the current position corresponds to:

- the first file byte (by default), 

- the last byte of the file is the file is opened in "addition" mode (*foAdd* constant).




This position can be modified by [fSeek](../WDLang1/3036039.md).

**fWrite** writes the specified elements from the current position. Once **fWrite** has been executed, the current position is set to the last byte written.

Remark: To always read the start, you must call [fSeek](../WDLang1/3036039.md) and then [fRead](../WDLang1/3036048.md).
