Opens a modal WINDEV window.

**&lt;Window&gt;.Open** is also used to:

- set the window position,

- pass parameters to the window.




When **&lt;Window&gt;.Open** is called, the following events and actions are executed:

- the "Global declarations" event of the window,

- the "Initialization" events of the controls in the window (the order is undefined),

- the window "Initialization" event,

- the window is displayed (it becomes the current window).




For more details on the events associated with a window, see [Events associated with a window](../WDChamp/1010021.md).

**Remark**: The controls in the previous window are disabled.



![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) In Java, modal windows appear in the taskbar.

**Mobile platforms**: 

- **iOS and UWP**: **&lt;Window&gt;.Open** is not available. Use [&lt;Window&gt;.OpenMobileWindow](../WDLang1/1000023887.md) instead.

- **Android**: Using **&lt;Window&gt;.Open** in Android is not recommended. We recommend that you use [&lt;Window&gt;.OpenMobileWindow](../WDLang1/1000023887.md). If it is necessary to process the value returned by the window, use the "Close a child window" event of the calling window.




![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png)![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) This function is available only to simplify the Webification of WINDEV projects. In a WEBDEV site, this function has the same behavior as [&lt;Page&gt;.DisplayDialog](../WDLang2/1000021663.md).

## Example


```wl
// Open and reposition the "WIN_Edit" window
// The Value1 and Value2 parameters are passed to the event
// "Global declarations" of "WIN_Edit"
// ReturnedValue will retrieve the returned value
// when the "WIN_Edit" window is closed
ReturnedValue = WIN_Edit.Open(Value1, Value2)

## Syntax

`<Result> = <Window>.Open([<Parameter 1> [... [, <Parameter N>]]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Type corresponding to the retrieved value (optional))`**

Value returned by the popup window when it is closed. This value is returned:

- by the [RETURN](../Motscles/1510007.md) keyword in the window "Close" event,

- by the [Close](../WDLang1/3038018.md) function,

- by the [ReturnedValue](../Proprietes/2510134.md) property used before closing the window.




**`<Window>: (Window name)`**

Name of the window to be opened.

By default, the window is displayed according to the position defined in the editor. 

**`<Parameter 1>: (Type of value sent to the window (optional))`**

First parameter that will be passed to the "Global declarations" event of the window to open. This parameter is passed by reference and is considered as a variable global to the window.



**`<Parameter N>: (Type of value sent to the window (optional))`**

Nth parameter that must be passed to the "Global declarations" event of the window to open. This parameter is passed by reference and is considered as a variable global to the window.

## Remarks


### Parameters passed to the window to open
<a name="parameters_passed_the_window_open_ELTPARAGRAPHE000314"></a>

The parameters are retrieved in the "Global declarations" event of the window. Simply write the following line of code at the start of the event:

```txt
PROCEDURE <Window name>(<Parameter1> [, <Parameter2> [, ...]])
```

For more details, see [Window with parameters](../WDChamp/1010026.md).


<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Window opening mode
<a name="window_opening_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000340"></a>

The window is opened in modal mode:

- the result of **&lt;Window&gt;.Open** will be known once the window is closed,

- the user will not be able to click in one of the parent windows of the current window.




To manage modeless windows, use [&lt;Page&gt;.OpenChild](../WDLang1/1000023904.md) or [OpenSister](../WDLang1/3038045.md).

To manage MDI, use [&lt;Window&gt;.MDIOpen](../WDLang1/3052007.md).
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Number of opened windows
<a name="number_opened_windows_ELTPARAGRAPHE000372"></a>

The number of windows that can be opened simultaneously depends on the available memory.
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Closing a window
<a name="closing_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000382"></a>

A window opened with **&lt;Window&gt;.Open** can be closed with [Close](../WDLang1/3038018.md) (without parameters) from any event associated with the window or a control in the window.

If a parent window is closed, its child windows are also closed.
<a name="NOTE0_5"></a>


### Title of the window to be opened
<a name="title_the_window_opened_ELTPARAGRAPHE000399"></a>

By default, the window title is the one defined in the editor.

To change the window title, use [NextTitle](../WDLang1/3038043.md) or [CurrentTitle](../WDLang1/3038023.md).

### Minimized window
<a name="minimized_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000419"></a>

If the current window is minimized, the entire project is minimized.

The displayed icon is:

- the one of the current window if the current window has an icon, 

- the one of the current project if the current window has no icon.

### Opening the window of a component
<a name="opening_the_window_component_ELTPARAGRAPHE000434"></a>To open the window of a component, simply use the name of the component window (component included in the project). For example:

```wl
ComponentWindow.Open()
```
If a conflict occurs with a project element, the name of the element must be prefixed by the name of the component. For example:

```wl
MyComponent.Window.Open()
```
To use the name of the window in a variable, specify the name of the component. For example:

```wl
sWindow is string = "MyComponent.MyWindow"
sWindow.Open()
```


<a name="XComponent"></a>

## Component:
wd280obj.dll
