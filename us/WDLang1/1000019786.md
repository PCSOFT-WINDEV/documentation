## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000176"></a>
The Gesture variable is used to retrieve the gesture parameters (swipe): direction, speed, distance, ...

This variable can be used: 

- in the swipe event of elements in a Looper control, to know the swipe direction. 

- in multitouch events (zoom, scroll and swipe) to avoid declaring parameters in the events.

The Gesture variable includes the following elements:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
|   | Real<br><br>Angle (expressed in degrees) corresponding to the inclination of an Apple Pencil in relation to the tablet plan.<br><br>This variable is filled in the event "Pressed/Left button down" only. |
|   | Real<br><br>Azimuth angle (expressed in degrees) of an Apple Pencil in relation to the mark of current control.<br><br>This variable is filled in the event "Pressed/Left button down" only. |
|   | Integer constant<br><br>Direction of the gesture. Can correspond to one of the following constants:<br><br>- *BottomToTop*: Swipe from bottom to top.<br><br>- *RightToLeft*: Swipe from right to left.<br><br>- *LeftToRight*: Swipe from left to right.<br><br>- *TopToBottom*: Swipe from top to bottom.<br><br><br>This variable is filled in Scroll and Swipe events. |
|   | For a scroll: value of the move (in pixels) in the direction specified by Gesture.Direction.<br><br>For a pinch zoom gesture: value of the spacing (in pixels) between two contact points.<br><br>This variable is filled in Scroll and Pinch zoom events. |
|   | Real<br><br>Pressure during a press.<br><br>This pressure can take a value included between 0,0 and 1,0.<br><br>This variable is filled in the event "Pressed/Left button down" only. |
|   | Real<br><br>Maximum pressure during a press.<br><br>This pressure can take a value included between 0,0 and 1,0.<br><br>This variable is filled in the event "Pressed/Left button down" only. |
|   | Integer<br><br>Speed of the move in the direction specified by Gesture.Direction. <br>This speed is expressed in pixels per second.<br><br>This variable is filled in Swipe events. |

```wl
// Scroll with Finger event of IMG_Image
SWITCH Gesture.Direction
	CASE RightToLeft: RADIO_Direction = 1
	CASE LeftToRight: RADIO_Direction = 2
	CASE TopToBottom: RADIO_Direction = 3
	CASE BottomToTop: RADIO_Direction = 4
END

EDT_Speed = Gesture.Speed
EDT_Distance = Gesture.Distance
