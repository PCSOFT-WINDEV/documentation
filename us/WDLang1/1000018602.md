Applies a difference buffer to a specific buffer. The difference buffer was created by [diffCreate](../WDLang1/1000018601.md). 

This function can be useful when updating a file by Internet: all you have to do is send the difference file and apply it when it is received.

## Example


```wl
MySourceString is string = "abcde"
MyEndString is string = "abcdef"
MyDifferenceBuffer is Buffer 
MyDifferenceBuffer = diffCreate(MySourceString, MyEndString, diffText)
MyDecodeBuffer is Buffer
MyDecodeBuffer = diffApply(MySourceString, MyDifferenceBuffer)
// MyDecodeBuffer = MyEndString
```



```wl
SourceBuffer is Buffer
EndBuffer is Buffer
// Load the buffers
// ..
MyDifferenceBuffer is Buffer
MyDifferenceBuffer = diffCreate(SourceBuffer, EndBuffer, diffBinary)
MyDecodeBuffer is Buffer
MyDecodeBuffer = diffApply(SourceBuffer, MyDifferenceBuffer)
```

## Syntax

`<Result> = diffApply(<Buffer to process> , <Difference buffer>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Buffer variable)`**

Result once the difference buffer has been applied. This result can correspond to: 

- the new buffer searched. 

- an empty buffer if an error occurred. In this case, the [ErrorOccurred](../WDLang1/3087001.md) variable is set to <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>. 




**`<Buffer to process>: (Buffer variable)`**

Name of buffer to process. 

**`<Difference buffer>: (Buffer variable)`**

Name of the difference buffer that must be applied to &lt;Buffer to process&gt;. This buffer was created by [diffCreate](../WDLang1/1000018601.md).

## Remarks


### Error cases
<a name="error_cases_ELTPARAGRAPHE000078"></a>

Applying the difference buffer may fail in the following cases: 

- The difference buffer does not use a recognized format. 

- &lt;Buffer to process&gt; is not the buffer from which the difference buffer was created. 

- The result does not correspond to the buffer that must be found (internal check).
