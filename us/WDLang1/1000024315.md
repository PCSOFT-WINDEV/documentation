Deletes the duplicates from an array.

The following arrays can be handled:

- One-dimensional array of simple elements.

- Two-dimensional array of simple elements. Duplicates are deleted according to the value of one or more columns.

- One-dimensional array of classes or structures. Duplicates are deleted according to the value of one or more members.

- One-dimensional array by providing a comparison procedure.




Remark: [&lt;Array&gt;.Distinct](../WDLang1/1000025406.md) is used to obtain a new array without duplicates.

## Example


```wl
arrMyArray is array of int = [ 1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 2, 6 ]
// arrMyArray contains [ 1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 2, 6 ]

arrMyArray.DeleteDuplicate()
// arrMyArray contains [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ]
```


<a name="Example2"></a>

```wl
// Use with an array of structures
StACategory is Structure
	CODE_CATEGORY is string(5)
	CATEGORY is string(300)
END
arrTheCategories is array of StACategory

// Code for filling the array
...

// Delete the duplicates
arrTheCategories.DeleteDuplicate(asMember, "CODE_CATEGORY;CATEGORY")
```

### Deleting the duplicates from a one-dimensional array of simple elements

`<WLanguage array>.DeleteDuplicate([<Deletion options>])`
---

**`<WLanguage array>: (Array)`**

Name of the Array variable to use. This array must be a one-dimensional array. 

This array can also correspond to an array of simple elements of an advanced variable ("Group" array in the [gglContact](../WDLang5/1000017434.md) variables for example).

**`<Deletion options>: (Optional integer constant)`**

Deletion options corresponding to one or more constants:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *tccIgnoreAccent* | Delete duplicates ignoring accents.<br>This option is useful for arrays of strings.<br> |
| *tccIgnoreCase* | Delete duplicates ignoring case.<br>This option is useful for the arrays of character strings. |
| *tccIgnoreInsideSpace* | Delete duplicates ignoring spaces inside strings.<br>This option is useful for the arrays of character strings. |
| *tccIgnorePonctuationAndSpace* | Delete duplicates ignoring spaces and punctuation.<br>This option is useful for arrays of strings.<br> |
| *tccIgnoreSpace* | Delete duplicates ignoring the spaces at the beginning and at the end of strings.<br>This option is useful for the arrays of character strings. |

### Deleting duplicates from a two-dimensional array of simple elements according to one or more columns

`<WLanguage array>.DeleteDuplicate(<asColumn> , <Column>)`
---

**`<WLanguage array>: (Array)`**

Name of the Array variable to use. This array must be a two-dimensional array.

This array can also correspond to a two-dimensional array of an advanced type (for example, deleting duplicates from an [xlsDocument](../WDLang5/1000018782.md) variable according to the column value).

**`<asColumn>: (Constant)`**

*asColumn*: Constant used to handle a two-dimensional array of simple elements according to several columns.

The *asColumn* constant can be combined with one or more options for deletion:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *tccIgnoreAccent* | Delete duplicates ignoring accents.<br>This option is applied to all the columns according to which the deletion of duplicates is performed.<br>This option is useful for arrays of strings.<br> |
| *tccIgnoreCase* | Delete duplicates ignoring case.<br>This option is applied to all the columns according to which the deletion of duplicates is performed.<br>This option is useful for the arrays of character strings. |
| *tccIgnoreInsideSpace* | Delete duplicates ignoring spaces inside strings.<br>This option is applied to all the columns according to which the deletion of duplicates is performed.<br>This option is useful for the arrays of character strings. |
| *tccIgnorePonctuationAndSpace* | Delete duplicates ignoring spaces and punctuation.<br>This option is applied to all the columns according to which the deletion of duplicates is performed.<br>This option is useful for the arrays of character strings.<br><br> |
| *tccIgnoreSpace* | Delete duplicates ignoring the spaces at the beginning and at the end of strings.<br>This option is applied to all the columns according to which the deletion of duplicates is performed.<br>This option is useful for the arrays of character strings. |



**`<Column>: (Integer or character string)`**



- If a single column must be taken into account, subscript of the column that must be taken into account for the deletion of duplicates. 

- If several columns must be taken into account, list of columns that must be taken into account for the deletion of duplicates. The different columns must be separated by a semicolon.

### Deleting the duplicates from a one-dimensional array of classes, structures or advanced types

`<WLanguage array>.DeleteDuplicate(<asMember> , <Members>)`
---

**`<WLanguage array>: (Array)`**

Name of the Array variable to use. This array must be a one-dimensional array. This array can be an array of classes, structures or advanced types.

**`<asMember>: (Constant)`**

*asMember*: Constant used to handle a one-dimensional array of classes, structures or advanced types.

The *asMember* constant can be combined with one or more options for deletion:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *tccIgnoreAccent* | Delete duplicates ignoring accents.<br>This option is applied to all the members according to which the deletion of duplicates is performed.<br>This option is useful for the "character string" members.<br> |
| *tccIgnoreCase* | Delete duplicates ignoring case.<br>This option is applied to all the members according to which the deletion of duplicates is performed.<br>This option is useful for the "character string" members. |
| *tccIgnoreInsideSpace* | Delete duplicates ignoring spaces inside strings.<br>This option is applied to all the members according to which the deletion of duplicates is performed.<br>This option is useful for the "character string" members. |
| *tccIgnorePonctuationAndSpace* | Delete duplicates ignoring spaces and punctuation.<br>This option is applied to all the members according to which the deletion of duplicates is performed.<br>This option is useful for the "character string" members.<br> |
| *tccIgnoreSpace* | Delete duplicates ignoring the spaces at the beginning and at the end of strings.<br>This option is applied to all the members according to which the deletion of duplicates is performed.<br>This option is useful for the "character string" members. |



**`<Members>: (Character string)`**

Name of members used. If the deletion of duplicates is performed according to the value of several members, their names must be separated by semicolons.


<a name="SYNTAX4"></a>

### Deleting duplicates in a one-dimensional array with a comparison procedure

`<WLanguage array>.DeleteDuplicate(<asFunction> , <Custom WLanguage procedure>)`
---

**`<WLanguage array>: (Array)`**

Name of the Array variable to use. This array must be a one-dimensional array. 

This array can be an array of advanced types.

**`<asFunction>: (Constant)`**

*asFunction*: Constant used to handle a one-dimensional array with a sort procedure.

**`<Custom WLanguage procedure>: (Character string)`**

WLanguage procedure in the following format: 


```txt
PROCEDURE <Procedure name>(<Element1>, <Element2>)
```
This procedure is automatically called by the deletion mechanism to compare the elements between themselves, two by two.

- If the element 1 must be found before the element 2 in the sort order, the procedure must return -1.

- If the element 1 must be found after the element 2 in the sort order, the procedure must return 1.

- If element 1 and element 2 are identical, the procedure must return 0.

<a name="NOTE0_1"></a>

## Remarks


- This function is not available for the fixed arrays.

- This function can be used on the arrays of advanced variables. 

- Dynamic array of variants: Only a custom deletion (with a WLanguage procedure) can be used.
