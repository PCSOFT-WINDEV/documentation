Cancels the last action performed by the end user when modifying the interface (Mode "UI modification by end user" enabled). This function is equivalent to an "Undo" (Ctrl + Z) performed by the user. 

This function is mainly used when creating an editor through programming (see "Remarks").

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`WinEdUndo(<Window>)`
---

**`<Window>: (Window name)`**

Name of window or internal window to use. This window must be in modification mode ([WinEdActive](../WDLang1/1000021843.md)).

## Remarks


### Use conditions
<a name="use_conditions_ELTPARAGRAPHE000037"></a>

- **WinEdUndo** has no effect if there is no action to cancel.

- If the last action is a custom action run by [WinEdDo](../WDLang1/1000021897.md), the procedure defined by [WinEdDeclareUndo](../WDLang1/1000021898.md) is run.

- The canceled action can be restored: 

	- by Ctrl + Y,

	- through programming with [WinEdRedo](../WDLang1/1000021905.md).

### Use example
<a name="use_example_ELTPARAGRAPHE000060"></a>

[WinEdDo](../WDLang1/1000021897.md) is used to create custom actions (control creation for example) that support the undo/redo feature.

Let's take a simple example: creating a graphic object editor. 
 
A button is used to create a shape. The user must have the ability to cancel the shape creation. The following operations are performed: 

- The window switches to edit mode ([WinEdActive](../WDLang1/1000021843.md)). 

- The [WinEdDo](../WDLang1/1000021897.md) function is called. The procedure called by this function is used to create the shape. This procedure also contains the call to [WinEdDeclareUndo](../WDLang1/1000021898.md). [WinEdDeclareUndo](../WDLang1/1000021898.md) is used to define the behavior in case of user cancellation. 

- The window switches to standard mode ([WinEdActive](../WDLang1/1000021843.md)). 




The end user can undo this action (Ctrl + Z or call to **WinEdUndo**) and eventually redo it (Ctrl + Y or call to [WinEdRedo](../WDLang1/1000021905.md)).
