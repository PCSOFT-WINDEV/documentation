## Example


```wl
// Initialize a Unicode string containing 260 characters
WallPaper is Unicode string
WallPaper = AnsiToUnicode(RepeatString(" ", 260))

// Declare a COMObject variable
ActiveDesktop is COMObject

// Retrieve the interface for handling the desktop
ActiveDesktop = COMCreateInstance("75048700-EF1F-11D0-9888-006097DEACF9", ...
		"F490EB00-1240-11D1-9888-006097DEACF9")
IF ErrorOccurred = False THEN
	// Retrieve the image of the desktop wallpaper
	COMCallMethod(ActiveDesktop, 4, &WallPaper, 260, 1)

	Info("The image of the desktop is: " + UnicodeToAnsi(WallPaper))
END

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = COMCallMethod(<COM Object> , <Method number> [, <Parameter 1> [... [, <Parameter N>]]])`
---

**`<Result>: (4-byte integer in 32 bits, 8-byte integer in 64 bits)`**

Result of method execution. This result can be an error code. 
The type of this result depends on the method run. For more details, see the documentation about the method. 
The method result will not be retrieved if its size exceeds the size of the integer defined for the platform.

**`<COM Object>: (COMObject variable)`**

Interface of COM object returned by [COMCreateInstance](../WDLang1/1000018831.md).

**`<Method number>: (Integer)`**

Order number of method in the table of virtual methods. 

**CAUTION**:

- the order number takes the base classes into account

- the order number starts from 0.




**`<Parameter 1>: (Type corresponding to the parameter)`**

First parameter that will be passed to the method. These parameters and the parameters expected by the method must have the same type. Can be used: 

- the "simple" types (see the Notes),

- the structures (see the Notes),

- a name of WLanguage procedure. This procedure will be called by the method (see the Notes).






**`<Parameter N>: (Type corresponding to the parameter)`**

Nth parameter that will be passed to the method. These parameters and the parameters expected by the method must have the same type. Can be used: 

- the "simple" types (see the Notes),

- the structures (see the Notes),

- a name of WLanguage procedure. This procedure will be called by the method (see the Notes).

## Remarks




### Checks performed
<a name="checks_performed_ELTPARAGRAPHE000064"></a>

**COMCallMethod** is protected against the "General protection faults" in the method called. Nevertheless, a WLanguage error is triggered if this type of error occurs.
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>




### Managing errors
<a name="managing_errors_ELTPARAGRAPHE000074"></a>

When running methods, if the result returned corresponds to an error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) (associated with the *errSystemCode* or *errSystemMessage* constant) to get more details on the error.
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>




### Parameters that must be passed to the method of the COM object
<a name="parameters_that_must_passed_the_method_the_com_object_ELTPARAGRAPHE000085"></a>

These parameters and the parameters expected by the method must have the same type.

The available types are as follows:

- The "simple" types (integer, real and boolean). Using another WLanguage type triggers a WLanguage error. 
	If the method to run expects a Windows pointer or handle, use a [system integer](../Motscles/1514049.md). 
	If the method to run expects an address, use [the & operator](../Motscles/1512002.md).

- The "string" types. 

- The structure types.

- A name of WLanguage procedure. This procedure will be called by the method of the COM object (see the paragraph below). 
	The parameters depend on the method run. See the documentation about this method for more details.

### Passing a string to a method of COM object or retrieving a string after the call to a method of COM object
<a name="passing_string_method_com_object_retrieving_string_after_the_call_method_com_object_ELTPARAGRAPHE000112"></a>

1. In input parameter, use the string type. For example:
	
	```txt
	sString is string 
	COMCallMethod(<Object>, <Method number>, sString)
	```


2. In output parameter, the C language cannot easily manage the dynamic strings. Therefore, you must:

	- define a maximum size, with the "String on" type. For example:
			
		```txt
		sString is string on 100
		COMCallMethod(<Object>, <Method number>, sString) 
		// in Method in C: 
		// strncpy(PointerInC, "Test", 100)
		```


	- retrieve the addresses of strings in C (however, in this case, the code section in C must "preserve" the strings returned), then transfer the string into a string variable with [StringRetrieve](../WDLang1/3024005.md). For example:
			
		```txt
		nStringAddress is system int
		COMCallMethod(<Object>, <Method number>, &nStringAddress)
		sString is string
		sString = StringRetrieve(nStringAddress, srASCIIZAddress)
		// in Method in C: *PointerInC = "Test"
		```





3. In return value, retrieve the addresses of strings in C (however, in this case, the code section in C must "preserve" the strings returned), then transfer the string into a string variable with [StringRetrieve](../WDLang1/3024005.md). For example:
	
	```txt
	nStringAddress is system int
	nStringAddress = COMCallMethod(<Object>, <Method number>)
	sString is string
	sString = StringRetrieve(nStringAddress, srASCIIZAddress)
	// in Method in C: Return PointerInC
	```

### Passing a structure containing a string to a method of COM object
<a name="passing_structure_containing_string_method_com_object_ELTPARAGRAPHE000139"></a>

1. In input, the following code must be used: 
	
	```txt
	Struct is structure
		sString is string
	END
	AStruct is Struct
	COMCallMethod(<Object>, <Method number>, &AStruct)
	```


2. In output, the C language does not easily manage the dynamic strings. Therefore, you must:

	- define a maximum size and perform a copy into the WLanguage memory. For example:
			
		```txt
		sString is string on 100
		Struct is structure
			aString is int
		END
		AStruct is Struct
		AStruct:aString = &sString
		COMCallMethod(<Object>, <Method number>, &AStruct) 
		// in Method in C: 
		// strncpy(StructInC->PointerInC, "Test", 100)
		```


	- retrieve the address of strings in C (however, in this case, the code section in C must "preserve " the strings returned). For example:
			
		```txt
		sString is string
		Struct is structure
			aString is int
		END
		AStruct is Struct
		COMCallMethod(<Object>, <Method number>, &AStruct)
		sString = StringRetrieve(AStruct:aString, srASCIIZAddress)
		// in Method in C: StructInC->PointerInC = "Test"
		```

### Procedure called in CallBack 
<a name="procedure_called_callback_ELTPARAGRAPHE000157"></a>

Some methods expect the address of a "Callback" procedure as parameter: this procedure will be recalled by the method of the COM object.  

To use a callback procedure in WLanguage:

**1.** Create the callback procedure in your project
To retrieve the parameters, you must exactly describe the parameters expected by the "CallBack" function. Otherwise, "general protection faults" may occur.

```txt
PROCEDURE <Procedure name> (<Param1> is <Type1>,<Param2> is <Type2>)
```


**Remarks**:

- The types must correspond to the ones described in the documentation of the COM object.

- The parameters must necessarily be passed by value. To retrieve a parameter by reference:

	1. Use an integer.

	2. With [Transfer](../WDLang1/3014015.md), retrieve or assign the real value.







**2.** Modify the call to the method accordingly. Use the following syntax:

```txt
COMCallMethod(<Object>, <Method number>, &<Name of CallBack procedure>)
```

### Miscellaneous
<a name="miscellaneous_ELTPARAGRAPHE000189"></a>

- **COMCallMethod** does not block other threads.

- If the method called modifies the regional system parameters, the previous regional parameters are restored.




[APIParameter](../WDLang1/3014026.md) is used to configure the default behavior of this function.
