The following functions are used to manage encryption and compression:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [Compress](../WDLang1/3024012.md) | Compresses a string or a memory block (buffer) in binary format. |
| [Decode](../WDLang1/1000022259.md) | Decodes a character string that was encoded by [Encode](../WDLang1/1000022258.md). |
| [Decrypt](../WDLang1/3024035.md) | Decrypts a character string that was encrypted by [Encrypt](../WDLang1/3024014.md). |
| [DecryptAsymmetric](../WDLang1/1000024050.md) | Decrypts a buffer with a private/public key algorithm with RSA encryption. |
| [DecryptAsymmetricEnveloped](../WDLang1/1000024058.md) | Performs the asymmetric encryption of an envelope that has been encrypted with [EncrypteAsymmetricEnveloped](../WDLang1/1000024057.md). |
| [DecryptStandard](../WDLang1/1000021294.md) | Decrypts a message that was encrypted with a symmetrical encryption algorithm (AES, DES, etc.). |
| [Encode](../WDLang1/1000022258.md) | Encodes a character string or a buffer. To decode the result, simply use [Decode](../WDLang1/1000022259.md). |
| [Encrypt](../WDLang1/3024014.md) | Encrypts a character string in binary format or in ASCII format. |
| [EncryptAsymmetric](../WDLang1/1000024049.md) | Encrypts a buffer using an asymmetric encryption algorithm (RSA) that requires a public key and a private key. |
| [EncryptAsymmetricEnveloped](../WDLang1/1000024057.md) | Performs an asymmetric encryption of an envelope. |
| [EncryptGenerateRSAKey](../WDLang1/1000024052.md) | Generates an RSA private/public key pair. |
| [EncryptStandard](../WDLang1/1000021293.md) | Encrypts a character string or a binary buffer by using a symmetrical encryption algorithm (AES, DES, etc.) |
| [LuhnCalculate](../WDLang1/1410087276.md) | Calculates the next Luhn check digit for a given sequence. |
| [LuhnCheck](../WDLang1/1410087277.md) | Checks that the given sequence is valid according to the Luhn formula. |
| [Uncompress](../WDLang1/3024009.md) | Decompresses a memory block (buffer) that was compressed by [Compress](../WDLang1/3024012.md). |
| [UUDecode](../WDLang1/1000018864.md) | Decodes a character string in UUEncode format. |
| [UUEncode](../WDLang1/1000018862.md) | Encodes a character string according to the UUEncode algorithm. |
