```wl
MyCertificate is Certificate

// Open the certificate picker of Windows
MyCertificate = CertificateSelect()

// Cancellation or error
IF MyCertificate.Name = "" THEN
	RETURN
END

// Checks whether the selected certificate is valid for signing
IF MyCertificate.ValidForSignature = False THEN
	Info("The selected certificate cannot be used to generate a signature.")
	RETURN
END

// Retrieve the buffer containing the signature
bufSignature is Buffer
bufSignature = CertificateSignFile(FullFileName, MyCertificate)

// Save the signature in a file for a future check
fSaveBuffer(MySignatureFile, bufSignature)

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = CertificateSignFile(<File path> , <Certificate> [, <Signature file>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Buffer)`**

Signature of the file. This buffer can be used later by [CertificateCheckBufferSignatureFile](../WDLang1/1000019500.md) to check the correspondence between the signature and the file.

**`<File path>: (Character string)`**

Name and full (or relative) path of the file for which a signature will be created.

**`<Certificate>: (Certificate variable)`**

Name of [Certificate](../WDLang1/1000019287.md) variable containing the certificate that will be used to create the signature of the file.

**`<Signature file>: (Optional character string)`**

Name and full (or relative) path of the file containing the signature. This file can be used later by [CertificateCheckFileSignatureFile](../WDLang1/1000019499.md) to check the correspondence between the signature and the file.

## Remarks


### Validity of certificate
<a name="validity_certificate_ELTPARAGRAPHE000049"></a>

Before signing a file, it is recommended to check the validity of the certificate (**ValidForSignature** property of the [Certificate](../WDLang1/1000019287.md) variable). This property is used to find out whether the certificate owns a private key as well as all the characteristics required to perform a signature. **CertificateSignFile** returns an error if this property is set to <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>.
