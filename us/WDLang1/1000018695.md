## Example


```wl
// Start a remote application (advanced use)
AppToStart is Process
AppToStart.Executable = "myapp.exe"
AppToStart.CommandLine = "/SILENT"
AppToStart.ExecutionLogin = "DOMAIN\USER"
AppToStart.ExecutionPassword = "mypassword"

ExeRemoteRun(AppToStart, exeReturnValue, "COMPUTER2")
WHILE AppToStart.ExecutionInProgress = True
	Wait(100)
END

Trace(AppToStart.ReturnValue)
```

## Syntax

### Starting a remote application with the current user account

`<Result> = ExeRemoteRun(<Command line> , <Element to return> , <Address of Remote Computer> [, <Username> [, <Connection password>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**

Corresponds to the information requested by &lt;Element to return&gt;: 

- if the *exeReturnValue* constant was specified, &lt;Result&gt; corresponds to the return code specified by the [RETURN statement](../Motscles/1510007.md). 

- if the *exePID* constant was specified, &lt;Result&gt; corresponds to the identifier of process of application run (PID).




**`<Command line>: (Character string)`**

Command line to run. The specified application must be installed on the remote computer. The paths used in this command line must be valid on the remote computer.

**`<Element to return>: (Integer constant)`**

Configures the function result:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *exePID* | The current program and the launched program run in parallel. &lt;Result&gt; corresponds to the identifier of created process (also called PID) if the executable was successfully run, 0 if an error occurred. |
| *exeReturnValue* | The current program resumes its execution when the program run is over. &lt;Result&gt; is the return value of the executable.<br><br>**Caution**: The remote application must be run in less than one hour. Otherwise, the value returned after an hour will be 0. |



**`<Address of Remote Computer>: (Character string)`**

IP address of server in xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx format (returned by [NetIPAddress](../WDLang3/3056023.md)) or name of server (returned by [NetMachineName](../WDLang3/3056014.md)).

**`<Username>: (Optional character string)`**

Username that will be used to connect to the remote computer. This parameter has the following format: "Domain\\User". 
The current user account is used if this parameter is not specified. 

**`<Connection password>: (Optional character string)`**

Password associated with &lt;Username&gt;.
This parameter is mandatory if &lt;Username&gt; is specified.

### Starting a remote application (advanced use)

`<Result> = ExeRemoteRun(<Process> , <Element to return> , <Address of Remote Computer> [, <Username> [, <Connection password>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**

Corresponds to the information requested by &lt;Element to return&gt;: 

- if the *exeReturnValue* constant was specified, &lt;Result&gt; corresponds to the return code specified by the [RETURN statement](../Motscles/1510007.md). 

- if the *exePID* constant was specified, &lt;Result&gt; corresponds to the identifier of process of application run (PID).




**`<Process>: (Process variable)`**

[Process](../WDLang1/1000018696.md) variable used to describe the characteristics of the application to run.

**`<Element to return>: (Integer constant)`**

Configures the function result:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *exePID* | The current program and the launched program run in parallel. &lt;Result&gt; corresponds to the identifier of created process (also called PID) if the executable was successfully run, 0 if an error occurred. |
| *exeReturnValue* | The current program resumes its execution when the program run is over. &lt;Result&gt; is the return value of the executable.<br><br>**Caution**: The remote application must be run in less than one hour. Otherwise, the value returned after an hour will be 0. |



**`<Address of Remote Computer>: (Character string)`**

IP address of server in xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx format (returned by [NetIPAddress](../WDLang3/3056023.md)) or name of server (returned by [NetMachineName](../WDLang3/3056014.md)).

**`<Username>: (Optional character string)`**
