## Remarks


### Characteristics of the popup window
<a name="characteristics_the_popup_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000054"></a>

- The window is automatically closed when it loses focus or during the call to [Close](../WDLang1/3038018.md). The current value is returned to the control that opened the popup window by one of the following methods:

	- by the [RETURN](../Motscles/1510007.md) keyword in the "Closing" event associated with the window,

	- by the [Close](../WDLang1/3038018.md) function,

	- by the [ReturnedValue](../Proprietes/2510134.md) property used before closing the window.




- The style of the popup windows is applied to the window opened by **OpenPopup**. If a title bar was defined in the editor, this title bar is reduced and the window cannot be maximized or minimized.

- The popup window is opened below the control that calls **OpenPopup**. If there is not enough space to open the window, the window will be opened either above the control, or below the control to the left.

### Parameters passed to the window to open
<a name="parameters_passed_the_window_open_ELTPARAGRAPHE000083"></a>The parameters are retrieved in the event "Global declarations" of the window. The first line of code of this event must correspond to the following line:


```txt
PROCEDURE <Window name> (<Parameter1> [, <Parameter2> [, ...]])
```


For more details, see [Window with parameters](../WDChamp/1010026.md).


<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Limitations
<a name="limitations_ELTPARAGRAPHE000106"></a>

- **OpenPopup** must be executed from the code of a control.

- The control that calls **OpenPopup** must be visible.

- Non-modal windows cannot be opened from a popup window. [Open](../WDLang1/3038035.md) must be used to open a window. Opening a modal window from a popup window does not automatically close the popup window. In this case, you must process the return value of [Open](../WDLang1/3038035.md) and you must use [Close](../WDLang1/3038018.md) to close the popup window.

- A popup window cannot be opened from another popup window.
