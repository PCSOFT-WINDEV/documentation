## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000260"></a>
The Service variable is used to:

- configure the parameters for installing the service (used by [ServiceInstall](../WDLang1/1000017099.md)).

- retrieve the parameters of a service ([ServiceInfo](../WDLang1/1000017103.md)).

- modify the parameters of a service ([ServiceModify](../WDLang1/1000017100.md)).

## Service variable
<a name="service_variable_ELTTEXTE000284"></a>
The Service variable includes the following elements:

| Element | Type | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Service.Startup | Integer constant | Service start mode:<br><br>- *serviceStartupAutomatic*: Automatic startup once the system is initialized.<br><br>- *serviceStartupDisabled*: The service is disabled. Any attempt to start it triggers an error.<br><br>- *serviceStartupManual*: Manual start (with [ServiceStart](../WDLang1/1000017110.md) for example).<br><br>- *serviceStartupSystem*: Automatic start at the same time as the operating system (used by the drivers).<br><br><br> |
| Service.DelayedStartup | Boolean | Specifies that the service will not be started immediately when the system starts but a little bit later.<br><br>![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png) **Remarks**:<br><br>- This element is only taken into account for Windows services.<br><br>- This element is only taken into account starting with Windows Vista.<br><br><br> |
| Service.Description | Character string | Description of the service.<br><br>![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png) **Remark**: This information appears in the "Full name" item of the service manager. |
| Service.LongDescription | Character string | Detailed description of the service.<br><br>![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png) **Remark**: this information appears in the "Description" item of the service manager. |
| Service.StartupError | Integer constant | The errors that occurred when starting a service are processed by Windows (for the services with automatic start):<br><br>- *serviceErrorCritical*: The system writes the start service failure in the event observer log and restarts in "Last proper configuration known" mode.<br><br>- *serviceErrorSerious*: The system writes the start service failure in the event observer log and restarts in "Last proper configuration known" mode if it is not already is that mode.<br><br>- *serviceErrorIgnore*: The system performs no action if the service does not start.<br><br>- *serviceErrorLog*: The system writes the start service failure in the event observer log.<br><br><br> |
| Service.CommandLine | Character string | Full command line of the service (path of the executable and parameters). |
| Service.Type | Integer constant | Type of the service:<br><br>- *serviceTypeInteractiveShared*: Service allowed to interact with the desktop and sharing its process with other services.<br><br>- *serviceTypeInteractiveSimple*: Service allowed to interact with the desktop and operating on its own in its process.<br><br>- *serviceTypeShared*: Standard service sharing its process with other services.<br><br>- *serviceTypeDriverKernel*: Driver of the kernel.<br><br>- *serviceTypeDriverFileSystem*: Driver of file system.<br><br>- *serviceTypeSimple*: Standard service operating on its own in its process.<br><br><br> |
| Service.User | Character string or String constant | User account that will run the service or one of the following constants:<br><br>- *AccountLocalService*: Local account that has the recommended rights to run a service. On the network, this account will be considered as guest. This constant is available in modification only ([ServiceModify](../WDLang1/1000017100.md)).<br><br>- *AccountNetworkService*: Local account that has the recommended rights to run a service. On the network, this account will have the rights of the current computer.<br><br>- *AccountLocalSystem*: Local account representing the operating system. This account has all the rights. On the network, this account will have the rights of the current computer.<br>	This constant corresponds to the "LocalSystem" account.<br><br><br>**Remark**: Accounts identified via the *AccountLocalService*,*AccountNetworkService* and *AccountLocalSystem* constants do not have a password. |
| Service.Password | Character string | Password of the user account |





**Remark**: If a service is allowed to interact with the desktop (*serviceTypeInteractiveShared* or *serviceTypeInteractiveSimple*), its user account must be set to *AccountLocalSystem*. The other values will be ignored. Services authorized to interact with the desktop are not available since Windows Vista.

![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png) From Windows 2000, additional elements are available to manage the service failures. A service failure is an executable stoppage following a fatal error. In Windows NT and Linux, these elements are ignored.

| Element | Type | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Service.NbActionOnFailure | Integer | Number of elements in the Service.ActionOnFailure and Service.TimeoutBeforeActionOnFailure arrays.<br><br>- At the first failure of the service, the action specified in Service.ActionOnFailure[1] is run.<br><br>- At the Nth failure of the service, the action specified in Service.ActionOnFailure[n] is run. If the array contains less than n elements, the last action described is repeated for all the following failures.<br><br><br> |
| Service.ActionOnFailure | Array of Integer constants | Action performed if the service fails:<br><br>- *serviceFailureIgnore*: the failure of the service is ignored, the service stops.<br><br>- *serviceFailureStartApp*: the service manager runs the command described in Service.StartAppOnFailure.<br><br>- *serviceFailureReboot*: the service manager restarts the computer.<br><br>- *serviceFailureRestartService*: the service manager restarts the service.<br><br><br> |
| Service.TimeoutBeforeActionOnFailure | Array of integers | Time-out (in milliseconds) before triggering the action specified in Service.ActionOnFailure. |
| Service.StartAppOnFailure | Character string | Command line called in the process of the *serviceFailureStartApp* action.<br><br>If this command line contains the %1 string, this one will be replaced by the number of successive service failures during the call. |
| Service.MessageRebootOnFailure | Character string | Message sent to the users connected to the computer via the network in case of system reboot. |
| Service.ReinitFailureCounter | Integer | Time-out (in seconds) after which the failure counter is reset to 0 if no failure occurred. |
