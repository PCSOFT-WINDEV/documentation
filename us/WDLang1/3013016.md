## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000155"></a>
The applications that you develop can react to the user's voice. For example, some actions (scrolling a table, closing windows, selecting a check box or clicking a button) are automatically supported.

All the standard commands of Windows are supported.

You can also add your own voice commands to your applications. For example, say "Find the form for Mr John Smith" and the corresponding action is performed.

### Necessary conditions
<a name="necessary_conditions_ELTPARAGRAPHE000037"></a>

![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png) To use the voice commands in your applications, your computer must be equipped with:

- Windows Vista (or later).

- a speech recognition program (Dragon Naturally Speaking for example, tests performed with version 9 "Preferred" or "standard").

### Using the voice commands in the application
<a name="using_the_voice_commands_the_application_ELTPARAGRAPHE000065"></a>

To use the voice commands in the application: 

1. Enable the voice recognition program.

2. Dictate the captions of menu options or buttons that you want to use.

### Proposing additional options or macro-commands
<a name="proposing_additional_options_macrocommands_ELTPARAGRAPHE000075"></a>

Procedures or functions can be associated with a voice command. All you have to do is associate the procedure with the command via [SpeechRecognitionAddCommand](../WDLang1/1000020014.md). This procedure is linked to the procedure for the current window.

In the procedure, the sentence that triggered the voice command can be retrieved. This allows you to isolate the requested information (customer name, city name, ...).

You have the ability to delete this association with [SpeechRecognitionDeleteCommand](../WDLang1/1000020017.md).

Example:


```wl
// Start the "Find" procedure if the voice command is recognized
nVoiceID is int 
nVoiceID = SpeechRecognitionAddCommand("Find", "Finds the form of")
```

```wl
PROCEDURE Find(Param1)
sCustomer is string = Param1[[21 TO ]]
HReadSeekFirst(sCustomer, FIRSTNAMELASTNAME, sCustomer)
```

### Disabling the speech recognition
<a name="disabling_the_speech_recognition_ELTPARAGRAPHE000099"></a>

The speech recognition is automatically enabled by default.

To disable the speech recognition in your application, use [AAFDisable](../WDLang1/1000022018.md) with the *aafSpeechRecognition* constant.
