## Remarks


- The non-working days are used to calculate the end date of a task according to its duration.
	For example, a 2-day task that starts on a Friday will end on Monday if Saturday and Sunday are non-working days.

- If the task duration is specified in hours ( Property **DurationInHours** of the Variable of type [GanttTask](../WDLang1/1000020881.md) 00300030002f002300 ), business hours are also used to calculate the end date.

- The non-working days are Saturday and Sunday by default.

- The bank holidays defined by [BankHolidayAdd](../WDLang1/1000017304.md) are considered as being non-working days.
