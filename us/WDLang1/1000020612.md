The **EventTimeline** type is used to define the advanced characteristics of an event. This event will be dispayed inside a TimeLine control. The characteristics of this event can be defined and changed using different WLanguage properties. 

The corresponding event can then be used with WLanguage functions for Timeline control management.

**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

## Example


```wl
TimelineDeleteAll(TL_Robots)
Evt is EventTimeline

TimelineAddTrack(TL_Robots, "Robot 1")
Evt.Track = "Robot 1"
Evt.Title = "Start"
Evt.Start = 10
Evt.End = 150
Evt.BackgroundColor = LightGreen
TimelineAddEvent(TL_Robots, Evt)

Evt.Track = "Robot 1"	
Evt.Title = "Special process"
Evt.Start = 150
Evt.End = 450
Evt.BackgroundColor = PastelBlue
TimelineAddEvent(TL_Robots, Evt)

Evt.Track = "Robot 1"	
Evt.Title = "Pause"
Evt.Start = 450
Evt.End = 700
Evt.BackgroundColor = LightRed
TimelineAddEvent(TL_Robots, Evt)

Evt.Track = "Robot 1"	
Evt.Title = "Stop"
Evt.Start = 700
Evt.End = 750
Evt.BackgroundColor = PastelRed
TimelineAddEvent(TL_Robots, Evt)
```

### Properties specific to TimelineEvent variables
<a name="properties_specific_timelineevent_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000030"></a>

The following properties can be used to handle an event:

| **Property name** | **Type used** | **Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Author | Character string | Name of the event author. If this property is not specified, the event has no author. |
| BackgroundColor | Integer | Background color used to display the event in the TimeLine control.<br>This color can correspond to:<br><br>- an RGB color (returned by [RGB](../WDLang1/3029012.md)), <br><br>- an HSL color (returned by [HSL](../WDLang1/3029057.md)), <br><br>- a preset color (see [the preset colors of WLanguage](../WDLang5/3010002.md)).<br><br><br>If this property is not specified, a color will be automatically calculated. The events of the same category will have the same color.<br><br>Before version 24, this property was named "BackgroundColor". |
| Category | Character string | Category of the event. If this property is not specified, the event is associated with no category. |
| Content | Character string | Detailed description of the event. The content is displayed in the TimeLine control. <br><br>If this property is not specified, the event has no description. |
| End | Integer | End of event.  This property must use the same unit as the one used to display the TimeLine control (second, millisecond or microsecond).<br>This property must necessarily be specified. |
| ID | Character string | Identifier associated with the event. Allows you to store the identifier of an element that must be associated with the element in order to use it later in programming. <br><br>For example, this identifier can correspond to the identifier of a record in a database. |
| Image | Character string | Image associated with the event. This image is displayed in the TimeLine control (in addition to the logo that represents an important element if necessary). <br><br>This property can correspond to: <br><br>- the path to an image accessible from the current computer,<br><br>- an image file found in the application library,<br><br>- an Image control containing an image,<br><br>- a drawing performed in an Image control with the drawing functions and saved in memory.<br><br><br>If this property is not specified, the event has no associated image.<br><br>**Remark**: An internal window must be used to display an image in the event. The simple style (proposed by default) cannot be used to display an image. |
| Importance | Integer | Importance of the event. <br><br>If this property is equal to or greater than 1, an icon (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=agRendezVous_IconeImportant.gif)) will be displayed in the TimeLine control to indicate an important event. <br><br>If this property is not specified, its value is set to 0. |
| Note | Character string | Note associated with the event. <br><br>If this property is not specified, no note is associated with the event. |
| Repetition | [Repetition](../WDLang1/1000019262.md) variable | Advanced parameters of repetition. This property is taken into account only if the **WithRepetition** property is set to <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>. |
| Start | Integer | Start of event. This property must use the same unit as the one used to display the TimeLine control (second, millisecond or microsecond).<br>This property must necessarily be specified. |
| Title | Character string | Title of the event. The title is displayed in the Timeline control. <br><br>If this property is not specified, the event has no title. |
| Tooltip | Character string | Tooltip displayed when the event is hovered. By default, this value includes the start and end times of the event as well as the event title. |
| Track | Character string | Track associated with the event. |
| WithRepetition | Boolean | <br><br>- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the event must be repeated, <br><br>- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if the event only happens once. <br><br><br>If the event is repeated, the **Repetition** property allows you to specify the frequency of the repetition. <br><br>This property is set to <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> by default. |
