## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000123"></a>
A process of specific exception is used to process a risky code (which means a code that could trigger an exception). The exception will be triggered if a programming error occurs in the specified code.

This specific exception process will only be available in the process in which it was declared.

**Remarks**

- A specific exception process can be declared in any process.

- A specific exception process has priority over a [general exception process](../WDLang1/3034001.md).

- After the execution of an exception process, the WLanguage code following the process is run.

- A specific exception process cannot be declared in another specific exception process. 




![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) The general exception process is not available.

```txt
WHEN EXCEPTION IN
<"Code that can trigger an exception"> 
DO

ELSE
<"Code used if the exception is not triggered">
END

## Functions for managing the specific exceptions
<a name="functions_for_managing_the_specific_exceptions_ELTTEXTE000177"></a>
Some functions specific to the management of the exceptions can be used in the processes of specific exceptions:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [ExceptionInfo](../WDLang1/3034006.md) | Retrieves the information regarding the error processed by the exception (this function replaces the exception variables used in WINDEV 5.5). |
| [ExceptionPropagate](../WDLang1/3034014.md) | Propagates an exception. |
| [ExceptionThrow](../WDLang1/3034005.md) | Artificially triggers an exception process for a given error. |
