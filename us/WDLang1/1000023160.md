| WidthMode | Integer constant | Mode for calculating the column width: <br><br>- *docWidthModeNone*: Special case. <br><br>- *docWidthModeAutomatic*: The column width is automatically calculated according to the text found in the current column and to the one found in the other columns. <br><br>- *docWidthModeUndefined*: The mode for calculating the column width is not defined because column cells have different widths. <br><br>- *docWidthModePercent*: The mode for calculating the column width is performed in percentage of total table width. <br><br>- *docWidthModeValue*: The mode for calculating the width of columns is performed according to a width supplied in millimeters. If the **WidthMillimeters** property is specified, this mode is automatically selected. <br><br><br><br><br>This property is read-only. |
