Sorts a WLanguage array. The following sorts can be performed:

- Sort a one-dimensional array of simple elements.

- Sort a two-dimensional array of simple elements according to one or more columns.

- Sort a one-dimensional array of classes or structures according to 1 or more members.

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Sort an array of records according to 1 or more items.

- Sort a one-dimensional array by specifying a comparison procedure.




**Remark**: This function is equivalent to [Sort](../WDLang1/1000017364.md).

## Syntax

### Sorting a one-dimensional array of simple elements

`ArraySort(<WLanguage array> [, <Type of sort>])`
---

**`<WLanguage array>: (Array)`**



- Name of the Array variable to use. This array must be a one-dimensional array.
	This array can also correspond to an array of simple elements of an advanced variable ("Group" array in the [gglContact](../WDLang5/1000017434.md) variables for example).

- Name of the Associative Array variable to use.
	![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) The associative arrays cannot be sorted in this version.




**`<Type of sort>: (Optional integer constant)`**

Type of sort to perform:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *asAscending* <br>(Default value) | Ascending sort.<br><br>**For an associative array**: Sorting the elements of associative array:<br><br>- **if the *asKey* constant is specified**: The sort is performed in ascending order according to the keys. In case of equality between two keys, the values are sorted according to the ascending value if the values can be compared. If the values cannot be compared, the initial order is kept.<br><br>- **if the *asKey* constant is not specified**: The sort is performed in ascending order according to the values. In case of equality between two values, the values are sorted according to the ascending key.<br><br><br> |
| *asDescending* | Descending sort.<br><br>**For an associative array**: Sorting the elements of associative array:<br><br>- **if the *asKey* constant is specified**: The sort is performed in descending order according to the keys. In case of equality between two keys, the values are sorted according to the descending value if the values can be compared. If the values cannot be compared, the initial order is kept.<br><br>- **if the *asKey* constant is not specified**: The sort is performed in descending order according to the values. In case of equality between two values, the values are sorted according to the descending key.<br><br><br> |


The sort type can be combined with one or more sort options:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *asKey* | Associative array sorted according to the key order. If this constant is not specified, the associative array is sorted according to the order of values. <br>This function is useful on the associative arrays only. |

---

**`<WLanguage array>: (Array)`**



- Name of the Array variable to use. This array must be a one-dimensional array. This array can be an array of advanced types.

- **For a one-dimensional array**: WLanguage procedure in the following format: 
	
	```txt
	PROCEDURE MyProcedure(Element1, Element2)
	```

	This procedure is automatically called by the sort mechanism to compare the elements between themselves, two by two.
	If the element 1 must be found before the element 2 in the sort order, the procedure must return -1.
	If the element 1 must be found after the element 2 in the sort order, the procedure must return 1.
	If element 1 and element 2 are identical, the procedure must return 0.  

- **For an associative array**: WLanguage procedure in the following format:
	
	```txt
	PROCEDURE MyProcedure(Value1, Key1, Value2, Key2)
	```

	This procedure is automatically called by the sort mechanism to compare the elements between themselves, two by two. The comparison can be performed in the sort procedure according to the values or according to the keys.
	If the element 1 must be found before the element 2 in the sort order, the procedure must return -1.
	If the element 1 must be found after the element 2 in the sort order, the procedure must return 1.
	If element 1 and element 2 are identical, the procedure must return 0.

## Remarks


### Miscellaneous
<a name="miscellaneous_ELTPARAGRAPHE000630"></a>

- This function cannot be used with the fixed arrays.

- Dynamic array of variants: Only a custom sort (with a sort procedure) can be used.

- This function cannot be used with the arrays of UNICODE strings.

- To add an element into a sorted array, use [ArrayAddSorted](../WDLang1/1000017013.md).

- This function can be used on the arrays of advanced variables. 

- This function is available for the associative arrays.

Example of procedure used to compare 2 integers:


```wl
PROCEDURE MyProcedure(nInt1, nInt2)
If nInt1 > nInt2 THEN RESULT 1
