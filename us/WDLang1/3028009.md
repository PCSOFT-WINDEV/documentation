<a name="description"></a>
Associates a WLanguage procedure with a DDE event: when the DDE event occurs, the associated WLanguage procedure is automatically run.

**Remark**: This function must only be used for the "New DDE dialog" of WINDEV or WEBDEV.

## Example

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![User code (UMC)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/MCU.png) 
```wl
// Trigger a call to the "DataReception" procedure whenever 
// the program receives a data sent via DDE by another application
DDEEvent("DataReception", DDEtoReceive)
```

```wl
PROCEDURE DataReception
IF (_DDE.Topic = "MySubject") AND (_DDE.Item = "MyItem") THEN
	_DDE.Cr = 1
	Info("Data received: " + _DDE.String)
ELSE
	_DDE.Cr = 0
END

## Syntax

`DDEEvent(<Procedure name> , <DDE events>)`
---

**`<Procedure name>: (Character string)`**

Name of WLanguage procedure to run. This procedure can be a global procedure or a local procedure of current window. If this parameter corresponds to an empty string (""), the "Procedure - DDE Event" association is canceled.

**`<DDE events>: (Integer constant (or combination of constants))`**

| *DDEtoAnswer* | The program receives a request for data from another application.<br><br>&lt;Procedure&gt; can find out the topic and the item affected by _DDE.Topic and _DDE.Item (_DDE.String has no significant value). | <br><br>- If the request for data is accepted, &lt;Procedure&gt; must update:<br><br>	- _DDE.Cr = 1<br><br>	- _DDE.String = &lt;value to send to the application that made the request&gt;<br><br><br><br><br>- If the request for data is not accepted, &lt;Procedure&gt; must update _DDE.Cr = 0<br><br><br> |
| *DDEtoExecute* | The program receives a command to run that comes from another application.<br><br>&lt;Procedure&gt; can find out the topic affected by _DDE.Topic and the data received by _DDE.String (_DDE.Item has no significant value). | <br><br>- If the command is run, &lt;Procedure&gt; must update _DDE.Cr = 1<br><br>- If the command is not run, &lt;Procedure&gt; must update _DDE.Cr = 0<br><br><br> |
| *DDEtoLink* | The program receives a request for a "warm" or "hot" link to a data. This request comes from another application.<br><br>&lt;Procedure&gt; can find out the topic and the item affected by _DDE.Topic and _DDE.Item (_DDE.String has no significant value). | <br><br>- If the link is created, the program must call [DDEUpdate](../WDLang1/3028011.md) whenever the data corresponding to the topic and to the item is modified. &lt;Procedure&gt; must update _DDE.Cr = 1<br><br>- If the link is not created, &lt;Procedure&gt; must update _DDE.Cr = 0<br><br><br> |
| *DDEtoModify* | The program receives the signal that the value of a linked data was modified. This signal comes from another application.<br><br>After the DDEtoModify event, you must call [DDELink](../WDLang1/3028010.md) or [DDEWarmLink](../WDLang1/3028014.md) in order for &lt;Procedure&gt; to be called.<br><br>&lt;Procedure&gt; can find out the topic and the item affected by _DDE.Topic and _DDE.Item. | <br><br>- If the modification is accepted, &lt;Procedure&gt; must update _DDE.Cr = 1<br><br>- If the modification is not accepted, &lt;Procedure&gt; must update _DDE.Cr = 0<br><br>- If the link is a hot link, _DDE.String contains the new value of the linked data; otherwise, _DDE.String is set to "" (empty string)<br><br><br> |
| *DDEtoReceive* | The program receives a data from another application.<br><br>&lt;Procedure&gt; can find out the topic and the item afected by _DDE.Topic and _DDE.Item and the data received by _DDE.String. | <br><br>- If the data is accepted, &lt;Procedure&gt; must update _DDE.Cr = 1<br><br>- If the data is not accepted, &lt;Procedure&gt; must update _DDE.Cr = 0<br><br><br> |

## Remarks




### Limits
<a name="limits_ELTPARAGRAPHE000097"></a>

- **DDEEvent** cannot be called in the class constructor or destructor.

- [Multitask](../WDLang1/3015004.md) must not be run in a procedure called by **DDEEvent**.

- The debugger cannot be called by Ctrl + Pause in a procedure called by **DDEEvent**. You must add the [Stop](../Motscles/1511014.md) keyword.



<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>




### Default values
<a name="default_values_ELTPARAGRAPHE000118"></a>

By default, _DDE.Cr is set to 1 (OK) and _DDE.String is set to "" (empty string).
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>




### Triggering the same procedure for several events 
<a name="triggering_the_same_procedure_for_several_events_ELTPARAGRAPHE000126"></a>

The same procedure can be triggered by the action of several DDE events. In this case, the syntax is for example:


```wl
DDEEvent("DataReception", DDEtoReceive + DDEtoModify)
```


For these two events, you must identify in &lt;Procedure name&gt; the DDE event that triggered the call to the procedure. To do so, you must check the _DDE.Event variable.

The _DDE.Event variable returns, according to the case:

- *DDEtoAnswer*.

- *DDEtoReceive*.

- *DDEtoExecute*.

- *DDEtoLink*.

- *DDEtoModify*.
