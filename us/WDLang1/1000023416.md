---

<a name="NOTE0_1"></a>

## Remarks


- To close the wait window, [WaitWindowEnd](../WDLang1/1000023417.md) must be called as many times as **WaitWindowStart** was called.

- A single wait window can be displayed at a time. If **WaitWindowStart** is called while the wait window is already opened, the message displayed will be refreshed with the message specified during the last call.

- **WaitWindowStart** and [WaitWindowEnd](../WDLang1/1000023417.md) can be called from a secondary thread.

- The wait window displays an infinite progress bar. In order for this progress bar to be displayed and animated, you must give control back to the main application thread when running the process that requires a wait. This process should be performed in a secondary thread or in a parallel task. If the process must access the GUI, call [ExecuteMainThread](../WDLang1/1000019862.md) to perform these accesses.
