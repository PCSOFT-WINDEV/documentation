Saves the repositionable notes of the current window in a file. All repositionable notes are saved: 

- Repositionable Note control. 

- Repositionable note created via the AAF (Automatic Application Feature). 

- Repositionable note created through programming ([NoteCreate](../WDLang1/1000022395.md), [WinEdCreateNote](../WDLang1/1000022270.md), [ControlCreate](../WDLang1/1000020876.md)).

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`NoteSaveAll([<File>])`
---

**`<File>: (Optional character string)`**

Name of file containing the repositionable notes to save. 

If this parameter is not specified, the repositionable notes are saved in the file: &lt;Window Name&gt;.wdnote found in the data directory. The backup file corresponds to: 
```txt
fDataDir()\<MyWindow..Name>.wdnote
```




<a name="NOTE0"></a>
<a name="NOTE0_1"></a>

## Remarks


- This function is equivalent to the AAF (Automatic Application Features) for importing notes without displaying the file picker. For more details, see [Repositionable note (AAF)](../Editeurs/1000021820.md). 

- The saved elements are: the position of note, its content, its background color and the characteristics of the font used.

- Then, the saved repositionable notes can be imported: 

	- Into the editor (by Drag and Drop or by opening the notes file). 

	- Through programming via [NoteLoadAll](../WDLang1/1000022397.md). 




- The function has no effect if no note was created.
