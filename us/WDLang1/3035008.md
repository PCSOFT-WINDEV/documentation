Returns the list of applications currently run. These applications can correspond to WINDEV or WINDEV Mobile applications, or to other applications.

For each application found, you have the ability to find out:

- its identifier.

- the identifier of parent process (the one that started the application). 

- the name and extension of its executable.

- the name and full path of its executable.

- the current amount of memory used.

- the maximum amount of memory used.

- the command line used by the executable.

**`<Result>: (Character string)`**

List of applications currently run. The different applications are separated by CR characters (Carriage Return).
The list has the following format:

```

If no information is requested, the list has the following format: &lt;Name and extension of the application executable>.

**`<First information>: (Optional Integer constant)`**

|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *exeCommandLine* | Command line of application executable. <br><br>**Caution**: <br><br>- The current user must have sufficient rights to read the content of the memory linked to the process. <br><br>- The 32-bit applications cannot access the information of 64-bit processes.<br><br><br> |
| *exeMemory* | Amount of memory currently consumed by the application.<br>This constant is available for Windows NT, 2000 and XP. In the other cases, an empty string ("") is returned. |
| *exeMaxMemory* | Maximum amount of memory consumed by the application.<br>This constant is available for Windows NT, 2000 and XP. In the other cases, an empty string ("") is returned. |
| *exeShortName*<br>(Default value) | Name and extension of application executable. |
| *exeLongName* | Name and full path of application executable.<br> |
| *exePID* | Application identifier. |
| *exeParentPID* | Identifier of parent process (the one that started the application). |





**`<Seventh information>: (Optional Integer constant)`**

Seventh information that will be returned for each application currently run:
