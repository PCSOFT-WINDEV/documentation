I is int
I = RTFSearch(EDT_Edit1, "WINDEV")
WHILE I > 0
	// Switch to red
	RTFSelection(EDT_Edit1, rtfColor, LightRed, I, 6)
	// Switch to underlined
	RTFSelection(EDT_Edit1, rtfUnderlined, True, I, 6)
	// Find the next "WINDEV"
	I = RTFSearch(EDT_Edit1, "WINDEV", rtfCaseSensitive, I + 1)
END
```

```wl
nRes is int
sString is string = EDT_Edit1
// ****** USES A STRING VARIABLE

nRes = RTFSearch(sString, "RTF", rtfFullWord, 1)
WHILE nRes <> 0
	nRes = RTFSearch(sString, "RTF", rtfFullWord, nRes + 3)

## Syntax

`<Result> = RTFSearch(<RTF control or string> , <String to find> [, <Options> [, <Start>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**



- Position of the first character of the search string within the initial string. 

- 0 if the search string is not found. 


The RTF formatting is ignored.

**`<RTF control or string>: (Character string)`**

Name of the RTF control or RTF string where the search will be performed.

**`<String to find>: (Character string)`**

Character string that must be found in the control or in the string.

**`<Options>: (Optional constant (or combination of constants))`**

Indicates the parameters for the search: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *rtfCaseSensitive* | The search is case sensitive. |
| *rtfFullWord* | Only the full words are sought. |



**`<Start>: (Optional integer)`**

Position of the character from which the specified string is sought. 
If this parameter is not specified, the search starts at the cursor position (or at the end of the selected text) and continues until the end of the text in the control or string.
