Opens a non-modal sibling window. **OpenSister** is also used to:

- define the position of the sibling window,

- pass parameters to the sibling window.




The following operations are performed when **OpenSister** is called:

- the event "Global declarations" of the sibling window is run,

- running the initialization events of the controls (the order is undefined),

- running the processes following the call to **OpenSister** of calling window,

- displaying the sibling window.




**Remark**: By default, the sibling window keeps focus once it is opened.

## Syntax

### Opening a sibling window

`OpenSister(<Window name> [, <Parameter 1> [... [, <Parameter N>]]])`
---

**`<Window name>: (Character string)`**



- Name of sibling window to open.

- Name and full path of sibling window (".WDW" file) to open.




**`<Parameter 1>: (Type of value sent to the window (optional))`**

First parameter that will be passed to the "Global declarations" event of the window to open. This parameter is passed by value and is considered a variable global to the window.
This parameter cannot correspond to an array variable (arrays can only be passed by reference).



**`<Parameter N>: (Type of value sent to the window (optional))`**

Nth parameter that must be passed to the "Global declarations" event of the window to open. This parameter is passed by value and is considered a variable global to the window.
This parameter cannot correspond to an array variable (arrays can only be passed by reference).

### Opening a sibling window while defining its position and its display level

`OpenSister(<Window name [ + <Level>]> [, <Parameter 1> [... [, <Parameter N>]]])`
---

**`<Window name [ + ]>: (Character string)`**

Used to specify: 

- **the window to open** (&lt;Window name&gt;). This parameter can correspond to: 

	- Name of sibling window to open.

	- Name and full path of sibling window (".WDW" file) to open.


 By default, the window is displayed according to the position defined in the editor. You can define the display position of the window. The window name is completed by the window display coordinates when opened. This parameter has the following format: 
	
	```txt
	"[<Alias>] = <Window name> [, <Y>, <X>]"
	```

	 where: 
	

- &lt;Alias&gt;: alias of the window if the same window is opened several times.

- &lt;Window name&gt;: name of sibling window to open.
			![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) To avoid giving focus to the opened window, use the following notation: &lt;Window name&gt; + **NoFocus**. The event "Gain of focus" of the sibling window will not be run. Caution: in this case, the window name must be enclosed in quotes.

- &lt;Y&gt;: window display vertical coordinate (in pixels, relative to the upper-left corner of the screen or parent window).

- &lt;X&gt;: window display horizontal coordinate (in pixels, relative to the upper-left corner of the screen or parent window).

- **the window display level** (&lt;Level&gt;):
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *Above* | Window opened above all its sibling windows. |
| *AboveAll* | Window opened above all the other windows (including the windows of other applications). |

 **Remark**: If two windows are opened with the same constant (*Above* or *AboveAll*), the second window will be opened above the first one. 
	It is recommended to use [WinStatus](../WDLang1/3038030.md) to change the display level of a window.




**`<Parameter 1>: (Type of value sent to the window (optional))`**

First parameter that will be passed to the "Global declarations" event of the window to open. This parameter is passed by value and is considered a variable global to the window.
This parameter cannot correspond to an array variable (arrays can only be passed by reference).



**`<Parameter N>: (Type of value sent to the window (optional))`**

Last parameter that will be passed to the "Global declarations" event of the window to open. This parameter is passed by value and is considered a variable global to the window.
This parameter cannot correspond to an array variable (arrays can only be passed by reference).

## Remarks


### Parameters passed to the sibling window to open
<a name="parameters_passed_the_sibling_window_open_ELTPARAGRAPHE000146"></a>The parameters are retrieved in the event "Global declarations" of the window. Simply write the following line of code at the start:


```txt
PROCEDURE <Window name>(<Parameter1> [, <Parameter2> [, ...]])
```
These parameters are passed by value and not by reference.

For more details, see [Window with parameters](../WDChamp/1010026.md).


<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Window opening mode
<a name="window_opening_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000170"></a>

The window is opened in non-modal mode:

- the parent window remains the current window.

- once the sibling window is opened, the processes following the call to **OpenSister** in the calling window are run.

- the user will have the ability to click one of the parent windows of current window.

### Opening the same window several times
<a name="opening_the_same_window_several_times_ELTPARAGRAPHE000190"></a>

- If the same window is opened several time, we recommend that you use an alias. This alias is used to differentiate between each window.

- The position of the calling window (relative to the screen or to the sibling window) is chosen when the window is described in the editor. If the same window is opened several times (with an alias), the display positions must be modified at each opening (otherwise the windows will be stacked).

- The number of windows that can be opened simultaneously depends on the available memory.

### Closing a window
<a name="closing_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000199"></a>

A window opened with **OpenSister** can be closed with [Close](../WDLang1/3038018.md) (without parameters) from any event:

- of the window,

- of a window control.

### Title of the window to be opened
<a name="title_the_window_opened_ELTPARAGRAPHE000216"></a>

By default, the window title is the one defined in the editor.

To modify the window title, use [NextTitle](../WDLang1/3038043.md) or [CurrentTitle](../WDLang1/3038023.md).

### Opening a component window
<a name="opening_component_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000233"></a>To open a component window, all you have to do is use the name of the component window (the component being included in the project). For example:


```wl
OpenSister(ComponentWindow)
```
If a conflict occurs with a project element, the element name must be prefixed by the component name. For example:


```wl
OpenSister(MyComponent.Window)
```
To use the name of the window in a variable, the name of the component must be specified. For example:


```wl
sWindow is string = "MyComponent.MyWindow"
OpenSister(sWindow)
```
