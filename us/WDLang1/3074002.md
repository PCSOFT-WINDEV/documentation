<a name="description"></a>
Creates a Table control from the items of a data file (view or query). Each column of the control is bound to an item in the data file. The width of the columns changes automatically according to the data in the file or query.

This function is used to get a Table control adapted to the browse of a specific data file.

```wl
// Displays the content of "CUSTOMERS" file in a Table control based on a data file

```wl
// Displays the query content in a Table control populated programmatically

## Syntax

`BuildBrowsingTable(<Table control> , <Data file> [, <Options>])`
---

**`<Table control>: (Control name)`**

Name of the Table control (based on a data file or populated programmatically). 

Caution: This control must exist in the window. It may have been created by [ControlCreate](../WDLang1/1000020876.md).

The records in the data file can be viewed directly if this parameter corresponds to a Table control based on a data file.

**`<Data file>: (Character string)`**

Name of data file, view or query used as a base for creating the Table control.

**`<Options>: (Optional constant (or combination of constants))`**

Configures the creation mode of columns in the Table control.

|   | Operating mode with the constant | Default operating mode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *taWithBinary* | Binary items (link composite key for example) are added to the Table control. | By default: Binary items (link composite key for example) are not added to the Table control. |
| *taWithAutoID* | A column is generated for the automatic identifier. | By default: No column for the automatic identifier. |
| *taWithDetailsBinding* | A sub-table is automatically generated to display the bound items from the data files of the analysis. | By default: No "row details" window is displayed. |
| *taKeepBrowseKey* | The search key of the Table control based on a data file does not change (this search key is returned by the [BrowsedItem](../Proprietes/2510111.md) property). | By default: The first key item found is positioned as search key. |
| *taKeepColumn* | The existing columns in the Table control are not deleted. | By default: The existing columns are deleted. |
| *taItemCaption* | The captions of items are used for the titles of columns. | By default: The name of the item is used as column title. |
| *taByLogicalOrder* | The columns are created according to the logical order of items defined in the data model editor.<br>For the queries, the logical order and the physical order of items are identical. | By default: The physical order of the items in the data file is used.<br>For the queries, the logical order and the physical order of items are identical. |
| *taFillTable* | Table controls are populated programmatically with the content from the data file (Caution: this can be a long operation that may cause the memory to overflow). | By default: Table controls are not populated programmatically. |
| *taWithAutoID* | Input allowed in the column associated with the automatic identifier (if it exists and if the Table control is in edit). |   |
| *taNoAdjust* | The width of the columns is not adjusted (the records are not read). |   |
| *taNoMemoText* | The 'text memo' items are not added into the Table control. | By default: The "text memo" items are added into the Table control. |
| *taNoMemoImage* | The "image memo" items are not added into the Table control. | By default: The "image memo" items are added into the Table control. |

## Remarks




### Characteristics of the Table control (by default)
<a name="characteristics_the_table_control_default_ELTPARAGRAPHE000141"></a>

- The columns of Table control defined in the editor are deleted.

- The input modes defined in the editor for the Table control are kept.

- A column whose type is identical to the item type is created for each item of the data file.

- No column is created for the binary memo items (a column is created for the text memo items or for the image memo items).

- The properties of Table controls and columns are updated to allow the file to be browsed through:
	
	```txt
	<Table control>.BrowsedFile = <Data file name>
	```

	and for each column:
	
	```txt
	<Column name>.DataBinding = <Name of the bound item>
	<Column name>.BrowsedItem = <First key in data file>
	```

### Table control populated programmatically
<a name="table_control_populated_programmatically_ELTPARAGRAPHE000160"></a>

If &lt;Table control&gt; corresponds to a Table control populated programmatically, no data is displayed (the Table control is empty) but the Table control and column properties are assigned like in the case of a Table control based on a data file.

To display data in the Table control, use the [TableAdd](../WDLang1/3074017.md) or **BuildBrowsingTable** functions with the *taFillTable* constant.

**Remark**: The *taFillTable* constant cannot be used to programmatically populate Table controls with image memos. To add an image into a Table control populated programmatically, the corresponding file must be found in the application library (WDL file) or it must be accessible from the current computer.

### Columns
<a name="columns_ELTPARAGRAPHE000177"></a>

The created columns are named "_COL1", "_COL2", "_COL3", etc. These columns are accessible by programming via the indirection operator { }.

**You cannot write**:


```wl
TABLE_TABLE1._COL1.Width = 120 // Generates an error "_COL1 unknown"
```


You must write:


```wl
{"TABLE_TABLE1._COL1"}..Width = 120
```

### Miscellaneous
<a name="miscellaneous_ELTPARAGRAPHE000193"></a>

- **BuildBrowsingTable** browses through the data file. The current record may be modified once this function has been used.

- The table is populated by **BuildBrowsingTable** in a parallel process in the background: if the data source is a query, this query must not be freed before closing the window or before reinitializing the Table control.
