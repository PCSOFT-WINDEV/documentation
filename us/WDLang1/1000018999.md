## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000082"></a>
The dongles of Hasp family (Hasp3, Hasp4, NetHasp, memoHasp and Hasp HL) are used to protect the applications developed with WINDEV or WEBDEV.

The Hasp functions allow you to restrict the use of an application to the people who own a valid dongle.

Another protection method consists in using [the functions for managing activation keys](../WDLang1/1000018998.md).

**Remarks**: 

- To use the Hasp functions, you must know the operating mode of the Hasp keys and you must have their documentation.

- [Hasp](../WDLang1/3013038.md) is not available in 64-bit, use HaspHLxxx functions instead.

## Hasp functions
<a name="hasp_functions_ELTTEXTE000106"></a>
The Hasp functions are as follows:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [Hasp](../WDLang1/3013038.md) | Interrogates an electronic HASP key (HASP-3, HASP-4, MemoHasp or NetHasp). |
| [HaspHLDecrypt](../WDLang1/1000018894.md) | Decrypts a character string by using the algorithms of the Hasp key. |
| [HaspHLEncrypt](../WDLang1/1000018893.md) | Encrypts a character string by using the algorithms of the specified Hasp key. |
| [HaspHLInfo](../WDLang1/1000018895.md) | Returns information about the electronic Hasp key. |
| [HaspHLLogin](../WDLang1/1000018891.md) | Connects the application with a Hasp key. |
| [HaspHLLogout](../WDLang1/1000018892.md) | Closes the connection of the application to a Hasp key. |
| [HaspHLRead](../WDLang1/1000018896.md) | Reads data (character string or buffer) in the internal memory of the Hasp key. |
| [HaspHLWrite](../WDLang1/1000018897.md) | Writes data (character string or buffer) into the internal memory of the Hasp key. |
