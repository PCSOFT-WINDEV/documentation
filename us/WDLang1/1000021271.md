## Example


```wl
// Create an event
LetsGo is eventAutomatic

// Run a first thread
ThreadExecute("Thread1", threadNormal, "Thread_First")
// Locks the current thread until the event is obtained
ThreadWaitSignal()

// Run a second thread
ThreadExecute("Thread2", threadNormal, "Thread_Second")
// Locks the current thread until the event is obtained
ThreadWaitSignal()

// Opens the event to run the threads
EventOpen(LetsGo)
```

```wl
PROCEDURE Thread_First()
Trace(dbgInfo(dbgProcess) + " - ThreadSendSignal(threadMain)")
ThreadSendSignal(threadMain)
EventWait("LetsGo")
Trace(dbgInfo(dbgProcess) + " - Event received")
```

```wl
PROCEDURE Thread_Second()
Trace(dbgInfo(dbgProcess) + " - ThreadSendSignal(threadMain)")
ThreadSendSignal(threadMain)
EventWait("LetsGo")
Trace(dbgInfo(dbgProcess) + " - Event received")

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`EventOpen(<Event>)`
---

**`<Event>: (Character string, or AutomaticEvent or ManualEvent variable)`**

Name of the event to open. This name can correspond to: 

- a character string, 

- the name of a variable of type [ManualEvent](../WDLang1/1000021275.md), 

- the name of a variable of type [AutomaticEvent](../WDLang1/1000021270.md). 






<a name="NOTE0"></a>
<a name="NOTE0_1"></a>

## Remarks


- This function is equivalent to the following syntax of [EventChange](../WDLang1/3077017.md): 
	
	```txt
	EventChange(<Event>, eventOpen)
	```


- **For an automatic event**: A single thread is processed by the event. 
	The event is automatically closed once the thread is processed. 

	- **Pending threads**: If there is no pending thread, the event remains open until the next thread, then it is closed. 

	- **New threads**: The new threads are added to the pending queue.




- **For a manual event**: The event is opened. 

	- **Pending threads**: All the pending threads are processed. 

	- **New threads**: If other threads arrive while the event is still open, they are processed.
