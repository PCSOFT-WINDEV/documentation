Enables the runtime log programmatically.

**Remark**: Starting with version 28, the runtime log contains a ".wxl" file, a ".ndx" file and a ".mmo" file. If the project corresponding to the runtime log is opened in the editor, the log file can be directly opened in the editor: 

- on the "Home" tab, in the "General" group, expand "Open", select "Open", and then select the desired ".wxl" file.

- drag the ".wxl" file from the file explorer and drop it onto the editor. 


For more details, see [Runtime log](../Editeurs/2019030.md).

Note: In previous versions, the runtime log was a ".wlog" file.

## Example


```wl
// Enables the default runtime log
dbgEnableLog()
```

<a name="XSYNTAX"></a>
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

## Syntax

`<Result> = dbgEnableLog([<Log file> [, <Options>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the runtime log was started, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise.




**`<Log file>: (Optional character string)`**

Location and name of the log file to create. The name and location of the log file can be: 

- fully customized. 

- built using the following keywords: 
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [%ExeDir%] | Directory of the executable, always filled with the "\\" character. This directory is equivalent to the result of [fExeDir](../WDLang1/3036049.md). |
| [%ExeName%] | Executable name. |
| [%Date%] | Start date of runtime log (YYYYMMDD format). |
| [%Time%] | Start time of runtime log (HHMMSS format). |
| [%UserName%] | Name of the current user. |
| [%ComputerName%] | Computer name. |
| [%DataDir%] | Directory of the HFSQL data files specified by the user when installing the application. This directory is equivalent to the result of [fDataDir](../WDLang1/3036001.md). |
| [%DirUserData%] | Directory for the data of the current user of the current application.  This directory is equivalent to the result of [fDataDirUser](../WDLang1/3036071.md). |





By default, the name of the Log file corresponds to: 
"[%UserDataDir%][%ExeName%]_[%Date%]_[%Time%]". 
For example: 
"C:\\Users\\Doc\\AppData\\Roaming\\WINDEV Applications\\MyApp\\Myapp_20071023_130812.wlog".

Caution: If you build strings dynamically ("Allow '[% %]' in the strings" option in the "Compilation" tab of the project description, a compilation error appears (unknown identifier). In this case, each string must be preceded by '-%'. Example: 

```wl
dbgEnableLog("[%DirUserData%][%ExeName%]_[%Date%]_[%Time%]")
```
 becomes
```wl
dbgEnableLog(-%"[%DirUserData%][%ExeName%]_[%Date%]_[%Time%]")
```


**`<Options>: (Optional Integer constant (or combination of constants))`**

Used to configure the options of the runtime log:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *LogAll* | The runtime log retrieves:<br><br>- the WLanguage functions<br><br>- the parameters of the functions<br><br>- the processes<br><br><br> |
| *LogEnabled* | The runtime log is immediately enabled. |
| *LogParameters* | The parameters of the functions are written into the runtime log. |
| *LogPause* | The runtime log is not immediately enabled |
| *LogProcessOnly* | The runtime log only retrieves information about the processes. |
| *LogWLanguageFunctions* | The WLanguage functions are written into the runtime log. |


The combination *LogEnabled* + *LogWLanguageFunctions* is used by default if this parameter is not specified.

## Remarks


### Operating mode of the runtime log
<a name="operating_mode_the_runtime_log_ELTPARAGRAPHE000270"></a>

- **dbgEnableLog** must be called only once. Any other call to this function will have no effect.

- To temporarily enable or disable the runtime log, use [dbgLogStatus](../WDLang1/1000017138.md).

- To modify the options of the runtime log, use [dbgLogOption](../WDLang1/1000017136.md).


![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Remark: The runtime log can also be started via the ".wx" file found beside the executable. For more details, see [Runtime log](../Editeurs/2019030.md).


### Miscellaneous
<a name="miscellaneous_ELTPARAGRAPHE000292"></a>

- **dbgEnableLog** can be used in a REST webservice. 

- You can define any location for the log file. In this case, keep in mind there may be permission-related issues. 
	Reminder: Generally, the data directory is accessible in write mode.
