## Remarks


- **RegistryCopyKey** performs a recursive copy.

- Starting with Windows Vista, copy-related operations are performed in a transaction. If an operation fails, all the previous operations are canceled.

- In the earlier versions of Windows, the operations linked to the copy are not performed in transaction. If an operation fails (e.g. copying a subkey), previous operations (e.g. copying other subkeys) are not canceled.
