## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`HTMLEditorSearch(<HTML Editor control> , <Text to find> , <WLanguage procedure> [, <Options> [, <Maximum number>]])`
---

**`<HTML Editor control>: (Control name)`**

Name of the HTML Editor control used. 

**`<Text to find>: (Character string)`**

Text to search for in the HTML Editor control.

**`<WLanguage procedure>: (Procedure name)`**

WLanguage procedure ("callback") executed for each element found. This procedure has the following format: 

```txt
PROCEDURE <Procedure name>(nPosition is int)
```
where &lt;nPosition&gt; is an integer that corresponds to the position of the searched text with respect to the text without tags. This value can be used: 

- with the [Cursor](../Proprietes/2510025.md) property,

- with the [HTMLEditorSelect](../WDLang1/1000025926.md) function. 


At the end of the search, &lt;nPos&gt; is set to 0. 

**`<Options>: (Optional constant (or combination of constants))`**

Search options:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *IgnoreCase* | Case and accent insensitive search (ignores uppercase and lowercase differences). |
| *WholeWord* | Search for the whole word (enclosed in punctuation characters or in space characters). |


By default, the search is case-sensitive: the searched text and the text to find must have the same case. To perform a case-insensitive search, use the *IgnoreCase* constant.

**`<Maximum number>: (Optional integer)`**

Maximum number of elements to be found. Limits the search (for example, take into account only the first 5 elements found).
