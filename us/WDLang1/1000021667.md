## Example

t1.Procédure = Procédure3
t2 est une TâcheParallèle = t1.Exécute()
```

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Running a parallel task described beforehand (ParallelTask variable)

`<Result> = <Task>.Execute()`
---

**`<Result>: (ParallelTask variable)`**

[ParallelTask](../WDLang1/1000021220.md) variable corresponding to the task run.

**`<Task>: (ParallelTask variable)`**

Name of the [ParallelTask](../WDLang1/1000021220.md) variable corresponding to the task to run. 

Caution: A WLanguage error occurs if the task is currently run or if the task was already run.

## Remarks


- The task is saved in the queue of tasks to run. 

- **<Variable TâcheParallèle>Execute** is not a blocking function and does not wait for task to be completed.

- Comparison between the different types of copy for the HFSQL context: 
	

| Type of copy | Benefits | Drawbacks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Full copy** | copy: <br><br>	- the extensive connection parameters (connections, physical paths, ...).<br><br>	- the positions, the filters, ... defined on the data files.<br><br>	- the queries. <br><br><br> | Memory consumption (on the client and on the server). |
| **Light copy** | Copies the extensive connection parameters (connections, physical paths, ...).<br><br>No memory consumption on the server. | The records and the current filters are not copied. Therefore, the records must be repositioned by HReadSeek for example. <br><br>No copy of queries. <br><br>Memory consumption on the Client computer |
| **Delayed copy** | No memory consumption (on the client and on the server). | Risk: If the extended connection parameters are modified, the last modification will be taken into account. <br><br>The records and the current filters are not copied. Therefore, the records must be repositioned by HReadSeek for example. <br><br>No copy of queries. |





In most cases, the delayed copy is recommended provided that you don't change the connection parameters and that you perform the necessary calls to **HReadSeek**.
