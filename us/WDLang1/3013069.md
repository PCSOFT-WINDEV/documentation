Resets the variable to its initial value.

**If the variable is a structure, a class, a composite variable**, the function resets all the members to their initial value.

**If the variable is an array**, the function resets all the elements to their initial value without modifying the dimensions of the array.

**If the variable is an associative array, a queue, a stack or a list**, **VariableReset** is equivalent to [DeleteAll](../WDLang1/1000017357.md): all the elements are deleted.

## Remarks




### Case of arrays
<a name="case_arrays_ELTPARAGRAPHE000088"></a>

If the variable is an Array, the array is not resized. All the array elements are reset to their initial values:

- The booleans are reset to <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>.

- The numeric values are reset to 0.

- The strings are reset to empty strings ("").

- The members of instances and structures are reset to their initial values.

- The instances, structures and dynamic arrays are freed.




To reset the size of a one-dimensional array to 0, use [ArrayDeleteAll](../WDLang1/3075010.md).

### Case of objects
<a name="case_objects_ELTPARAGRAPHE000111"></a>

If the variable is an object:

- the destructor is called

- if it is a dynamic instance, the object is freed.

- if it is a non-dynamic instance, the constructor is called




![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) **Special case in Java/Android**
The concept of destructor does not exist in Java/Android. Therefore, the code found in the destructor of a class will never be run. 
An object is freed by the garbage collector when it is no longer referenced in the application. There is no way to foresee the moment when this operation occurs.
To force an object to be freed, you have the ability to assign it to NULL or to use the [Free](../Motscles/1511012.md) statement.
