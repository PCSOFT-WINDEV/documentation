## Example


```wl
// Display the propositions returned by the speech recognition service in a List Box control
MyList is string 
MyList = SpeechRecognitionTrigger("I am listening...")
IF ErrorOccurred = False THEN
	FOR EACH STRING Proposition of MyList SEPARATED BY CR
		ListAdd(LIST_ListProposition, Proposition)
	END
END
```

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

### Triggering the speech recognition service (synchronous mode)

`<Result> = SpeechRecognitionTrigger([<Text>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Character string)`**



- List of words or sentences proposed by the speech recognition service based on the words pronounced by the user. Each proposition is separated by a CR character (Carriage Return). 

- Empty string ("") in the following cases: 

	- if the speech recognition was canceled by the user. 

	- if an error occurred. 

	- if no match was found by the speech recognition service. 


 In this case, the [ErrorOccurred](../WDLang1/3087001.md) variable is set to <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md).




**`<Text>: (Optional character string)`**

Text that will appear in the window displayed by the speech recognition service. This window blocks the application.

## Remarks


### Special cases
<a name="special_cases_ELTPARAGRAPHE000082"></a>

- **SpeechRecognitionTrigger** uses the device's speech recognition service. The function will fail if this service is not available. 

- When speech recognition is triggered, a window is opened to notify the user of the start and end of the speech recognition session as well as the progress of the process. 

	- Syntax 1: **SpeechRecognitionTrigger** blocks the application as long as this window is displayed.




- If one of the propositions returned by the speech recognition service corresponds to a command added to the current window by [SpeechRecognitionAddCommand](../WDLang1/1000020014.md), the WLanguage procedure corresponding to this command will be executed.

- **Caution**: **SpeechRecognitionTrigger** requires an Internet connection and therefore cannot be used in offline mode.
