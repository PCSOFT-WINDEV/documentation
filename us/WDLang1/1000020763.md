## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = ControlFindTextFirst(<Element> , <Searched text> [, <Search options> [, <Highlighting of first element> [, <Highlighting of elements found>]]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**



- Number of occurrences found in the control or window. 

- 0 if no element contains the searched text. 




**`<Element>: (Window name or control name)`**

Name of element where the search will be performed. This element can correspond to: 

- a window name. The search is performed in the caption of controls, the text of buttons, the text of edit controls, the text of table rows, ... The search is performed in all the visible controls that have no invisible parent. 

- a control name. If this element corresponds to a Ribbon control, the search is performed in all ribbon controls. 




**`<Searched text>: (Character string)`**



- Text that must be found in the specified element. 

- "" (empty string) to cancel the search. 




**`<Search options>: (Optional Integer constant)`**

Indicates the search options: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *IgnoreCase* | Case and accent insensitive search (ignores uppercase/lowercase differences) |
| *WholeWord* | Searches for a whole word (between punctuation characters or spaces) |
| 0 | Search while taking the case into account (uppercase/lowercase characters) on a text "contained in". |


No option is selected by default: the search is sensitive to the case and it is performed on incomplete words. 

**`<Highlighting of first element>: (Integer or constant (optional))`**

Color used to highlight the first element found. This color can correspond to:

- an RGB color (returned by [RGB](../WDLang1/3029012.md)),

## Remarks


- A single search can be performed at a given time in a control or in a window. 

- The call to **ControlFindTextFirst** cancels a possible previous call to [ControlFindHighlight](../WDLang1/1000020535.md). 

- The search is not performed in the following controls: 

	- HTML control and edit control in HTML format. 

	- ActiveX control.
