## Example


```wl
// Open a popup window without passing parameters 
OpenPopupAsynchronous(WIN_SelectColor, popBelow + popAlignedRight + popAccordingToControl, 
		"BTN_ActionColor", CloseColorSelect)
INTERNAL PROCEDURE CloseColorSelect(SelectedColor)
	IMG_PRODUCT.Color = SelectedColor
END
```

```wl
// Open a popup window with parameters 
OpenPopupAsynchronous(WIN_SelectColor, popBelow + popAlignedRight + popAccordingToControl, 
		"BTN_ActionColor", CloseColorSelect, DarkRed)
INTERNAL PROCEDURE CloseColorSelect(SelectedColor)
	IF SelectedColor <> -1 THEN
		IMG_PRODUCT.Color = SelectedColor
	END

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`OpenPopupAsynchronous(<Window> [, <Parameters> [, <Opening mode> [, <Reference control>]]] [, <WLanguage procedure>])`
---

**`<Window>: (Window name)`**

Name of the window to be opened.

**`<Parameters>: (Character string)`**

List of parameters to be passed to the window. This list of parameters has the following format: 

```txt
(<Parameter 1>, ..., <Parameter N>)
```

 where:

- &lt;Parameter 1&gt;: First parameter that will be passed to the "Global declarations" event of the window to open. This parameter is passed by value and is considered a variable global to the window.
	This parameter cannot correspond to an array variable (arrays can only be passed by reference).

- &lt;Parameter N&gt;: Nth parameter that must be passed to the "Global declarations" event of the window to open. This parameter is passed by value and is considered a variable global to the window.
	This parameter cannot be a variable of type array (arrays can only be passed by reference).


If the window expects no parameters, this parameter must be set to "()". 

**`<Opening mode>: (Combination of constants)`**

Specify the position and the opening mode of the popup window. These constants are:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *popAbove* | The popup window will be opened above the calling control. |
| *popAccordingToControl* | Opens the popup window according to the position of a control other than the calling control. In this case:<br><br>- the control name must be specified (&lt;Control name>).<br><br>- the control name will be automatically retrieved by [MyPopupControl](../Motscles/1511005.md).<br><br><br> |
| *popAlignedLeft* | The left border of the popup window will be aligned with the left control border. The popup window stretches to the right. |
| *popAlignedRight* | The right border of the popup window will be aligned with the right border of the control. The popup window stretches to the left. |
| *popBelow* | The popup window will be opened below the calling control. |
|  *popCenteredHorizontally* | The popup window is centered horizontally with the calling control. |
| *popCenteredWindow* | The popup window is centered relative to the parent window. |
| *popDefault* <br>(Default value) | By default, the *popAlignedLeft* + *popBelow* constants are used. |
| *popDisableAutoRepositioning* | Disables automatic repositioning if the popup window is likely to be truncated. <br><br> |



**`<Reference control>: (Optional control name)`**

Name of the control under which the popup window must be opened. This parameter must be specified only if the *popAccordingToControl* constant was used.

**`<WLanguage procedure>: (Name of optional or lambda procedure)`**

Name of the WLangage procedure ("callback") called after the window is closed. For more details on this procedure, see [Parameters of the procedure used by OpenPopupAsynchronous](../WDLang1/1410087854.md). 

This WLanguage procedure can correspond to: 

- a name of a global procedure,

- a name of an internal procedure,

- a lambda procedure.

## Remarks


### Opening the popup window
<a name="opening_the_popup_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000134"></a>

- **OpenPopupAsynchronous** opens the window in modal and asynchronous mode: 

	- code execution continues without waiting for the popup window to be closed,

	- the WLanguage procedure will be called when the popup window is closed. 

	- if the user clicks on another window, the popup window will be closed.

### Characteristics of the popup window
<a name="characteristics_the_popup_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000149"></a>

- The popup window is automatically closed if it loses focus, or when [Close](../WDLang1/3038018.md) is called. 

- The style of the popup windows is applied to the window opened by **OpenPopupAsynchronous**. If a title bar was defined in the editor, this title bar is reduced and the window cannot be maximized or minimized.

- The popup window is opened below the control that calls **OpenPopupAsynchronous**. If there is not enough space to open the window, the window will be opened either above the control, or below the control to the left.



<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Limitations
<a name="limitations_ELTPARAGRAPHE000167"></a>

- **OpenPopupAsynchronous** must be executed from the code of a control.

- The control that calls **OpenPopupAsynchronous** must be visible.

- A non-modal window cannot be opened from a popup window. [Open](../WDLang1/3038035.md) must be used to open a window. Opening a modal window from a popup window does not automatically close the popup window. In this case, you must process the return value of [Open](../WDLang1/3038035.md) and you must use [Close](../WDLang1/3038018.md) to close the popup window.

- A popup window cannot be opened from another popup window.
