## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000167"></a>
To manage the video sequence currently transmitted by the Web camera installed on the current computer, WINDEV proposes:

- the [Web Camera control](../WDChamp/1013188.md).

- [WLanguage functions](../WDLang1/3079003.md).




You have the ability to:

- view the video transmitted by a Web camera.

- save an image from the transmitted video in an image file (BMP, JPEG, etc.).

- save a section of the transmitted video in a video file.

- ...




**Remark**: To view a video in AVI format, use an [Image control](../WDChamp/1013218.md) and the [MCI functions](../WDLang1/3051010.md).

## Principle
<a name="principle_ELTTEXTE000191"></a>
To handle the videos:

1. Create a window containing a Web Camera control.

2. Display the description window of this control ("Description" in the context menu).

3. In this window, select the Web Camera to use. 
	**Remark**: The Web camera to use can also be specified through programming ([VideoSetDriver](../WDLang1/3079010.md)).

4. Through programming:

	- Display the video sequence being transmitted by the Web camera specified in the Web Camera control ([VideoDisplay](../WDLang1/3079004.md)).

	- Save (if necessary) the video currently transmitted by the specified Web camera as an image (BMP file) or as a video sequence (AVI file) with [VideoCapture](../WDLang1/3079007.md).

	- Modify (if necessary) the Web camera used ([VideoSetDriver](../WDLang1/3079010.md)).

	- Configure (if necessary) the video capture driver ([VideoConfigure](../WDLang1/3079009.md)).

	- List (if necessary) the video capture drivers installed on the current computer ([VideoListDriver](../WDLang1/3079008.md)).

	- Return (if necessary) the status of the Web Camera control ([VideoStatus](../WDLang1/3079006.md)).

	- Stop displaying or saving a video sequence in the Web Camera control ([VideoStop](../WDLang1/3079001.md)).

### Remarks
<a name="remarks_ELTPARAGRAPHE000091"></a>

- At runtime, the video sequence transmitted by the associated Web Camera is automatically displayed as soon as the window containing the Web Camera control is opened. In this case, there is no need to use [VideoDisplay](../WDLang1/3079004.md).

- If no Web camera was associated with the Web Camera control, [VideoDisplay](../WDLang1/3079004.md) and/or [VideoCapture](../WDLang1/3079007.md) handle the video sequence transmitted by the default Web camera (on the current computer).

- To save the video currently transmitted by the specified Web camera as an image file, you can use:

	- the [VideoCapture](../WDLang1/3079007.md) function.

	- [dSaveImageBMP](../WDLang1/3029026.md), [dSaveImageGIF](../WDLang1/3029040.md) and [dSaveImageJPEG](../WDLang1/3029038.md).
