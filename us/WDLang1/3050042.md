```wl
// Amount of interests due for the second year of a loan.

## Syntax

`<Result> = FinPeriodInterest([<Capital> [, <Rate> [, <Period> [, <Duration>]]]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Real or currency)`**

Amount of interests. This amount can be:

- negative: a payment must be made;

- positive: a credit must be made.




**`<Capital>: (Optional real or currency)`**

Amount of the loan (0 by default).

**`<Rate>: (Optional real)`**

Interest rate, expressed in percentage (1 by default). For example, for a 5% rate, this parameter will be set to 5.

**`<Period>: (Optional integer)`**

Period over which the amount of interests must be calculated (1 by default).

**`<Duration>: (Optional real)`**

Number of periods for the loan (1 by default).

## Remarks




### Time unit
<a name="time_unit_ELTPARAGRAPHE000078"></a>

The calculations can be performed according to months or years. &lt;Rate&gt;, &lt;Duration&gt; and &lt;Period&gt; must correspond to the same unit.

Therefore, to get the amount of interests due on the 5th month of a 3-year loan, with a yearly interest rate of 5%, you can use:

- units expressed in months (for a monthly payment for example):

	- &lt;Duration&gt; = 3 x 12 months = 36

	- &lt;Period&gt; = 5

	- &lt;Rate&gt; = 5% / 12




- units expressed in years (for a yearly payment for example):

	- &lt;Duration&gt; = 3 years

	- &lt;Period&gt; = 5/36

	- &lt;Rate&gt; = 5%
