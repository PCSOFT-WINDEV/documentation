## Example


```wl
// Create an event
Event_Letsgo is AutomaticEvent(eventClose)
// Run a first thread
ThreadExecute("Thread1", threadNormal, "Thread_First")
// Locks the current thread until the event is obtained
ThreadWaitSignal()

// Run a second thread
ThreadExecute("Thread2", threadNormal, "Thread_Second")
// Locks the current thread until the event is obtained
ThreadWaitSignal()

// Opens the event to run the threads
Event_Letsgo.Open()
```

```wl
PROCEDURE Thread_First()
Trace(dbgInfo(dbgProcess) + " - ThreadSendSignal(threadMain)")
ThreadSendSignal(threadMain)
Event_Letsgo.Wait()
Trace(dbgInfo(dbgProcess) + " - Event received")
```

```wl
PROCEDURE Thread_Second()
Trace(dbgInfo(dbgProcess) + " - ThreadSendSignal(threadMain)")
ThreadSendSignal(threadMain)
Event_Letsgo.Wait()
Trace(dbgInfo(dbgProcess) + " - Event received")
```

## Syntax

`<Result> = <Event>.Wait([<Maximum duration>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**



- 1 if the event was received by the thread,

- 0 otherwise (maximum duration exceeded).




**`<Event>: (AutomaticEvent variable)`**

Name of the [AutomaticEvent](../WDLang1/1000021270.md) variable that corresponds to the event to wait for.

**`<Maximum duration>: (Optional integer or optional Duration)`**

Maximum timeout in hundredths of a second. 

- If no signal was received by the thread before the end of specified duration, &lt;Result&gt; is equal to <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>. 

- The timeout is endless if this parameter is not specified. 

- If this parameter is set to 0, &lt;Result&gt; corresponds to the status of the event, without waiting.  


This parameter can correspond to: 

- an integer corresponding to the number of hundredths of a second,

- a Duration variable,

- the duration in a readable format (e.g., 1 s or 10 ms).

## Remarks
You can end the execution of a thread even if it is locked in an endless wait for an event. Simply use [ThreadStop](../WDLang1/3077019.md).
