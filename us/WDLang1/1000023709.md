Opens a document in a new (modeless) window using the appropriate WINDEV editor (word processor, spreadsheet, PDF reader or image editor).

Remarks: 

- Two syntaxes are available: 

	- open a document in blocking mode: the application is blocked until the window that displays the document is closed. 

	- open a document asynchronously: the application is not blocked when the document is opened. A WLanguage procedure is executed when the document is closed. This syntax requires the name of the WLanguage procedure to be executed. 




- To open the document without blocking the application and without specifying a WLanguage procedure, use [OpenDocumentAsynchronous](../WDLang1/1410088182.md).

## Example


```wl
sDocument is a string
sDocument = fSelect("C:\Directories", "File.docx", ...
       "Select a file", ...
       "Word file (*.docx)" + TAB + ".docx" + CR + "Spreadsheet (*.xlsx)" + TAB + ".xlsx")
IF OpenDocument(sDocument) = odFailure THEN
	Error("Unable to open the document.")
END
```

```wl
OpenDocument("MyDocument.docx", "My Document", odOptionNone, "", OpenDocument_Callback)

INTERNAL PROCEDURE OpenDocument_Callback(DocResult, nCR)
	SWITCH nCR
		CASE odOpenModified
			Info(DocResult + " has been modified")
		CASE odOpenNotModified
			Info(DocResult + " has not been modified")
		OTHER CASE
			Info(DocResult + " could not be opened")
	END
END

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

### Opening a document (blocking mode)

`<Result> = OpenDocument(<Document> [, <Title> [, <Options> [, <Password>]]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer constant)`**

Status report of document opening: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *odFailure* | The document was not opened. |
| *odOpenModified* | The document was opened and modified. |
| *odOpenNotModified* | The document was opened but it was not modified. |



**`<Document>: (Character string)`**

Document to open. Corresponds to:

- the full or relative path of document file to open.

- a buffer or an HFSQL memo containing the document to open. If the function returns the *odOpenModified* constant, the &lt;Document&gt; parameter will contain the buffer or HFSQL memo modified and saved in the document edit.

- a variable of type [Document](../WDLang1/1000022461.md), [xlsDocument](../WDLang5/1000017464.md) or [Image](../WDLang1/1000019650.md). If the function returns the *odOpenModified* constant, the &lt;Document&gt; parameter will contain the variable modified and saved during the document edit.




**`<Title>: (Optional character string)`**

Title of window opened to display the document. By default, this parameter corresponds to the title of current window. 

**`<Options>: (Optional Integer constant (or combination of constants))`**

Options for document opening:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *odOptionHidePane* | If the document is an image, it is displayed in the image editor and the right pane (that displays the color characteristics) is not displayed by default.  |
| *odOptionMaxWindow* | Document opened in read/write in a maximized window. |
| *odOptionNone*<br>(default value) | Document opened in read/write in a non-maximized window. |
| *odOptionReadOnly* | Document opened in read-only.  <br><br> |



**`<Password>: (Optional character string)`**



- Password to use if the file is protected,

- Empty string ("") if the file is not password-protected.

### Opening a document (asynchronously, non-blocking mode)

`<Result> = OpenDocument(<Document> , <Title> , <Options> , <Password> , <WLanguage procedure>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer constant)`**

Status report of document opening: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *odFailure* | The document was not opened. |
| *odOpenNotModified* | The document was opened but it was not modified. |



**`<Document>: (Character string)`**

Document to open. Corresponds to:

- the full or relative path of document file to open.

- a buffer or an HFSQL memo containing the document to open. If the function returns the *odOpenModified* constant, the &lt;Document&gt; parameter will contain the buffer or HFSQL memo modified and saved in the document edit.

- a variable of type [Document](../WDLang1/1000022461.md), [xlsDocument](../WDLang5/1000017464.md) or [Image](../WDLang1/1000019650.md). If the function returns the *odOpenModified* constant, the &lt;Document&gt; parameter will contain the variable modified and saved during the document edit.




**`<Title>: (Character string)`**

Title of window opened to display the document. By default, this parameter corresponds to the title of current window. 

**`<Options>: (Integer constant)`**

Options for document opening:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *odOptionHidePane* | If the document is an image, it is displayed in the image editor in read/write mode and the right pane (that displays the color characteristics) is not displayed by default.  |
| *odOptionMaxWindow* | Document opened in read/write in a maximized window. |
| *odOptionNone*<br>(default value) | Document opened in read/write in a non-maximized window. |
| *odOptionReadOnly* | Document opened in read-only. This constant can be combined with the *odOptionNone* and *odOptionMaxWindow* constants. <br><br> |



**`<Password>: (Character string)`**



- Password to use if the file is protected,

- Empty string ("") if the file is not password-protected.




**`<WLanguage procedure>: (Name of the procedure or lambda procedure)`**

Name of the WLanguage procedure ("callback") called after the document editing window is closed. For more details on this procedure, see [Parameters of the procedure used by OpenDocument](../WDLang1/1000024816.md). 

This WLanguage procedure can correspond to: 

- a name of a global procedure,

- a name of an internal procedure,

- a lambda procedure.
