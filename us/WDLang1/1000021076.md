The **GanttLink** type is used to define the advanced characteristics of a link between two tasks of a Gantt chart. The characteristics of this link can be defined and changed using different WLanguage properties. 

**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

## Example


```wl
// Retrieve all the links that point to "ID1"
arrLink is Array of GanttLink
arrLink = GanttListLink(COL_Gantt, "ID1")
Link is GanttLink
FOR EACH Link of arrLink
	Trace("Linked to " + Link.SourceID)
END
```

### Properties specific to GanttLink variables
<a name="properties_specific_ganttlink_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000028"></a>

The following properties can be used to handle a link between two Gantt tasks:

| **Property name** | **Type used** | **Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DestinationID | Character string | Identifier of the destination task. This identifier corresponds to the **ID** property defined in the [GanttTask](../WDLang1/1000020881.md) variable. |
| SourceID | Character string | Identifier of the source task. This identifier corresponds to the **ID** property defined in the [GanttTask](../WDLang1/1000020881.md) variable. |
| Type | Integer constant | Type of link. The available types of links are as follows: <br><br>- *gltStartToStart*: "Start to Start" link: The destination task cannot start as long as the source task is not started.<br><br>- *gltStartToEnd*: "Start to End" link: The destination task cannot end as long as the source task is not started (rare case).<br><br>- *gltEndToStart* (default value): "End to Start" link: The destination task cannot start as long as the source task is not ended. <br><br>- *gltEndToEnd*: "End to End" link: The destination task cannot end as long as the source task is not ended.<br><br><br> |

### Notes
<a name="notes_ELTPARAGRAPHE000071"></a>

- A link between 2 tasks is represented by an arrow.

- This type of variable: 

	- is used to add a link via [GanttAddLink](../WDLang1/1000021075.md), 

	- can be returned by [GanttListLink](../WDLang1/1000021079.md). 




- An "End to Start" link is created by default between two tasks: the task corresponding to the **SourceID** property must be finished before the **DestinationID** task can start. 

- According to their types, the links are drawn on the start or end borders of the tasks.

### Using GanttLink variables
<a name="using_ganttlink_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000090"></a>**GanttLink** variables are used by the following functions: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [GanttAddLink](../WDLang1/1000021075.md) | Creates an "End to Start" link between two tasks displayed in a Gantt Chart column found in a Table (or TreeView Table) control. |
| [GanttDeleteLink](../WDLang1/1000021080.md) | Removes links from a Gantt Chart column in a Table or TreeView Table control. |
| [GanttListLink](../WDLang1/1000021079.md) | Lists the links found in a Gantt Chart column found in a Table (or TreeView Table) control. |
