## Remarks


- By default, [SpreadsheetLoad](../WDLang1/1000021340.md) leaves the XLSX file open in write mode. When the document is saved, only the cells that have been changed in the Spreadsheet control are overwritten.. 

- To open the ".xlxs" file with another application, it must be closed with **SpreadsheetClose**.

- If no ".xlsx" file was opened, **SpreadsheetClose** has no action.

- This function can only be used on a Spreadsheet control found in a window.
