<a name="sample_code"></a>

## Example


```wl
arrValue is array of int = [1,2,3,4,5]
arrTriple is array of int

// Construct an array with the values multiplied by three
arrTriple = Map(arrValue, AValue => AValue * 3)
// arrTriple contains [3, 6, 9, 12, 15]
```



```wl
// -> apply lowercase to all the strings in the array
// (Prefix syntax)
arr1 is array of strings = ["A", "b", "C"]
arr1 = arr1.Map( X => Lower(X))
// arr1 = ["a", "b", "c"]
```

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = Map(<Source array> , <Operation to perform>)`
---

**`<Result>: (WLanguage array)`**

Array that contains the result of the procedure executed for each element of the &lt;Source array&gt;. 

**`<Source array>: (WLanguage array)`**

Name of the Array variable to use. This array must be a one-dimensional array.

**`<Operation to perform>: (WLanguage procedure)`**

Name of the WLanguage procedure to be executed for each element of the &lt;Source array&gt;. This procedure can be: 

- a global or local procedure,

- an internal procedure. 


It is also possible to directly use a lambda procedure.

## Remarks


### Operating mode
<a name="operating_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000072"></a>

The &lt;Operation to perform&gt; procedure is called for each element of the source array by passing this element as a parameter.

The results of all calls are stored in the &lt;Result&gt; array.



**Sequence of functions**
You can use array functions in a sequence. 
The following functions can be used in a sequence: 

- [Filter](../WDLang1/1000024845.md)

- [Map](../WDLang1/1000024734.md)

- [Union](../WDLang1/1000025408.md)

- [Intersect](../WDLang1/1000025407.md)

- [Distinct](../WDLang1/1000025406.md). 


This sequence can be used as a source for a FOR ALL statement or it can end with one of the following functions: 

- [Apply](../WDLang1/1000024856.md)

- [Reduce](../WDLang1/1000024744.md)

- [Min](../WDLang1/3050004.md)

- [Max](../WDLang1/3050005.md)

- [Sum](../WDLang1/1000019892.md)

- [Mean](../WDLang1/1000019891.md)

- [CheckAllFalse](../WDLang1/1000024858.md), [CheckAllTrue](../WDLang1/1000024857.md), [CheckAnyFalse](../WDLang1/1000024860.md), [CheckAnyTrue](../WDLang1/1000024859.md). 




Example: 

```wl
gnMean = garrUser.Filter(cbFilter).Map(cbMap).Mean()
```
