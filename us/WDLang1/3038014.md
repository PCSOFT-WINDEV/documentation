### Uppercase/Lowercase characters
<a name="uppercaselowercase_characters_ELTPARAGRAPHE000054"></a>

The window name can be written in uppercase or lowercase characters. The "~=" operator (flexible equality) should be used to compare the window name returned by **PreviousWin** with a hard-coded window name.

For example:


```wl
IF PreviousWin() ~= "EditWindow" THEN
	...
END
```
