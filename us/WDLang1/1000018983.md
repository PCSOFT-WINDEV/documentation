The **COMObject** type is used to represent an interface of a COM object. This type of variable is initialized by [COMCreateInstance](../WDLang1/1000018831.md).

Then, the methods of this interface can be called by [COMCallMethod](../WDLang1/1000018832.md).

**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md)

## Example


```wl
// Initialize a Unicode string containing 260 characters
WallPaper is Unicode string
WallPaper = AnsiToUnicode(RepeatString(" ", 260))

// Declare a COMObject variable
ActiveDesktop is COMObject

// Retrieve the interface for handling the desktop
ActiveDesktop = COMCreateInstance("75048700-EF1F-11D0-9888-006097DEACF9", ...
				"F490EB00-1240-11D1-9888-006097DEACF9")
IF ErrorOccurred = False THEN
	// Retrieve the image of the desktop wallpaper
	COMCallMethod(ActiveDesktop, 4, &WallPaper, 260, 1)
	Info("The image of the desktop is: " + UnicodeToAnsi(WallPaper))
END

| --- | --- |
| [COMCallMethod](../WDLang1/1000018832.md) | Runs a method of an interface of a COM object instantiated by [COMCreateInstance](../WDLang1/1000018831.md). |
| [COMCreateInstance](../WDLang1/1000018831.md) | Instantiates a COM object (Component Object Model). |
| [COMQueryInterface](../WDLang1/1000019784.md) | Calls the QueryInterface method of the specified COM object to get a specific interface of this object so that it can be used with [COMCallMethod](../WDLang1/1000018832.md). |
