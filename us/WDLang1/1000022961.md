One of the events associated with the window or page is "Request for refreshing the display". This event makes it possible to group the code for refreshing the controls of a window or page: content of controls, state (visible, grayed, etc.), caption to refresh, etc.

This event can receive parameters. Simply declare a procedure in the event. For example: 


```wl
// Request for refreshing the display
PROCEDURE AskForRefresh(RefreshType is Boolean)
```


This event is run upon request by the following functions: 

- [RequestUpdateUI](../WDLang1/1000021378.md): Runs the event "Request for refreshing the display" at the end of the current process (asynchronous execution).

- [ExecuteUpdateUI](../WDLang1/1000021379.md): Immediately executes the "Request for refreshing the display" event. 

- **RequestRefreshUIParent**: Executes the "Request for refreshing the display" event of the higher level at the end of the current process (asynchronous execution).

- [ExecuteUpdateUIParent](../WDLang1/1000022961.md): Immediately executes the "Request for refreshing the display" event of the higher level.


When these functions are called, you can specify the value of the parameters expected by the event.
