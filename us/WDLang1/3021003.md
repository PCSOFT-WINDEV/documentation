## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000390"></a>
Your applications use several system dialog boxes? A specific skin template is used in your project? Why not customize these windows and give them the "appearance" of your application?

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) You can now use AAFs in dialog boxes. This is a great addition for users who are familiar with AAFs 

WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile allow you to use:

- System windows. 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) System windows with AAFs. 
	Remark: Starting with version 28 U1 (version 280075), this feature is available by default for new projects.

- Custom windows, integrated into the project: 

	- "WINDEVMESSAGEBOX" and "WINDEVDIALOGBOX" (WINDEV projects). 

	- "WINDEVMOBILEMESSAGEBOX" and "WINDEVMOBILEDIALOGBOX" (WINDEV Mobile projects). 


 These windows are system information windows (dialog boxes) that can be customized and used in all your applications.




No code is required. Regardless of the mode chosen, the [Warning](../WDLang1/3021009.md), [Info](../WDLang1/3021011.md), [YesNo](../WDLang1/3021005.md), [OKCancel](../WDLang1/3021004.md), [Confirm](../WDLang1/3021007.md), [Error](../WDLang1/3021013.md) and [Dialog](../WDLang1/3021015.md) functions automatically use the display mode according to the configuration used.

**Remarks**: 

- By default, in a new project (version 28 and later): 

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) dialog boxes use AAFs.




- The characteristics of system dialog boxes are: 

	- gray background.

	- icon indicating the type of information displayed.

	- standard buttons.




- By integrating custom windows into the project, you can create multilingual dialog boxes (images, button labels, etc.). By default, these windows support French, English, German, Spanish, Italian, Dutch and Portuguese. For more details, see ["Multilingual dialog boxes"](#NOTE3_1).




For more details, see [Dialog box](../WDLang1/3021012.md).

### Using the "system" windows with Automatic Application Features (AAFs)
<a name="using_the_system_windows_with_automatic_application_features_aafs_ELTPARAGRAPHE000099"></a>

To use "system" information windows with AAFs:

1. Open the project description window: on the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, click "Description".

2. Display the "Style" tab. 

3. In "Info, YesNo, Confirm, and Dialog system windows (WINDEV configurations)", select "With AAFs". 

4. Validate. 




These windows replace the standard system information windows (displayed by [Warning](../WDLang1/3021009.md), [Confirm](../WDLang1/3021007.md), [Dialog](../WDLang1/3021015.md), [Error](../WDLang1/3021013.md), [Info](../WDLang1/3021011.md), [OKCancel](../WDLang1/3021004.md), [YesNo](../WDLang1/3021005.md)).

End users will be able to use AAFs In these windows: ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=fonctions_dialogue%20-%20HC%20N%B0010.gif)


Remarks: 

- System windows are replaced by preset, non-customizable windows. 

- System windows with AAFs use English, Spanish and French. For other languages, you will need to fully customize dialog windows. 







### Customizing the system information windows
<a name="customizing_the_system_information_windows_ELTPARAGRAPHE000161"></a>

To customize the system information windows:

1. Open the project description window: on the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, click "Description".

2. Display the "Style" tab.




If you use WINDEV:  

1. In "Info, YesNo, Confirm, and Dialog system windows (WINDEV configurations)", select "Custom (integrated into the project)". 

2. Validate. An internal component named "WDAAF" is automatically included in your project (if it does not already exist). This component contains the "WINDEVMESSAGEBOX" and "WINDEVDIALOGBOX" windows. The skin template of your project is applied to these windows.




If you use WiINDEV Mobile:  

1. Check "Customize Info, YesNo, Confirm, and Dialog system windows (Android and iOS configurations)". 

2. validate. An internal component named "WMFAA" is automatically integrated into your project (if necessary). This component contains the "WINDEVMOBILEDIALOGBOX" and "WINDEVMOBILEMESSAGEBOX" windows. The skin template of your project is applied to these windows.}




These custom windows replace the standard information windows (displayed using [Warning](../WDLang1/3021009.md), [Confirm](../WDLang1/3021007.md), [Dialog](../WDLang1/3021015.md), [Error](../WDLang1/3021013.md), [Info](../WDLang1/3021011.md), [OKCancel](../WDLang1/3021004.md) and [YesNo](../WDLang1/3021005.md)).

Remark: to no longer use custom windows: 

1. Change the options in the project description to use non-custom windows. 

2. Delete the windows that correspond to the message boxes of the internal component ("Remove and delete from disk" in the context menu of the "Project explorer" pane). 

3. If necessary, delete also the "WDAAF" or "WMAAF" internal component (if empty). 

4. If necessary, delete the files corresponding to the "WINDEVxxxMESSAGEBOX" and "WINDEVxxxDIALOGBOX" windows from the project directory.

### Tips
<a name="tips_ELTPARAGRAPHE000303"></a>

- Do not modify the code of the "WINDEVxxxMESSAGEBOX" and "WINDEVxxxDIALOGBOX" windows, nor the code of their controls.

- Don't delete any control.

- If you add controls to the "WINDEVxxxMESSAGEBOX" and "WINDEVxxxDIALOGBOX" windows, make sure there is no code associated with those controls.

- Limit changes to the style of windows and their controls, and test all changes made.
