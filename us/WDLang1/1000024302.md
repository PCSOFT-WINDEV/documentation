Seeks the index of an element in a WLanguage array. The following searches can be performed:

- Seek an element in a one-dimensional array of simple elements.

- Seek an element in a two-dimensional array of simple elements according to a column.

- Seek an element in a two-dimensional array of simple elements according to several columns.

- Seek an element in a one-dimensional array of structures or classes.

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Seek an element in an array of records.

- Seek an object in an array.

## Example


```wl
arrMyArray is array of 0 string 
// Fill the array
arrMyArray.Add("WINDEV")
arrMyArray.Add("WEBDEV")
arrMyArray.Add("WINDEV and WEBDEV")
// Find "WINDEV"
ResIndex is int
ResIndex = arrMyArray.Seek(asLinearFirst, "WINDEV")
Info("The WINDEV string is found at index: " + ResIndex)
// Returns: "The WINDEV string is found at index: 1"
```

## Syntax

### Seek an element in a one-dimensional array of simple elements

`<Result> = <WLanguage array>.Seek(<Type of search> , <Sought value> [, <Start index>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**



- Index of the sought element,

- -1 if the element is not found in the array.




**`<WLanguage array>: (Array)`**

Name of the Array variable to use. This array must be a one-dimensional array.
This array can also correspond to a one-dimensional array associated with a property of advanced variable.

**`<Type of search>: (Integer constant)`**

Type of search to perform:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *asBinary* | Binary search. <br>This search mode is fast but it must be used on an array sorted in ascending order, without duplicates. <br>Search options (lexicographical order, ignore punctuation, etc.) must be exactly the same for the search (**&lt;Array&gt;.Seek**) and for the sort ([&lt;Array&gt;.Sort](../WDLang1/1000024318.md)). |
| *asLinear* | Linear search. The search starts:<br><br>- from the first element.<br><br>- from the value of the parameter &lt;Start index&gt;.<br><br><br>The search stops as soon as an element is found. |
| *asLinearFirst* | Linear search from the first element. &lt;Start index&gt; is ignored when this constant is specified. |
| *asLinearLast* | Linear search from the last element. This constant must not be used if &lt;Start index&gt; is specified. |
| *asLinearNext* | Linear search for the next element. This search is performed from the current position or the value of &lt;Start index&gt;. |
| *asLinearPrevious* | Linear search for the previous element. This search is performed from the current position or the value of &lt;Start index&gt;. |


The type of search can be combined with one or more search options:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *tccIgnoreAccent* | Search ignoring accented characters.<br>This option can only be used on the arrays of character strings.<br> |
| *tccIgnoreCase* | Search ignoring the case.<br>This option can only be used on the arrays of character strings. |
| *tccIgnoreInsideSpace* | Search ignoring spaces inside strings.<br>This option can only be used on the arrays of character strings. |
| *tccIgnorePonctuationAndSpace* | Search ignoring spaces and punctuation.<br>This option can only be used on the arrays of character strings.<br> |
| *tccIgnoreSpace* | Search ignoring spaces at the beginning and end of strings.<br>This option can only be used on the arrays of character strings. |
| *tccLexicographicOrder* | Array sorted according to the linguistic order.<br>This option is useful for a dichotomous search and it has no effect on a linear search.<br>This option can only be used on the arrays of character strings.<br> |
| *tccRespectNumeric* | Array sorted according to the order of numeric values.<br>This option is useful for a dichotomous search and it has no effect on a linear search.<br>This option can only be used on the arrays of character strings.<br> |

Value of element whose index is requested.

**`<Start index>: (Optional integer)`**

## Remarks


### Special cases
<a name="special_cases_ELTPARAGRAPHE000938"></a>

- This function cannot be used on the fixed arrays.

- This function can be used on the arrays of advanced variables. 

- This function cannot be used on the array of "Dynamic objects". The type of the objects must be specified. 

- This function must be used on the arrays of objects with a defined **type**.

	- For example, no search can be performed in the following array: 
			
		```wl
		t is array of 2 objects dynamic
		```


	- On the contrary, a search can be performed in the following array:
			
		```wl
		t is array of 2 MyClass
		```

			
		```wl
		t is array of 2 MyClass dynamic
		```





- No search can be performed on an array of variants.

- ![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) If the type of the search is dichotomous and if the array is not sorted, no WLanguage error will be displayed but the result of the search will be undefined.
