## Syntax

`SetFocusAndReturnToUserInput([<Element to handle>])`
---

**`<Element to handle>: (Optional control, window or page name)`**

Name of control, column or window that will gain focus (see Notes). If this parameter is not specified, the current control gains focus.

To specify a control that belongs to a window other than the current window, &lt;Element to handle&gt; must be in the following format: &lt;Window name&gt;.&lt;Control name&gt;.

## Remarks




### Focus gain
<a name="focus_gain_ELTPARAGRAPHE000075"></a>

Taking "focus" is represented in different ways:

- Blinking cursor (or "Caret") for the edit controls.

- Dotted rectangle for the other types of controls (Button, List Box, Radio Button controls, etc.).



<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>




### ScreenFirst, SetFocus and SetFocusAndReturnToUserInput
<a name="screenfirst_setfocus_and_docparampagetitleshort_ELTPARAGRAPHE000086"></a>

These functions have a different behavior:

- **SetFocusAndReturnToUserInput** stops the current process to force the input in the specified control. 

- [ScreenFirst](../WDLang1/3025039.md) defines which control will receive input focus (when the current code stops and input focus is set back to a control).

- [SetFocus](../WDLang1/3025001.md) stops the current process, defines which control will receive input focus and resumes the current process.

### Error
<a name="error_ELTPARAGRAPHE000105"></a>

A WLanguage error occurs if &lt;Element to handle&gt; does not correspond to a control in the current window or page.

### SetFocusAndReturnToUserInput on a window
<a name="docparampagetitleshort_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000114"></a>

If &lt;Element to handle&gt; corresponds to the name of a window, the window becomes active. The control that will gain focus in this window will correspond to:

- the last control previously in edit in this window,

- the first control that can gain focus in this window (if no data was previously entered).

### SetFocusAndReturnToUserInput on a Table control column
<a name="docparampagetitleshort_table_control_column_ELTPARAGRAPHE000127"></a>

**SetFocusAndReturnToUserInput** sets the focus on the specified column. If the Table control is not receiving any input, it becomes editable.

### SetFocusAndReturnToUserInput on the current control
<a name="docparampagetitleshort_the_current_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000139"></a>

**SetFocusAndReturnToUserInput** used without parameters sets the focus on the current control. This function, called in the exit code of an Edit control, is used to force the input in the selected control if the data entered and the expected data do not match.

### Events/processes executed when SetFocusAndReturnToUserInput is called
<a name="eventsprocesses_executed_when_docparampagetitleshort_called_ELTPARAGRAPHE000182"></a>

The WLanguage code that follows the call to **SetFocusAndReturnToUserInput** is not executed and control is given to the user. 

**Special cases**:

- if **SetFocusAndReturnToUserInput** is called in a code called by [Execute](../WDLang1/3013041.md), [ExecuteCode](../WDLang1/1000019783.md) or [ExecuteProcess](../WDLang1/3013031.md), the code called by [Execute](../WDLang1/3013041.md), [ExecuteCode](../WDLang1/1000019783.md) or [ExecuteProcess](../WDLang1/3013031.md) is interrupted. The execution resumes after the call to [Execute](../WDLang1/3013041.md), [ExecuteCode](../WDLang1/1000019783.md) or [ExecuteProcess](../WDLang1/3013031.md). 

- if **SetFocusAndReturnToUserInput** is called in the code of a function of a window other than the current one, the code of this function is interrupted and execution resumes after the call.

- if **SetFocusAndReturnToUserInput** is called in the code of a component (procedure or method), the code is interrupted and execution resumes after the call to the procedure or method.

- if **SetFocusAndReturnToUserInput** is called in the code of a procedure of an internal window, the code is interrupted and execution resumes after the call to the procedure.

- if **SetFocusAndReturnToUserInput** is called in the code of a menu option, the code is interrupted and execution resumes after the call to the option.

- if **SetFocusAndReturnToUserInput** is called in a window procedure called from a supercontrol, the code is interrupted and execution resumes after the call to the procedure.

- if **SetFocusAndReturnToUserInput** is called in the code of a procedure of a supercontrol or control template, the code is interrupted and execution resumes after the call to the procedure.




The current process is permanently interrupted. For example:


```wl
SetFocusAndReturnToUserInput(EDT_Edit1)
Info("XXX")    // Is never run
```


In most cases, the exist events (from the current control or window) and the input events (in the specified control or window) are run at the same time as **SetFocusAndReturnToUserInput**.

Exceptions:

- No code is executed if &lt;Element to handle&gt; is the current control.

- The exit code of the selected control is not run if **SetFocusAndReturnToUserInput** is used in one of the events of this control.




To avoid interrupting the process, use [ScreenFirst](../WDLang1/3025039.md) or [SetFocus](../WDLang1/3025001.md).

![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) The WLanguage code that follows the call to **SetFocusAndReturnToUserInput** is not executed. The execution of processes resumes:

- when the user gets the control back. 

- during the call to [Execute](../WDLang1/3013041.md) or [ExecuteProcess](../WDLang1/3013031.md).

### SetFocusAndReturnToUserInput and END:
<a name="docparampagetitleshort_and_end_ELTPARAGRAPHE000284"></a>

After a call to **SetFocusAndReturnToUserInput**, the code that follows [the "END:" statement](../Motscles/1510014.md) is not executed. **SetFocusAndReturnToUserInput** can be replaced with the call to [ScreenFirst](../WDLang1/3025039.md) followed by RETURN.
