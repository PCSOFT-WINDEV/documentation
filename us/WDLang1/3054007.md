- ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WDChainedList.gif) ***Training (WINDEV)*** : **WD ChainedList** <br>This example supplies the tools required to build chained lists (simple sequencing). This type of list is used to store and browse a set of values in an organized way.<br><br>In the example, a chained list is used to store buttons. <br>- The list is then used to hide/move the buttons in the screen, creating a dynamic menu (Sidebar).<br>- The list is also used to translate the buttons without having to reload the window. To do so, the French caption and the English caption are stored for each button. The advantage of this method is to keep the status of the window, especially the menu in its drop-down aspect, the information text, and so on.<br><br>Specific feature of this example:<br>- this example is a multilingual example (French/English).
