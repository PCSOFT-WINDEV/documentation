## Syntax

### Writing a value identified by its name into a registry

`<Result> = RegistrySetValue([<Access mode>, ] <Key path> , <Value name> , <Value> [, <Length>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the value was written, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) with the *errMessage* constant.




**`<Access mode>: (Integer constant)`**

Registry access mode:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *registryMode32* | Forced mode to access the registry as a 32-bit program. |
| *registryMode64* | Forced mode to access the registry as a 64-bit program. |
| *registryModeAuto*<br>(Default value) | Automatic registry access mode: <br><br>- a 32-bit application running on a 32-bit system manipulates the registry as a 32-bit program.<br><br>- a 32-bit application running on a 64-bit system manipulates the registry from the following branch:<br>	<br><pre><code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node</code></pre><br><br><br>- a 64-bit application running on a 64-bit system manipulates the registry as a 64-bit program.<br><br><br> |



**`<Key path>: (Character string)`**

Full path of key to use. This key must exists in order for a value to be given to it.

**`<Value name>: (Character string)`**

Name of the value to write. If the value does not exist, it will be created. 

**`<Value>: (Character string, integer, real or pointer)`**

Value to write. This value must not directly correspond to a numeric edit control for example. A typed variable must be used (declared as real, character string, ...).

**`<Length>: (Optional integer)`**

Length of the value to write when &lt;Value&gt; corresponds to a pointer.

## Remarks


### Types of written data
<a name="types_written_data_ELTPARAGRAPHE000164"></a>

If &lt;Type of value&gt; is not used, the data written into the registry has a specific type according to &lt;Value&gt;. If &lt;Value&gt; corresponds to:

- a character string, the value written will be a string key (REG_SZ).

- an integer, the value written will be a REF_WORD.

- a real or a currency, the value written will be a binary key.

- a pointer, with &lt;Length&gt; corresponding to its length, the value written will be a binary key.

### Handling the registry in Windows Vista (and later)
<a name="handling_the_registry_windows_vista_and_later_ELTPARAGRAPHE000176"></a>

In Windows Vista, if the [UAC mechanism](../Editeurs/2025014.md) is enabled, you must have administrator rights to write to the "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE" key.

If the user does not have the necessary rights, the UAC mechanism performs a redirection to "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Classes\\VirtualStore\\MACHINE\\SOFTWARE". The purpose of this redirection is to ensure the compatibility of the applications. The keys written in this directory can be read by the application that has written them.  

**Reminder**: When creating the executable, a manifest can be included in the executable so that administrator rights are granted to the application.

### Limitations of the RegistrySetValue function
<a name="limitations_the_docparampagetitleshort_function_ELTPARAGRAPHE000190"></a>

**RegistrySetValue** has no effect on "(default)" entries. These are specific entries. To reach these entries, the name of the key must be replaced by an empty string.

**Example**:

Don't:


```wl
RegistrySetValue("HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.jar", "(default)", "myfile")
```


Do:


```wl
RegistrySetValue("HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.jar", "myfile")
```
