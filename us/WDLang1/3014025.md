The debugging functions are as follows:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [dbgAssert](../WDLang1/3014022.md) | Used to find out and signal the possible errors via an assertive programming. |
| [dbgAuditOption](../WDLang1/1000018837.md) | Retrieves or modifies the options of the dynamic audit. |
| [dbgAuditStatus](../WDLang1/1000018836.md) | Retrieves and changes the status of the dynamic audit. |
| [dbgCheckDifferent](../WDLang1/1000019777.md) | Checks whether the specified expressions are different in assertive programming and in automated test mode. |
| [dbgCheckEqual](../WDLang1/1000019776.md) | Checks whether the expressions are equal in assertive programming and in automated test mode. |
| [dbgCheckFalse](../WDLang1/1000019781.md) | Checks whether an expression is false in assertive programming and in automated test mode. |
| [dbgCheckNotNull](../WDLang1/1000019779.md) | Checks whether an expression is not Null in assertive programming and in automated test mode. |
| [dbgCheckNull](../WDLang1/1000019778.md) | Checks whether an expression is Null in assertive programming and in automated test mode. |
| [dbgCheckTrue](../WDLang1/1000019780.md) | Checks whether an expression is set to True in assertive programming and in automated test mode. |
| [dbgConnect](../WDLang1/1000024735.md) | Used to connect a remote debugger to an application, service, Webservice, etc. |
| [dbgEnableAssert](../WDLang1/3014021.md) | Enables or disables the assertive programming. |
| [dbgEnableAudit](../WDLang1/1000018835.md) | Enables the dynamic audit through programming. |
| [dbgEnableLog](../WDLang1/1000017137.md) | Enables the runtime log programmatically. |
| [dbgEndMemoryDiff](../WDLang1/1000018841.md) | Saves a memory dump containing the memory resources that have been allocated and that have not been freed since the previous call to [dbgStartMemoryDiff](../WDLang1/1000018840.md). |
| [dbgEndRecording](../WDLang1/1000017161.md) | Stops recording the scenario. |
| [dbgError](../WDLang1/1000020526.md) | Provokes: <br><br>- an assertion during the test of element or project (Go mode). <br><br>- an error in automated test mode. <br><br><br> |
| [dbgInfo](../WDLang1/3014024.md) | Returns a debug information. |
| [dbgLogOption](../WDLang1/1000017136.md) | Retrieves or modifies the options of the runtime log. |
| [dbgLogStatus](../WDLang1/1000017138.md) | Returns and modifies the status of runtime log. |
| [dbgOnError](../WDLang1/1000020722.md) | Defines the WLanguage procedure that will be called whenever an error is detected by a dbgCheckXXX function. |
| [dbgSaveDebugDump](../WDLang1/1000018834.md) | Saves a dump file of the application. |
| [dbgSaveMemoryDump](../WDLang1/1000018852.md) | Saves a dump of memory used by the application. |
| [dbgStandardOutput](../WDLang1/3014020.md) | Writes an information into the standard output stream "stdout" (also called "console"). |
| [dbgStartMemoryDiff](../WDLang1/1000018840.md) | Starts a difference operation of the memory used by the application. |
| [dbgStartRecording](../WDLang1/1000017160.md) | Starts recording a test scenario (also called reproduction scenario). |
| [dbgWriteCommentAudit](../WDLang1/1000018839.md) | Writes a comment into the current dynamic audit. |
| [dbgWriteWarningAudit](../WDLang1/1000018838.md) | Writes a custom runtime warning into the dynamic audit. |
