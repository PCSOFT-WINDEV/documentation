## Syntax

`dbgWriteWarningAudit(<Code> [, <Warning Text>])`
---

## Remarks
[dbgAuditStatus](../WDLang1/1000018836.md) is used to find out whether the audit is enabled in order to: 

- perform the checks in this case only. 

- avoid reducing the performances of the application in standard execution.
