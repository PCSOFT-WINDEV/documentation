Deserializes a buffer or a character string containing the data from a class, structure, array (including an associative array), queue, stack, list or advanced variable ([gglCalendar](../WDLang5/1000017418.md), for example), as well as their subelements.

## Example


```wl
// This example explains how to use the Serialize/Deserialize functions
// with an Array variable. 
// These functions can use all types of WLanguage variables.

MyArray is array of strings
bufResult is Buffer

// Adds elements into the array
Add(MyArray, "WINDEV")
Add(MyArray, "WEBDEV")
Add(MyArray, "WINDEV MOBILE")

// Serialize the array in the buffer in JSON
// => Save the array and its entire content in a JSON string
Serialize(MyArray, bufResult, psdJSON)

// Deserialize the JSON buffer
// => Rebuild the WLanguage array from the JSON string
MyRebuiltArray is array of strings
Deserialize(MyRebuiltArray, bufResult, psdJSON)
```

## Syntax

`Deserialize(<Variable> , <Buffer> , <Parameters>)`
---

**`<Variable>: (Type of variable)`**

Structure, class, array, queue, list or stack variable. 

- For a structure or a class, this variable must be allocated. 

- For an array, a queue, a list or a stack, this variable is automatically allocated during the deserialization.




The deserialization will be performed in this variable.

**`<Buffer>: (Ansi character string or buffer)`**

Variable that contains the serialized data. A variable name must be specified.

**`<Parameters>: (Integer constant)`**

Type of deserialization (must correspond to the type chosen for the serialization):

## Remarks


### Deserialization
<a name="deserialization_ELTPARAGRAPHE000146"></a>

The deserialization of an array, a queue or a stack deletes the content of the element.

If there are additional members in the structure or in the class:

- if a structure or a class is deserialized: additional members keep their values from before the deserialization.

- if an array of structures or classes is deserialized: additional members take the default value of the member type.




If there are additional members in the serialized buffer, they are ignored during the deserialization.

To deserialize an untyped dynamic array, it must be allocated beforehand.

To deserialize a class or a structure containing an untyped dynamic array, this array must be allocated beforehand.

The wd280xml.dll or wp280xml.dll library is necessesary to deserialize an XML document.

An advanced variable that was serialized with a French version of the product (and whose names and properties are in French in the serialization buffer) can be deserialized by an English version of the product (and conversely).

In the advanced variables:

- the read-only properties cannot usually be deserialized.

- the write-only properties cannot usually be serialized.


Special cases are noted in the documentation for each type.

![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) In order for the serialization format to be compatible between the WINDEV applications and the WINDEV Java applications, the names of the following serialized elements must contain no special character and no accented character: 

- classes,

- arrays of classes,

- structures,

- array of structures.

### Speed
<a name="speed_ELTPARAGRAPHE000200"></a>

Binary deserialization is faster than XML deserialization.
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Limitations
<a name="limitations_ELTPARAGRAPHE000207"></a>

- Fixed and associative arrays of local structures cannot be deserialized.

- Global members of classes are not serialized/deserialized.

- The XML serialization/deserialization of an array of structures with a string member containing "\\0" or Charact(0) returns the following error: "Wrong serialization format". In this case, a binary serialization/deserialization must be performed.

- You cannot serialize/deserialize an array of class or structure if this class or structure contains a dynamic array without type. A dynamic array with defined type must be used in this class or in this structure.

- To serialize/deserialize a class, you must have a constructor without mandatory parameter.

- ![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) You cannot serialize/deserialize Queue, Stack or List variables.

- Only JSON serialization is available for [Record](../WDLang4/1000020962.md) variables. No deserialization is possible. 

- **Error handling**: **Deserialize** returns no error code. If an error occurs, the [ErrorOccurred](../WDLang1/3087001.md) variable is set to <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>.
