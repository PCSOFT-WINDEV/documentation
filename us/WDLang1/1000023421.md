Refreshes the display of a TreeView control from a given position. 

**Remark**: **&lt;TreeView&gt;.Display** can be used on:

- a TreeView control based on a data file. In this case, the changes made to the linked data file are reflected in the TreeView control.

- a TreeView control populated programmatically. 

- a single-selection or multi-selection TreeView control.

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<TreeView control>.Display([<Position>])`
---

**`<TreeView control>: (Control name)`**

Name of the TreeView control to be refreshed.

**`<Position>: (Integer, character or constant (optional))`**

Indicates the start position for the refresh. If this parameter is not specified:

- ***For a TreeView control based on a data file***, the function behaves like if the *taInit* constant was passed as parameter.

- ***For a TreeView Table control populated programmatically***, the function has no effect.




This parameter can correspond to:

- An integer. The refresh is performed from this position. The selected row is not modified.
	***For a TreeView control based on a data file***, the "Display a row" event for the &lt;Position&gt; row is executed. The current element in the TreeView control is the same as the current record in the data file.
	***For a TreeView Table control populated programmatically***, the &lt;Position&gt; row is re-displayed.

- A character or a constant: 
	

|   | TreeView control with in-memory data source | TreeView control populated programmatically |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *taCurrentSelection* | <br><br>	- Re-displays the TreeView control.<br><br>	- The selected row is unchanged.<br><br><br> | <br><br>	- Re-displays the TreeView control.<br><br>	- The selected row is unchanged.<br><br><br> |
| *taCurrentRecord* | <br><br>	- Re-runs the linked query if necessary.<br><br>	- Takes into account the records added, modified or deleted by other computers.<br><br>	- Selects the current record.<br><br>	- The scrollbar position is stored as long as the selection remains visible.<br><br>	- Runs the "Initializing" and "End of initialization" events of the control, then the "Select a row" event for the selected row (even if it is not modified).<br><br><br> | No effect. |
| *taStart* | <br><br>	- Refreshes the TreeView control by setting the position at the beginning of the control.<br><br>	- The first row is selected. This row corresponds to the first record.<br><br><br> | No effect. |
| *taInit* | <br><br>	- Runs the initialization code of the TreeView control (initialization code and end of initialization code).<br><br>	- Fills the TreeView control.<br><br>	- The first row of the TreeView control is selected. This row corresponds to the current record at the end of the initialization code of the TreeView control.<br><br><br> | No effect. |
| *taReExecuteQuery* | <br><br>	- Re-runs the query linked to the TreeView control.<br><br>	- Refreshes the TreeView control by setting the position at the beginning of the control.<br><br>	- The first row of the TreeView control is selected. This row corresponds to the first record.<br><br><br>**Caution**: Only the query linked to the TreeView control is run. If specific options have been specified with [&lt;Source&gt;.ExecuteQuery](../WDLang4/1000024944.md) (*hModifyFile*, for example), these options are ignored. | No effect. |
