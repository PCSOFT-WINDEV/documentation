Changes the position of a widget found in a Dashboard control. This widget is already configured or displayed.

DashMoveWidget(1, 1)
```

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

### Moving the current widget

`DashMoveWidget(<X> , <Y> [, <Options>])`
---

**`<X>: (Integer)`**

Horizontal position of current widget in number of cells or in pixels. The first cell is cell [1, 1].
 The value in pixels is rounded to correspond to an integer number of cells.

The widget used corresponds to the control to which the current event belongs (Widget or control belonging to the widget). 

**`<Y>: (Integer)`**

Vertical position of current widget in number of cells or in pixels. The first cell is cell [1, 1]. 
The value in pixels is rounded to correspond to an integer number of cells.

The widget used corresponds to the control to which the current event belongs (Widget or control belonging to the widget). 

**`<Options>: (Optional Integer constant)`**

Allows you to define the unit used and the reorganization mode: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *dashNoReorganization* | Moves the Widget without reorganizing the adjacent widgets.<br><br>Caution: Using the *dashNoReorganization* constant may produce an incorrect display (with overlapping widgets). When using this constant, it is important to entirely reorganize the Dashboard control with [DashResizeWidget](../WDLang1/1000021286.md) and **DashMoveWidget**. |
| *dashUnitCell*<br>(Default value) | The unit used when moving the widget is a number of cells. |
| *dashUnitPixel* | The unit used when moving the widget is the pixel. |

### Moving a widget identified by its index

`DashMoveWidget(<Dashboard control> , <Widget index> , <X> , <Y> [, <Options>])`
---

**`<Dashboard control>: (Control name)`**

Name of the Dashboard control to be used.

**`<Widget index>: (Integer)`**

Index of the widget to use. This index corresponds to:

- the addition number of the widget defined in the window editor or in the page editor.

- the addition number of widget returned by [DashAddWidget](../WDLang1/1000020953.md).




**`<X>: (Integer)`**

Horizontal position of widget in number of cells or in pixels. The first cell is cell [1, 1]. The value in pixels is rounded to correspond to an integer number of cells.

**`<Y>: (Integer)`**

Vertical position of widget in number of cells or in pixels. The first cell is cell [1, 1]. The value in pixels is rounded to correspond to an integer number of cells.

**`<Options>: (Optional Integer constant)`**

Allows you to define the unit used and the reorganization mode: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *dashNoReorganization* | Moves the Widget without reorganizing the adjacent widgets.<br><br>Caution: Using the *dashNoReorganization* constant may produce an incorrect display (with overlapping widgets). When using this constant, it is important to entirely reorganize the Dashboard control with [DashResizeWidget](../WDLang1/1000021286.md) and **DashMoveWidget**. |
| *dashUnitCell*<br>(Default value) | The unit used when moving the widget is a number of cells. |
| *dashUnitPixel* | The unit used when moving the widget is the pixel. |

## Remarks


### Rule used for calculating cells
<a name="rule_used_for_calculating_cells_ELTPARAGRAPHE000178"></a>

Let's see some examples for a widget whose size is equal to 100 px by 100 px with a margin set to 10 px: 


```wl
DashMoveWidget(DASH_TimeZones, 1, 80, 80, dashUnitPixel)
// The widget will be positioned in cell 1 x 1

DashMoveWidget(DASH_TimeZones, 1, 160, 200, dashUnitPixel)
// The widget will be positioned in cell 2 x 2

DashMoveWidget(DASH_TimeZones, 1, 211, 211, dashUnitPixel)
// The widget will be positioned in cell 3 x 3

DashMoveWidget(DASH_TimeZones, 1, 400, 500, dashUnitPixel)
// The widget will be positioned in cell 4 x 5
```
