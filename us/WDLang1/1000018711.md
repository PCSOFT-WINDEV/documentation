### EndService and EndProgram functions
<a name="endservice_and_endprogram_functions_ELTPARAGRAPHE000055"></a>

In a service: 

- **EndService** ends the execution of the service by performing the following operations: 

	- configuring the execution of the closing codes

	- simulating a service failure, which triggers OS failure recovery actions (automatic restart, or reboot in Windows, for example). 




- [EndProgram](../WDLang1/3013033.md) can be used with the following specific features:

	- the message is ignored.

	- closing codes are run (or not) depending on the boolean specified as the last parameter.

	- the service ends normally and no failure is simulated.







In an application, **EndService** can be used with the following specific features:

- no message is displayed when exiting the application. 

- closing codes are run (or not) depending on the specified closing option. 

- the failure option has no effect.
