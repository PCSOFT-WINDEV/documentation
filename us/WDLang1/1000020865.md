## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000076"></a>
WINDEV allows the user to perform a search among all the texts found in a window or in a control. 

The calculation can be performed: 

- via the Automatic Application Feature for searching in a window. For more details, see [Search in a window](../Editeurs/9500101.md). 

- via the WLanguage search functions.
