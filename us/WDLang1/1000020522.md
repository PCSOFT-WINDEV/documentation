<a name="sample_code"></a>

## Example


```wl
// Name of file to track
sFileName is string = "C:\Temp\MyDir\MyFile.extension"
// The ProcessModification procedure will be called when the 
// "C:\Temp\MyDir\MyFile.extension" file is modified.
IF fTrackFile(sFileName, fTrackFile_Callback, ...
		ftCreateFile + ftModifyFile + ftDeleteFile +  ...
		ftRename) THEN
	// Inform the user that the file will be tracked
	Info("The " + sFileName + " file will be tracked.")
ELSE
	// Inform the user that the file will not be tracked
	Info("The " + sFileName + " file will not be tracked.")
END

// Code of the procedure
INTERNAL PROCEDURE fTrackFile_Callback(sFullName, sFileName, nAction, sOldFileName)
	sActionDesignation is string
	// The designation of the action depends on nAction
	SWITCH nAction
		CASE ftCreateFile: sActionDesignation = "Creating files"
		CASE ftDeleteFile: sActionDesignation = "Deleting files"
		CASE ftModifyFile: sActionDesignation = "Modifying files"
		CASE ftRename: sActionDesignation = "Renaming files"
	END
	// Add a line containing the information about the modification 
	// in the TABLE_MODIFICATIONS control
	TableAddLine(TABLE_MODIFICATIONS, sFullName, sFileName, ...
		sActionDesignation, sOldFileName)
END
```

`<Result> = fTrackFile(<File to track> , <WLanguage procedure> [, <Modifications to notify>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the tracking of the file is enabled, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md).




**`<File to track>: (Character string)`**

Full name of the file to track.

**`<WLanguage procedure>: (Procedure name)`**

Name of the WLanguage procedure ("callback") called when a change is made to the specified file.

For more details on this procedure, see [Parameters of the procedure used by fTrackFile](../WDLang1/1000025349.md). 

**`<Modifications to notify>: (Optional Integer constant (or combination of constants))`**

Modifications performed in the file to track and for which the procedure must be run: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *ftAll* | All the possible actions will be tracked. Corresponds to *ftCreateFile* + *ftModifyFile* + *ftRename* + *ftDeleteFile*. |
| *ftCreateFile* | The &lt;Name of modified file&gt; file was created. |
| *ftDeleteFile* | The &lt;Name of modified file&gt; file was deleted. |

## Remarks


### Special cases
<a name="special_cases_ELTPARAGRAPHE000076"></a>

- To stop tracking the file, use [fTrackStop](../WDLang1/1000020575.md) and [fTrackStopAll](../WDLang1/1000020576.md).

- To track the modifications performed on the content of a directory, use [fTrackDirectory](../WDLang1/1000020523.md).

- Limitations: 

	- Only 5 files can be tracked at the same time.

	- You cannot track a file found at the root of a disk (for performance reasons).

### WLanguage procedure
<a name="wlanguage_procedure_ELTPARAGRAPHE000097"></a>

The WLanguage procedure is run in a WLanguage thread.
Caution: The following processes cannot be run in the threads:

- opening windows with WLanguage functions such as [Open](../WDLang1/3038035.md), [Use](../WDLang1/3038044.md), [Close](../WDLang1/3038018.md), ... A specific management mode must be implemented if some windows must be handled in threads (rare case). For more details, see [Opening a window in a secondary thread](../WDLang1/3077015.md). 

- managing events.

- managing timers.




For more details on threads, see [Managing threads](../WDLang1/3077026.md).
