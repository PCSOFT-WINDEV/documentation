Deletes an element at a given position:

- from a one-dimensional WLanguage array.

- from an advanced array property (array of gglCalendar events, etc.).

- from an associative array.

- from a WLanguage list. 




The array size is automatically reduced.

**Remarks**: 

- This function is equivalent to [Delete](../WDLang1/1000017354.md).

## Example


```wl
MyArray is array of 2 strings
MyArray[1] = "WINDEV"
MyArray[2] = "WEBDEV"
// Delete the 1st element
ArrayDelete(MyArray, 1) // Deletes "WINDEV" 
// Display the 1st element
Trace(MyArray[1])  // Displays "WEBDEV"
```
<a name="Example2"></a>

```wl
// Associative array Last Name - First Name
aaLastNameFirstName is associative array of strings 
ArrayInsert(aaLastNameFirstName, "Smith", "Tommy")
ArrayInsert(aaLastNameFirstName, "Montgomery", "Julia")
ArrayDelete(aaLastNameFirstName, "Smith")
// Deletion during a browse
sLastName is string
sFirstName is string
FOR EACH ELEMENT sFirstName, sLastName OF aaLastNameFirstName
	Trace(sFirstName + ": " + sLastName)
	ArrayDelete(aaLastNameFirstName, CurrentElement)
END
```

## Syntax

### Deleting an element from a WLanguage array or from an advanced array property

`<Result> = ArrayDelete(<WLanguage array> , <Element index>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**

Number of deleted elements (always corresponds to 1).

**`<WLanguage array>: (Array)`**

Name of the Array variable to use. This array must be a one-dimensional array.

**`<Element index>: (Integer or Integer constant)`**



- Index of the element to be deleted. A WLanguage error occurs if this parameter is greater than the number of array elements.  

- The following constants can be used:
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *CurrentElement* | The current element is deleted. This constant is used to delete the current element during a FOR EACH browse.<br><br>This constant is only available for associative arrays. |
| *FirstElement* | The first array element is deleted. |

### Deleting an element from an associative array

`<Result> = ArrayDelete(<WLanguage array> , <Element key>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**

Number of deleted elements:

- 1 or 0 for the associative arrays without duplicates.

- 0 to N for the associative arrays with duplicates.




**`<WLanguage array>: (Associative array)`**

Name of Associative Array variable to use.

**`<Element key>: (Integer)`**



- Value of key corresponding to the element to delete.

	- **In an associative array without duplicate**: If the element exists, it is deleted ; if the element does not exist, no operation is performed.

	- **In an associative array with duplicates**: If the element exists, all the &lt;Element Key&gt; elements are deleted ; if the element does not exist, no operation is performed.




- This parameter can also correspond to the *CurrentElement* constant. This syntax is used to delete the current element during a FOR EACH browse.

### Deleting an element from a list

`<Result> = ArrayDelete(<WLanguage list> , <Element index>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**

Number of deleted elements (1 for the lists).

**`<WLanguage list>: (List)`**

Name of List variable to use.

**`<Element index>: (Integer constant)`**

Index of the list where the element will be deleted. The following constants can be used: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *CurrentElement* | The current element is deleted. For a list, this constant is available when browsing the list elements (during a FOR EACH browse). |
| *FirstElement* | The first element found in the list is deleted. |
| *LastElement* | The last element found in the list is deleted. |

## Remarks


### Deleting the last element
<a name="deleting_the_last_element_ELTPARAGRAPHE000214"></a>

If the last element is deleted, the array is resized to 0. The array has not been deleted: new additions can be performed without re-creating the array.
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Miscellaneous
<a name="miscellaneous_ELTPARAGRAPHE000225"></a>

This function cannot be used with the fixed arrays.
