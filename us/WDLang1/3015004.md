Allows you to:

- define a timeout,

- give control back to Windows,

- give control back to Windows and to WLanguage.

## Example


```wl
// Calculation loop
FOR i = 1 TO 10000
	CalculationProcedure(i)
	// Give control back to the system in order to display the results
	Multitask()
END
// Wait 1 second 
Multitask(100)
```

## Syntax

`Multitask([<Timeout>])`
---

**`<Timeout>: (Optional integer or optional Duration)`**



- **Define a timeout**: &lt;Timeout&gt; = positive integer. 
	The execution of the application is interrupted during &lt;Timeout&gt; hundredths of a second without giving control back to the system. The mouse clicks and the actions performed on the keyboard keys are ignored by the application. For example, the window can be moved but it cannot be resized.
	The [optional processes](../WDChamp/1014004.md) of controls are always run.
	**Remark**: If &lt;Timeout&gt; = 1, the application gives control back to Windows without waiting during 1 hundredth of a second.
	![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) The modification of window size is not ignored. On the contrary, the mouse clicks and the actions on the keyboard keys are ignored.
	![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) The positive values are not allowed.

- **Give control back to the system**: &lt;Timeout&gt; = 0 or is not specified. 
	The system ends the current processes, gives control back to the WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile application, then takes into account the clicks and the actions performed on the keyboard keys.
	![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) **Multitask** has no effect if &lt;Timeout&gt; = 0.
	

- **Give control back to Windows and to the WLanguage**: &lt;Timeout&gt; = negative integer. 
	The execution of the application is interrupted during &lt;Timeout&gt; hundredths of a second. Other processes can be run during this time period (redisplaying or running a click code for example). The interactions with the users (mouse click, keystroke, ...) are processed as usual. 
	**Remark**: If &lt;Timeout&gt; = -1, the application gives control back to Windows without waiting during 1 hundredth of a second.


Remark: This parameter can correspond to: 

- an integer corresponding to the number of hundredths of a second,

- a Duration variable,

- the duration in a readable format (e.g., '1s' or '10cs').

### Example of timeout
<a name="example_timeout_ELTPARAGRAPHE000131"></a>

The user presses the Esc key before or during the call to **Multitask**:

- if &lt;Timeout&gt; is positive: The Esc key is ignored.

- if &lt;Timeout&gt; is equal to 0: The Esc key is taken into account at the end of current WINDEV processes.

- if &lt;Timeout&gt; is negative: The Esc key is immediately taken into account.

### Tips
<a name="tips_ELTPARAGRAPHE000145"></a>

- To refresh the UI, use [MultitaskRedraw](../WDLang1/3038004.md).

- The events and timers started before the execution of **Multitask** are managed during the timeout.

- In a Service application, **Multitask** must be replaced with [ServiceWait](../WDLang1/1000018712.md).

### Note
<a name="note_ELTPARAGRAPHE000165"></a>

It is recommended to use [ThreadPause](../WDLang1/3077029.md) instead of **Multitask** or [Timeout](../WDLang1/3015012.md) when using multiple threads (including the main thread of the application) if the timer does not need to process user actions.
