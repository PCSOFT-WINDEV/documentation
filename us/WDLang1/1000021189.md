**`<Subscript>: (Integer)`**

## Remarks


- When deleting options from a Radio Button control, the size of the control is not modified. The control size can be changed using the [Width](../Proprietes/2510059.md) and [Height](../Proprietes/2510050.md) properties.

- You have the ability to compact the options in order to optimize the aspect of the control once options have been deleted. 
	In compacted mode, the options of a Radio Button control move closer: 

	- when an option is made invisible. 

	- when an option is deleted.




- To use the compacted mode: 

	- check "Compact invisible options" in the "Details" tab of the control description.

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) use the [CompactOption](../Proprietes/1000020608.md) property. 




- When an option is deleted, if the radio button uses option numbering, the options following the deleted option are automatically renumbered. 

- Only the index of the option to delete can be specified. If the radio button uses returned values, you cannot specify the name of the option to delete. However, you can specify the index that corresponds to the option.
