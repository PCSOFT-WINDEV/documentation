---

**`<TreeView Table control>: (Control name)`**

Name of the TreeView Table control to be used.

If this parameter corresponds to an empty string (""), the TreeView Table control used is the control to which the current event belongs.

**`<First element to swap>: (Integer or character string)`**

First branch that will be used for the swap. This branch can be identified: 

- by the index of the branch to move. This index must be between 1 and the number of rows in the TreeView Table control (returned by the [TableCount](../WDLang1/3074021.md) function or the [Count](../Proprietes/2510097.md) property). 

- by the path of the element to move. This parameter has the following format: 
	
	```txt
	"<Root name>" + TAB + ["<Name of 1st node>" + TAB + ...
	["<Name of 2nd node>" + TAB + [...]]]"<Leaf name>"
	```





**`<Second element to swap>: (Integer or character string)`**
