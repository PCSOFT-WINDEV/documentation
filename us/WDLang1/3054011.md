## Transforming a project into a multilingual project
<a name="transforming_project_into_multilingual_project_ELTTEXTE000855"></a>
This page presents the main steps to make your projects support multiple languages: 

- [Choosing the different languages](#NOTE1_2). 

- [Taking into account the language when creating a control](#NOTE1_3). 

- Translating the different elements: 

	- [Without specific tools](#NOTE1_4).

	- [With WDINT and WDMSG](#NOTE1_5).




- [Displaying the interface in a specific language in the editors](#NOTE1_6). 

- [Testing in different languages](#NOTE1_7). 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) [Creating the executable file](#NOTE1_8).




Caution: You must also manage the particular cases of various default windows and pages. For more details, see [Special case: Translating the windows and pages proposed by default](#NOTE2_1).

### 1. Choosing the different languages
<a name="1_choosing_the_different_languages_ELTPARAGRAPHE000052"></a>


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| <br><br>- **Project**<br><br><br> | You can select the languages of the project in the project description:<br><br>1. On the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, click "Description".<br><br>2. Select the "Languages" tab and click "Add". <br><br>3. The selected languages are taken into account for all elements (open elements are automatically closed).<br><br><br> |
| <br><br>- **Windows, pages, reports and controls (text, input masks and images)**<br><br><br> | The different project languages are automatically managed. <br>Elements shared between projects that use different languages: when the element is opened in one of the projects, the additional languages are automatically added. |
| <br><br>- **Help system (hlp or chm)**<br><br><br> | The different project languages are automatically managed. <br>Help systems shared between projects that use different languages: when the element is opened in one of the projects, the additional languages are automatically added. |
| <br><br>- **Messages in the code (code, procedures, classes)**<br><br><br> | The different project languages are automatically managed.<br>Classes and procedures shared between projects: when the element is opened in one of the projects, the additional languages are automatically added. . |


<a name="NOTE1_3"></a>


### 2. Creating a new control
<a name="2_creating_new_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000096"></a>




|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| <br><br>- **Windows, pages, reports and controls (text, input masks and images)**<br><br><br> | By default, only the caption of runtime language is specified. The caption of the control must be translated into the supported languages. |
| <br><br>- **Help system (hlp or chm)**<br><br><br> | The title of the new pages and the keywords are automatically created in English. |


<a name="NOTE1_4"></a>


### 3. Translation without specific tool (in WINDEV directly)
<a name="3_translation_without_specific_tool_windev_directly_ELTPARAGRAPHE000111"></a>


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| <br><br>- **Windows, pages, reports and controls (text, input masks and images)**<br><br><br> | Text must be translated in all window, page, report and control descriptions. |
| <br><br>- **Help system (hlp or chm)**<br><br><br> | For the summary and the indexes: the translation must be performed in the description windows of the page. <br>For the content of help page: the translation must be performed after the change of display language. |
| <br><br>- **Messages in the code (code, procedures, classes)**<br><br><br> | The translation must be performed in the message editor (Ctrl + T). |


<a name="NOTE1_5"></a>


### 3 b. Translating messages with WDMSG/WDINT

### Windows of AAF (Automatic Application Features)
<a name="windows_aaf_automatic_application_features_ELTPARAGRAPHE000756"></a>

Some AAFs (Automatic Application Features) use specific windows. These windows can be included in the application to be translated. List of main features that require a specific integration in order to be translated: 

- [Scheduler control](../WDChamp/1000019498.md) and [Organizer control](../WDChamp/1016329.md): Ability to customize and translate the appointment window. 

- [Organization Chart control](../WDChamp/1000019822.md): Ability to customize and translate the window of elements.

- [Locking the application](../WDLang6/3061101.md): Ability to customize and translate the lock window. 

- [Managing the keyboard shortcuts](../Editeurs/9500108.md): Ability to customize and translate the shortcut window. 

- [Displaying a line of an edit control](../Editeurs/9500120.md): Ability to customize and translate the input window of a given line. 

- [Defining a timer](../Editeurs/9500100.md): Ability to customize and translate the timer settings window. 

- [Multi-control search](../Editeurs/9500101.md): Ability to customize and translate the search window.

- [History of modifications](../WDLang4/3044344.md): Ability to customize and translate the history window.

- [Calculator](../Editeurs/9500122.md): Ability to customize the calculator and translate its options.

- [Automatic print of Scheduler controls](../WDChamp/1000019561.md): Ability to customize and translate the print settings window.

- [Automatic print of Organizer controls](../WDChamp/1016327.md): Ability to customize and translate the print settings window.





- ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WDChainedList.gif) ***Training (WINDEV)*** : **WD ChainedList** <br>This example supplies the tools required to build chained lists (simple sequencing). This type of list is used to store and browse a set of values in an organized way.<br><br>In the example, a chained list is used to store buttons. <br>- The list is then used to hide/move the buttons in the screen, creating a dynamic menu (Sidebar).<br>- The list is also used to translate the buttons without having to reload the window. To do so, the French caption and the English caption are stored for each button. The advantage of this method is to keep the status of the window, especially the menu in its drop-down aspect, the information text, and so on.<br><br>Specific feature of this example:<br>- this example is a multilingual example (French/English).
