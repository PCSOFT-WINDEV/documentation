***In french: TimerSys***

<a name="Use"></a>
<a name="description"></a>
Periodically and automatically calls a WLanguage procedure. Called in the procedure, **TimerSys** is used to identify the timer that started the procedure.

The sequence of periodic calls to a procedure is called timer. This periodic call will be stopped by [EndTimerSys](../WDLang1/3015009.md).

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Automatic procedures can be used instead of **TimerSys**. For more details, see the [automatic procedures](../Editeurs/9000072.md).

## Example


```wl
// Procedure used to display the time in EDT_Time1 on a regular basis
PROCEDURE Display_Time()
EDT_Time1 = TimeSys()

// Process when opening the window
// Display_Time will be called every second
IF TimerSys("Display_Time", 100, 1) = 0 THEN
	Error("Unable to create the timer")
END
```

## Syntax

### Starting a procedure periodically

`<Result> = TimerSys(<WLanguage procedure> , <Period> [, <Number>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**



- Number of the opened timer (&lt;Number&gt; if this parameter is specified),

- 0 if the timer was not opened.




**`<WLanguage procedure>: (Procedure name)`**

Name of WLanguage procedure that will be started periodically.

Remark: If this parameter corresponds to the name of an internal procedure, the name of internal procedure must not be enclosed between quotes. 

**`<Period>: (Integer)`**

Time (in hundredths of a second) between two calls to the procedure by timer. The period precision depends on the pending system status.
This parameter can correspond to: 

- an integer corresponding to the number of hundredths of a second,

- a Duration variable,

- the duration in a readable format (e.g., 1 s or 10 ms). 




**`<Number>: (Optional integer)`**

Number imposed to the timer. If this parameter is specified, the timer number will be the selected number. If this number corresponds to an existing timer, it will be stopped and replaced with the new timer.

### Finding out the timer number

`<Result> = TimerSys()`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**

Number of the timer that called the current procedure.

## Remarks




### Differences between the Timer and TimerSys functions
<a name="differences_between_the_timer_and_timersys_functions_ELTPARAGRAPHE000115"></a>

- [Timer](../WDLang1/3015008.md) allows you to use a timer managed by WINDEV or WINDEV Mobile. In this case, the frequency of the call is calculated from the moment when the call to the timer was performed.

- **TimerSys** allows you to use a timer managed by the system. In this case, the frequency of the call is calculated from the end of the procedure execution.




**Tip**: In most cases, use **TimerSys**. 
Indeed, [Timer](../WDLang1/3015008.md) consumes more resources than **TimerSys** and it operates only when WINDEV/WINDEV Mobile windows are displayed (the timer stops if a message box is displayed).
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Process for calling the timer
<a name="process_for_calling_the_timer_ELTPARAGRAPHE000138"></a>

- Code of the project:

	- If **TimerSys** is called in a project code, the timer is associated with the project. The timer is interrupted by [EndTimerSys](../WDLang1/3015009.md) and when the execution of the application is over. The procedure called by the timer must be:

		- a procedure global to the project: 
						
			```txt
			TimerSys("<global procedure>", 1000)
			```


		- a static method of a class: 
						
			```txt
			TimerSys("<class>::<static method>", 1000)
			```





- If **TimerSys** is used in the opening process of project and if no window is opened, the timer will be valid for the entire project. It is in a pending status and it will be automatically triggered as soon as a window is opened or during the calls to [Multitask](../WDLang1/3015004.md). 

- Code of a window, control or local procedure:
	If **TimerSys** is called in the code of a window, one of its controls or local procedures, the timer is associated with the window. The timer is interrupted by [EndTimerSys](../WDLang1/3015009.md) and when closing the window. The procedure called by the timer must be:

	- a local procedure of the window: 
			
		```txt
		TimerSys("<local procedure>", 1000)
		```


	- a procedure global to the project: 
			
		```txt
		TimerSys("<global procedure>", 1000)
		```


	- a static method of a class: 
			
		```txt
		TimerSys("<class>::<static method>", 1000)
		```





- Code of a static method of a class:
	If **TimerSys** is called in a static method of a class, the timer is associated with the class. The timer is interrupted by [EndTimerSys](../WDLang1/3015009.md) and when the execution of the application is over. The procedure called by the timer must be:

	- a static method of the class: 
			
		```txt
		TimerSys ("::<static method>", 1000)
		```


	- a static method of another class: 
			
		```txt
		TimerSys("<class>::<static method>", 1000)
		```


	- a procedure global to the project: 
			
		```txt
		TimerSys("<global procedure>", 1000)
		```





- Code of an object method:
	If **TimerSys** is called in a method of an object, the timer is associated with the object. The timer is interrupted by [EndTimerSys](../WDLang1/3015009.md), when freeing the object and when closing the window. The procedure called by the timer must be:

	- a non-static method of the object: 
			
		```txt
		TimerSys(":<method>", 1000)
		```


	- a static method of the object class: 
			
		```txt
		TimerSys ("::<static method>", 1000)
		```


	- a static method of another class: 
			
		```txt
		TimerSys("<class>::<method>", 1000)
		```


	- a procedure global to the project: 
			
		```txt
		TimerSys("<global procedure>", 1000)
		```

### Locking or non-locking operations
<a name="locking_nonlocking_operations_ELTPARAGRAPHE000222"></a>

- A timer is not locked when opening menus, when opening a window, when opening the windows associated with [Warning](../WDLang1/3021009.md), [Confirm](../WDLang1/3021007.md), [Error](../WDLang1/3021013.md), [Info](../WDLang1/3021011.md), [OKCancel](../WDLang1/3021004.md) and [YesNo](../WDLang1/3021005.md).

- A timer is locked when the windows are moved or resized.

### Execution time of procedure
<a name="execution_time_procedure_ELTPARAGRAPHE000248"></a>

If the time used to process the procedure called by the timer is greater than the time requested between each call to the procedure, the calls to the timer do not pile up: there will be a single pending call.

### Timer and sibling windows
<a name="timer_and_sibling_windows_ELTPARAGRAPHE000257"></a>

When the same window that manages a timer is opened several times (sibling windows in MDI mode), **TimerSys** must be used with no timer number. Therefore, a timer number will be automatically assigned to each window.

### Timer and Thread
<a name="timer_and_thread_ELTPARAGRAPHE000269"></a>

A procedure started by [Timer](../WDLang1/3015008.md) or **TimerSys** from a secondary thread ([ThreadExecute](../WDLang1/3077024.md)) will not be called. Indeed, a secondary thread has no interface (which means no opened window): this secondary thread does not receive the messages from the system (the "message loop") like the main application thread.
<a name="NOTE0_7"></a>
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) 

### Timer and Windows service
<a name="timer_and_windows_service_ELTPARAGRAPHE000286"></a>

To use **TimerSys** from a [Windows service](../WDLang1/1000017114.md), this function must be called from a window opened by the service code. 

**Caution**: This solution is not recommended. To repeat a process from a service, we advise you to call this process from the code of the service (the code of the service being run in loop).
