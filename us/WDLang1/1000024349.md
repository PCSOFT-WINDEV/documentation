Indicates that the drawing functions that will be used are intended for the specified Image control. 

**Remark**: **&lt;Image variable&gt;.StartDrawing** initializes all the parameters required to create a drawing for a given element.

![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) **Caution**: A specific configuration is required to use this function in Linux. For more details, see [The drawings](../WDLang1/3029035.md).

## Example


```wl
// Start drawing in the "IMG_ImageDrawing" control
ResDrawing = IMG_ImageDrawing.StartDrawing()
// Drawings performed in the "IMG_ImageDrawing" control
...
// End of drawing in the "IMG_ImageDrawing" control
```

```wl
IMG_Image1.StartDrawing()
IMG_Image1.Font("Arial", 12, iNormal, 0)
IMG_Image1.DrawText(4, 0, "I'm writing in an Image control!")
```

## Syntax

`<Result> = <Image variable>.StartDrawing([<Options>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the drawing was initialized,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise.




**`<Image variable>: (Image variable)`**



**`<Options>: (Optional Integer constant (or combination of constants))`**

Drawing options:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *dGridlinesOpacity* | The drawing is displayed over gridlines in order to highlight the transparent or semi-transparent sections of the drawing. The gridlines are not saved in the image.<br>![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png)![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This constant is not available. |
| *dNoErase* | Does not erase the drawing in the variable. |
| *dOnChart* | Used to draw in a variable in which a chart has already been drawn. In this case, the chart drawing is not erased.<br>![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png)![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This constant is not available. |
| *dWithOpacity* | Allows managing opacity in the different drawing functions used with the variable. Used for example to create a PNG drawing with an Alpha channel. |


No drawing option is used if this parameter is not specified.

## Remarks


### Use in prefix syntax
<a name="use_prefix_syntax_ELTPARAGRAPHE000444"></a>

- **&lt;Image variable&gt;.StartDrawing** must be called before the other drawing functions. **&lt;Image variable&gt;.StartDrawing** makes it possible to define the drawing options used in the Image control.

- \* When drawing in an Image control: 

	- the drawing functions operate on a copy ("bitmap") of image. You can use the drawing functions of Windows (via [API](../WDLang1/3014005.md) or [CallDLL32](../WDLang1/3014003.md)) but these Windows functions must use the DC (Device Context) returned by **&lt;Image variable&gt;.StartDrawing**.

	- [&lt;Image&gt;.EndDrawing](../WDLang1/1000024327.md) and **&lt;Image variable&gt;.StartDrawing** must not be called in the same process. The drawing will not be displayed if [&lt;Image&gt;.EndDrawing](../WDLang1/1000024327.md) and **&lt;Image variable&gt;.StartDrawing** are called in the same process: it will be automatically erased.

### Drawing with opacity
<a name="drawing_with_opacity_ELTPARAGRAPHE000585"></a>

By creating a drawing that supports opacity, you can easily save PNG images with an Alpha channel.

**To save a PNG drawing with an Alpha channel**:

1. Use the **&lt;Image variable&gt;.StartDrawing** function. This function is used to define, if necessary, the element onto which the drawing functions will be applied as well as the drawing mode. The *dWithOpacity* constant is used to indicate that the drawing will manage the opacity. The *dGridlinesOpacity* constant is used to display gridlines underneath the different drawing areas.

2. Configure the opacity of your drawings with the following functions:
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [&lt;Image&gt;.Background](../WDLang1/1000023999.md) | Declares the background color and its opacity for the next drawings. |
| [&lt;Image&gt;.DrawPoint](../WDLang1/1000024006.md) | Declares the color of the points and their opacity for the next drawings. |
| [&lt;Image&gt;.Pen](../WDLang1/1000024016.md) | Declares the color of the lines and their opacity for the next drawings. |


	**Remark**: [&lt;Image&gt;.PixelOpacity](../WDLang1/1000024336.md) is used to find out the opacity of a point.

3. Use [&lt;Image&gt;.SavePNG](../WDLang1/1000024345.md) to save your drawing in PNG format with alpha channel (opacity).




**Limit**: In "Management of opacity" mode, [&lt;Image&gt;.DrawText](../WDLang1/1000024017.md) is limited to the use of True Type fonts.
