The **docElementImage** type is used to handle the characteristics of an Image element found in a [docElement](../WDLang1/1000022484.md) variable. 

The characteristics of **docElementImage** variable can be handled by several WLanguage properties. 

**CAUTION: This type cannot be used directly. It must be used via the [docElement](../WDLang1/1000022484.md) type**.

**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

## Example


```wl
// Inserts an image cursor location
// Select the image file
sFile is string 
sFile = fImageSelect(fCurrentDir(), "", ...
	"Insert an image","JPEG (*.JPG)" + TAB + "*.jpg" + CR + ...
	"PNG (*.PNG)" + TAB + "*.png" + CR + "All files (*.*)" + TAB + "*.*")
	
IF sFile = "" THEN
	RETURN
END

// The image file is transferred into an Image variable
img is Image
img = sFile

// Declare an Image element (that will be inserted into the document)
elt is docElement
elt.Type = typeDocElementImage
elt.Image.BufferImage = img
elt.Image.Wrapping = docWrappingAlignedOnText


// Calculate the width and height of the image found in the element
// The image size is expressed in pixels in the Image variable. 
// This size is converted into mm in the element (unit used in a document)
elt.Image.Width = img.Width * 25.4 / 96.0
elt.Image.Height = img.Height * 25.4 / 96.0
// Image position
elt.Image.X = 0
elt.Image.Y = 0
	
DocInsert(WP_MyDocument, WP_MyDocument.Cursor, elt)
```

### Properties specific to the description of docElementImage variables
<a name="properties_specific_the_description_docelementimage_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000041"></a>

The following properties can be used to handle a **docElementImage** variable:


| Property name | Type used | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Height | Real | Image height in millimeters. <br><br>Caution: the unit used is the millimeter instead of the pixel (not enough precision). Don't forget to convert (if necessary) the image height from pixels to millimeters. |
| ImageBuffer | [Image](../WDLang1/1000019650.md) | Image buffer. |
| ImageLink | Character string | Link to the Image file. The actual image will not be integrated into the document, but only a link to the image. |
| Width | Real | Width of the image in millimeters.<br><br>Caution: the unit used is the millimeter instead of the pixel (not enough precision). Don't forget to convert (if necessary) the image width from pixels to millimeters. |
| Wrapping | Integer constant | Type of image wrapping: <br><br>- *docWrappingAlignedOnText*: The image inserted into the line and it is linked to the text location where it was inserted. It is processed like any character. It moves with the text. <br><br>- *docWrappingThrough*: Used to customize the wrapping. <br><br>- *docWrappingBehindTheText*: Allows you to use the image in watermark behind the text.<br><br>- *docWrappingBeforeTheText*: Used to display the image above the text. <br><br>- *docWrappingFramed*: Wraps the text around the image border (recommended for a square image).  <br><br>- *docWrappingTopAndBottom*: The image remains on its line and it is located between two text sections at the top and at the bottom.<br><br>- *docWrappingNear*: Wraps the image according to its outlines (recommended for a round image or for an image with an irregular shape). <br><br><br> |
| X | Real | X-position of the image in relation to its anchoring point (in millimeters). <br><br>This property is used only for images for which the **Wrapping** property is set to a constant other than *docWrappingAlignedOnText*. |
| Y | Real | Y-position of the image in relation to its anchoring point (in millimeters). <br><br>This property is used only for images for which the **Wrapping** property is set to a constant other than *docWrappingAlignedOnText*. |
| ZOrder | Integer | Number corresponding to the Z-order of the image. <br><br>This property is automatically modified when [DocChangeZOrder](../WDLang1/1000023970.md) is used. |
