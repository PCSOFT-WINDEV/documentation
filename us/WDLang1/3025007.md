Each parameter is identified by a name. These values are saved at the location defined in the configuration window.<br>3°) The optimization<br>	This window explains how to optimize your code to avoid the slowness caused when the saved values are restored. Indeed, when restoring the value of a control, its modification code is run. If you have long processes (queries with parameters for instance), this window shows you how to speed up the loading of the window.
