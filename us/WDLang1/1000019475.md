## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000172"></a>
A mutex is used to limit the simultaneous execution of a code (procedure, line of code, etc.) to one thread at a given time. A mutex can be shared between several applications. 

**Remark**: Other systems can also be used to protect a code section: 

- **semaphores** are used to limit the simultaneous execution of a code (procedure, line of code, etc.) **to one or more threads** at a given time. A semaphore can be shared between several applications. 

- critical sections are used to limit the simultaneous execution of a code (procedure, line of code, etc.) **to one thread** at a given time in a single application.

## Principle
<a name="principle_ELTTEXTE000196"></a>
The mutex was created by [MutexCreate](../WDLang1/1000019022.md).

1. Thread #1 runs [MutexStart](../WDLang1/1000019023.md): there is no thread in the mutex.

2. Thread #1 runs the code section protected by the mutex.

3. While thread #1 runs the code protected by the mutex, thread #2 runs [MutexStart](../WDLang1/1000019023.md): since the code protected by the mutex is being run by thread #1, thread #2 must wait for the mutex to be released.

4. Thread #1 runs [MutexEnd](../WDLang1/1000019024.md): no other thread runs the mutex code.

5. Thread #2 can run the code protected by the mutex.

6. Thread #2 runs [MutexEnd](../WDLang1/1000019024.md): no other thread runs the mutex code.

## How to implement a mutex?
<a name="how_implement_mutex_ELTTEXTE000220"></a>


### Steps:
<a name="steps_ELTPARAGRAPHE000073"></a>

The different steps for implementing a mutex are as follows:

1. Creating a mutex with [MutexCreate](../WDLang1/1000019022.md). The mutex is associated with a name.

2. Calling [MutexStart](../WDLang1/1000019023.md) before the code section to protect.

3. Calling [MutexEnd](../WDLang1/1000019024.md) to define the code section to protect. The lines of code after [MutexEnd](../WDLang1/1000019024.md) will no longer be protected.

4. Destroying the mutex with [MutexDestroy](../WDLang1/1000019025.md).

### Remarks
<a name="remarks_ELTPARAGRAPHE000100"></a>

- The code sections protected by a mutex must be as short as possible and they must only affect the "critical" processes.

- When a thread is pending, the resources of the processor are not used.

- A mutex can be applied to the main thread and to the secondary threads (created by [ThreadExecute](../WDLang1/3077024.md)). You must avoid locking the main thread. Indeed, if the main thread is locked (pending), the application cannot be run anymore.

- [MutexStart](../WDLang1/1000019023.md) and [MutexEnd](../WDLang1/1000019024.md) must be used in the same process (in a procedure for example).

- A mutex can be shared (or not) between the different applications run on the computer. When creating a mutex, specify how it will be shared ([MutexCreate](../WDLang1/1000019022.md)).

### Functions for managing a mutex
<a name="functions_for_managing_mutex_ELTPARAGRAPHE000122"></a>The following WLanguage functions are used to manage mutexes:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [MutexCreate](../WDLang1/1000019022.md) | Explicitly creates a mutex. |
| [MutexDestroy](../WDLang1/1000019025.md) | Explicitly destroys a mutex. |
| [MutexEnd](../WDLang1/1000019024.md) | Signals that the thread frees the mutex. |
| [MutexStart](../WDLang1/1000019023.md) | Locks the current thread while waiting for the mutex to be freed. |
