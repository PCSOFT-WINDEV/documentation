Modifies the shape currently displayed in a Shape control to get a custom shape (by specifying the coordinates of polygon points). 

Allows you to create your own shapes (to create charts for example).

## Example


```wl
T1 is array of int = [5,5,5,505,505,505,505,5]
ShapePolygon(SHA_NoName1, T1)
```



```wl
arrPoints is array of int = ...
[10,10,
1000,10,
1000,800,
900,800,
700,1000,
750,800,
10,800]

ShapePolygon(SHA_NoName1, arrPoints)

SHA_NoName1.BackgroundColor = PastelOrange
SHA_NoName1.Color = DarkOrange
```

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`ShapePolygon(<Shape control> , <Points>)`
---

**`<Shape control>: (Control name)`**

Shape control to use. 

**`<Points>: (Array of integers or array of points)`**

Array ot integers or array of [Point](../Motscles/1000018908.md) variables containing the waypoints of polygon. 

If this array is an array of integers, the even subscript represent the X-coordinates while the odd subscripts represent the Y-coordinates of points.

<a name="NOTE0_1"></a>

## Remarks
The X and Y positions are relative to the control size and they are expressed in 1/1000.

The initial shape is included in an area identified by a marker from (0,0) to (1000, 1000). The coordinates of the points in the new shape must be given according to this marker.

Remark: The first point and the last point are automatically linked.
