```wl
// -- Initialize DASH_Dashboard
// Adds information into the initial configuration:
// - key numbers for the last 3 months
nX = 1 ; nY = 3
FOR i = 1 TO 3
	// Adds the widget
	nIndex = DashAddWidget(MySelf, IW_Widget_KeyNumber, ...
			StringBuild("Key numbers for %1", DateToString(dDate, "Mmm YYYY")), ...
			dDate)
	// Configures the widget (placed on the left)
	DashInitialConfiguration(Myself, nIndex, nX, nY)
	// The next one will be lower
	nY++
	dDate.Month--
END
// - stock alert
// Adds the widget
nIndex = DashAddWidget(MySelf, IW_Widget_StockAlert, "Stock alert")
// Configures the widget (placed on the left) 
DashInitialConfiguration(MySelf, nIndex, 5, 1)

### Initial configuration: handling the widget by its index

`DashInitialConfiguration(<Dashboard control> , <Widget index> [, <X> [, <Y> [, <Width> [, <Height>]]]])`
---

**`<Dashboard control>: (Control name)`**

Name of the Dashboard control to be used.

**`<Widget index>: (Integer)`**

Index of the widget to use. This index corresponds to: 

- the addition number of widget defined in the window editor or in the page editor. 

- the addition number of widget returned by [DashAddWidget](../WDLang1/1000020953.md). 




**`<X>: (Optional integer)`**

Horizontal position of widget in number of cells.

If [&lt;X&gt;, &lt;Y&gt;] are not specified or if their value is equal to [0,0], the widget is positioned on the first free location. 

The first cell is cell [1, 1].

**`<Y>: (Optional integer)`**

Vertical position of widget in number of cells.

If [&lt;X&gt;, &lt;Y&gt;] are not specified or if their value is equal to [0,0], the widget is positioned on the first free location. 

The first cell is cell [1, 1].

**`<Width>: (Optional integer)`**

Width of widget in number of cells.

If [&lt;Width&gt;, &lt;Height&gt;] are not specified or if their value is equal to [0, 0]: 

- during the first call to **DashInitialConfiguration**, the widget size corresponds to the size of source internal window or page (at least 1 cell).

- during the next calls to **DashInitialConfiguration**, the widget size corresponds to the size defined during the first call.




**`<Height>: (Optional integer)`**

Height of widget in number of cells.

If [&lt;Width&gt;, &lt;Height&gt;] are not specified or if their value is equal to [0, 0]: 

- during the first call to **DashInitialConfiguration**, the widget size corresponds to the size of source internal window or page (at least 1 cell).

- during the next calls to **DashInitialConfiguration**, the widget size corresponds to the size defined during the first call.

## Remarks


- An error occurs if **DashInitialConfiguration** is called after the initialization of the Dashboard control.

- The widgets configured by **DashInitialConfiguration** will be loaded and made visible after the execution of the initialization processes.

- **DashInitialConfiguration** is ignored in the following cases: 

	- The "Remember configuration of Widgets" option is checked in the Dashboard control description window ("Details" tab) and the user makes the widget invisible. 

	- The user made the widget invisible and the configuration of the Dashboard control was saved then reloaded.
