Compresses a file. This file can be decompressed by [fUncompress](../WDLang1/3036021.md).

**Remark**: The small-size files are not likely to be compressed.

**Reminder**: Archiving functions ([zipXXX functions](../WDLang3/3082006.md)) allow to manage archives in ZIP, CAB, 7z, etc.

## Remarks




### Error codes
<a name="error_codes_ELTPARAGRAPHE000063"></a>

The following error codes are returned:

- 1: The file to compress cannot be opened.

- 2: Unable to create the compressed file. This error occurs if &lt;Path of compressed file&gt; does not exist.

- 4: The file cannot be compressed: the file is copied (the size of the file to compress is too small for instance).

- 5: Insufficient memory to perform the compression.

- 6: The compression was canceled by the user: [fStopCompress](../WDLang1/3036057.md) has been executed.

- 7: Insufficient space to create the compressed file.




The error code message can be retrieved using the [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) function with the *rrMessage* constant.

### Progress Bar

To view the progress of file compression, use [Event](../WDLang1/3015011.md) to process the <u><u><u><u>GaugeCompaction</u></u></u></u> message (1174). When this message is received, the _EVE.wParam variable contains the percentage of file compression.
