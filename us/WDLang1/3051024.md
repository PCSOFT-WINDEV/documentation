## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000143"></a>
MCI functions are used to easily handle media files. This help page presents the different operations that can be performed by the MCI functions.

To easily handle a video in WINDEV, all you have to do is use an Image control.

The following operations can be performed:

- Open and play a video in an Image control,

- Pause or stop the video,

- Control the volume.

## Opening and playing a video in an Image control

### Opening a Video file
<a name="opening_video_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000026"></a>

To open a video file, all you have to do is call [MCIOpen](../WDLang1/3051017.md). Most of the video files can be handled by the MCI functions.

Example:


```wl
// Select the video file
sFile is string
sFile = fSelect(EDT_FILE, "Select a video file...",...
	"Video files (*.avi)"+ TAB + "*.avi" + CR + ...
	"MPEG video files (*.mpg)" + TAB + "*.mpg" + CR + ...
	"Quick Time files (*.mov)" + TAB + "*.mov" + CR + ...
	"All files (*.*)" + TAB + "*.*", ...
	"*", fselOpen + fselExist)
// If a file was selected
IF sFile <> "" THEN
	 EDT_FILE = sFile
	 // Close the previous Video file if there is one
	 // No action otherwise 
	 MCIClose("MyVideo") 
	 // Open the selected Video file 
	 // "MyVideo" is the logical name (alias) chosen arbitrarily 
	 // this name will be used to handle the file thereafter 
	 // IMG_VIDEO is the Image control where the video will be displayed 
	 MCIOpen(EDT_FILE, "MyVideo", MciStyleChild, IMG_VIDEO) 
	 // If the opening failed
	 IF ErrorOccurred = True THEN
		 // Display the status report
		  Error(ErrorInfo()) 
	 END
END
```

### Playing a video file
<a name="playing_video_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000040"></a>

To play a video file, all you have to do is use [MCIPlay](../WDLang1/3051001.md).


```wl
// Play the selected video
// Reminder: "MyVideo" is the logical name chosen for this file when it is opened
MCIPlay("MyVideo")
```


**Remark**: To play the video (AVI type) in loop, use [MCIExecute](../WDLang1/3051005.md) and specify "play AVI repeat" in command line:


```wl
// Play the AVI video in loop
MCIExecute("play AVI repeat")
```

## Pausing or stopping the video

### Pausing the video
<a name="pausing_the_video_ELTPARAGRAPHE000061"></a>

To pause the video, all you have to do is call [MCIPause](../WDLang1/3051015.md).


```wl
// Pause the selected video
// Reminder: "MyVideo" is the logical name chosen for this file when it is opened
MCIPause("MyVideo")
```

<a name="NOTE3_2"></a>


### Stop
<a name="stop_ELTPARAGRAPHE000073"></a>

To stop the playback, simply use [MCIStopPlaying](../WDLang1/3051003.md).


```wl
// Stop the selected video
// Reminder: "MyVideo" is the logical name chosen for this file when it is opened
MCIStopPlaying("MyVideo")
```


**Tip**: Don't forget to reposition the video at the beginning of the file. Therefore, the video will start from the beginning the next time it is played.


```wl
// Reposition at the beginning of the file
// When the user asks to read the file again, the read operation will start from the beginning
MCIBegining("MyVideo")
```

## Controlling the volume
<a name="controlling_the_volume_ELTTEXTE000227"></a>
To control the volume, all you have to do is call [MCIVolume](../WDLang1/3051012.md). The right volume, the left volume, the treble volume and the bass volume can be turned up and down.
