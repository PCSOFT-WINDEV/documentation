Returns information about an external component. This external component corresponds to:

- an external component included in the current project.

- the current project used to define and generate an external component.

- an external component not included in the current project.




Remark: For a WINDEV/WEBDEV library (WDL file), this function is also used to know: 

- the version number. 

- the generation date.

## Remarks


### Finding out the version number of the external component
<a name="finding_out_the_version_number_the_external_component_ELTPARAGRAPHE000314"></a>

If the version of an external component loaded when starting the project is incorrect in relation to the project, a WLanguage error occurs before running the initialization code of the project.

**To test the version of an external component through programming** (*ciVersionXX* or *ciStatus* constant), the external component must be loaded when first used. The load mode of an external component is defined in the description window of the external component imported into the project ("General" tab).
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Information about a WINDEV/WEBDEV library
<a name="information_about_windevwebdev_library_ELTPARAGRAPHE000323"></a>

To find out: 

- the version number of a WINDEV/WEBDEV library (WDL file), use the following syntax: 
	
	```txt
	ComponentInfo("", ciVersion, <WDL physical name>)
	```


- the generation date of a WINDEV/WEBDEV library (WDL file), use the following syntax: 
	
	```txt
	ComponentInfo("", ciGenerationDate, <WDL physical name>)
	```




<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>




### Searching for the patch number accepted by an external component
<a name="searching_for_the_patch_number_accepted_external_component_ELTPARAGRAPHE000340"></a>

To be taken into account:

- A patch must have been created from the same project configuration as the external component.

- The patch number of a patch must be greater than or equal to the patch number of the external component.



<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>




### Searching for the patch number accepted by the WINDEV/WEBDEV elements
<a name="searching_for_the_patch_number_accepted_the_windevwebdev_elements_ELTPARAGRAPHE000351"></a>

- To find out the patch number of the first patch accepted by the application (EXE file), use the following syntax:
	
	```txt
	ComponentInfo("", ciPatchNumber, <Executable physical name>)
	```





- To find out the patch number of the first patch accepted by the library (WDL file), use the following syntax:
	
	```txt
	ComponentInfo("", ciPatchNumber, <WDL physical name>)
	```





**Remark**: [The full example](../WDLang1/1000003013025.md) of this function presents a solution for listing the patches used by an application. 

**Remark**: To be taken into account:

- A patch must have been created from the same project configuration as the executable or the library.

- The patch number of a patch must be greater than or equal to the patch number of the executable or library.



<a name="NOTE0_5"></a>




### External components sharing the context of the project
<a name="external_components_sharing_the_context_the_project_ELTPARAGRAPHE000375"></a>

The information returned by **ComponentInfo** is not available to external components that share the project context. The function returns "" (empty string).
