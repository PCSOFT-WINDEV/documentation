<a name="description"></a>
Runs the last action canceled by the end user when modifying the interface (Mode "UI modification by end user" enabled). This function is equivalent to a "Redo" (Ctrl + Y) performed by the user. 

This function is mainly used when creating an editor through programming (see "Remarks").

## Remarks


### Use conditions
<a name="use_conditions_ELTPARAGRAPHE000037"></a>

- **WinEdRedo** has no effect if no action was canceled. 

- If the last action is a custom action run by [WinEdDo](../WDLang1/1000021897.md), the procedure declared in this function is run.

- The restored action can be canceled again by pressing Ctrl + Z or through programming with [WinEdUndo](../WDLang1/1000021904.md).

### Use example
<a name="use_example_ELTPARAGRAPHE000054"></a>

[WinEdDo](../WDLang1/1000021897.md) is used to create custom actions (control creation for example) that support the undo/redo feature.

Let's take a simple example: creating a graphic object editor. 
 
A button is used to create a shape. The user must have the ability to cancel the shape creation. The following operations are performed: 

- The window switches to edit mode ([WinEdActive](../WDLang1/1000021843.md)). 

- The [WinEdDo](../WDLang1/1000021897.md) function is called. The procedure called by this function is used to create the shape. This procedure also contains the call to [WinEdDeclareUndo](../WDLang1/1000021898.md). [WinEdDeclareUndo](../WDLang1/1000021898.md) is used to define the behavior in case of user cancellation. 

- The window switches to standard mode ([WinEdActive](../WDLang1/1000021843.md)). 




The end user can cancel this action (Ctrl + Z or call to [WinEdUndo](../WDLang1/1000021904.md)) and eventually redo it (Ctrl + Y or call to [WinEdRedo](../WDLang1/1000021905.md)).
