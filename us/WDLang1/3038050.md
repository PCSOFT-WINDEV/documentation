Modifies the type and duration of the animation used when closing the application windows. This function applies to all the application windows, excluding the ones with specific settings (configured in the window editor or by [WinAnimationNext](../WDLang1/3038052.md)).

**Remark**: To configure the animation used when opening the windows, call [WinAnimationOpening](../WDLang1/3038051.md).

## Example


```wl
// Select the animation that will be used when closing the window
WinAnimationClosing(waRotationMulti, 200)
```

## Syntax

`WinAnimationClosing(<Type of animation> [, <Duration> [, <Sound>]])`
---

**`<Type of animation>: (Constant)`**

Type of animation to perform. The animation is performed in reversed direction when the windows are closed.
These types are classified by category and they can be combined (except for *waDefault* and *waRandom*).

- Proposed by WINDEV:
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *waDefault* | Default animation proposed by WINDEV. <br>This constant cannot be combined with the other constants. |
| *waNone* | No animation is proposed. |
| *waRandom* | A random animation is selected by WINDEV. <br>This constant cannot be combined with the other constants. |
| *waVista* | Windows Vista animation (combination of rotation, transparency and relocation). |



- Morphing:
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *waBook* | The plane of the window is displayed on a book that opens. |
| *waCircularFadeIn* | The window is displayed inside a disk whose size increases. |
| *waFountain* | The window appears bit by bit, as if coming out of a fountain. |
| *waInterleave* | The four corners of the window merge while inter-penetrating. |
| *waMorphCylinder* | The plane of the window is displayed on a cylinder that slowly changes into a plane. |
| *waMorphSphere* | The plane of the window is displayed on a sphere that slowly changes into a plane. |
| *waMorphWave* | The plane window is displayed on waves that fade away. |
| *waTopFilling* | The window fills from the top to the bottom. |



- Rotation:
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *waRotationMulti* | The window rotates around all axes. |
| *waRotationX* | The window quickly rotates around the X axis. |
| *waRotationY* | The window slowly rotates around the Y axis. |
| *waZigZag* | Zig zag effect. |



- Transparency:
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *waTransparent1* | The window transparency changes from 30 % to 80 %. |
| *waTransparent2* | The window transparency changes from 0% to 100%. |
| *waTransparentFixed* | The transparency remains the same (50%) during the animation. |



- Zoom:
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *waZoom* | Zoom from the click position to the final position (straight line and constant speed). |






**`<Duration>: (Optional integer or optional duration)`**

Duration of animation (in hundredths of a second). This parameter can correspond to: 

- an integer corresponding to the number of hundredths of a second,

- a Duration variable,

- the duration in a readable format (e.g., 1 s or 10 ms). 


The default duration is set to 1 second. This duration must be positive.

**`<Sound>: (Optional character string)`**

Name of WAV file that will be played during the animation.

<a name="NOTE0_1"></a>

## Remarks


- If a new window is opened during the animation, WINDEV waits for the end of animation before opening this new window.

- The animation is not applied to the system windows (windows opened by [fSelect](../WDLang1/3036053.md), [YesNo](../WDLang1/3021005.md), ...).

- [WinAnimationNext](../WDLang1/3038052.md) has priority over **WinAnimationClosing**.
