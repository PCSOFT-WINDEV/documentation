## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000165"></a>
When an application is used to display or save data in HFSQL files, this data is entered in the current language.

If the application is used in a country that uses a Latin character set, no specific configuration is required.

If the application is used in a country that uses a specific character set, this character set must also be supported by the data files. Therefore, most of the operations (searches, sorts, ...) will be performed according to the selected character set.

### Defining the character set used by a data file
<a name="defining_the_character_set_used_data_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000024"></a>

To define the character set used by a data file: 

1. Define the character set with [ChangeCharset](../WDLang1/3054001.md).

2. Create the data file with [HCreation](../WDLang4/3044255.md) (or [HCreationIfNotFound](../WDLang4/3044254.md)). In these functions, use the *hChangeCharset* constant to take into account the character set specified by [ChangeCharset](../WDLang1/3054001.md).




All the functions used to perform sorts and searches will use the specific features of the selected character set.

### Notes and limitations
<a name="notes_and_limitations_ELTPARAGRAPHE000048"></a>

- The size of string items specified in the analysis is expressed in bytes and not in characters. Depending on the character set used, you may have to increase the item size (if the characters used are coded on 2 bytes for example).

- The character set of the data file must always be identical to the character set specified by [ChangeCharset](../WDLang1/3054001.md). Otherwise, when accessing a string index (string, character, date, time):

	- Reading and seeking a record: no error will be displayed. However, the data read will not correspond to the expected data.

	- Modifying a record (addition, modification, deletion of a record or crossed record): a WLanguage error will be displayed.




- No query with joins can be performed on text items that use different character sets.

- The sort order in HFSQL indices ignores double letters (e.g., "CH" in Spanish or "LJ" in Croatian).

- ![HFSQL Client/Server](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HFCS.png) In HFSQL Client/Server, only the sort order of the following languages is supported: French, Arabic, Chinese, Korean, Estonian, Greek, Hebrew, Japanese, Polish, Russian, Thai, Turkish and Vietnamese.

### Example: Creating a data file in Hebrew
<a name="example_creating_data_file_hebrew_ELTPARAGRAPHE000067"></a>


```wl
// Language used in the application: Hebrew
Nation(nationHebrew)
// Change the character set
ChangeCharset(charsetHebrew)
// Create the data file 
// and take the change of character set into account
HCreation(Azaa, "", "", "", hChangeCharset)
// Enter a record
Azaa.toto = "סיגכניחלעכנגכךניע"
HAdd(Azaa)
```

## Changing the character set of a data file
<a name="changing_the_character_set_data_file_ELTTEXTE000231"></a>
In some cases, you may want to change the character set of a data file without re-creating this file. For example:

- a data file was translated.

- a data file is filled when installing an application with the data corresponding to the setup language.

- ...

### Modifying the character set used for the searches and for the sorts
<a name="modifying_the_character_set_used_for_the_searches_and_for_the_sorts_ELTPARAGRAPHE000085"></a>

To modify the character set used for the searches and for the sorts: 

1. Specify the character set to use with [ChangeCharset](../WDLang1/3054001.md).

2. Re-index the data file with [HIndex](../WDLang4/3044133.md). Use the *hChangeCharset* constant to use the character set specified by [ChangeCharset](../WDLang1/3054001.md).

## Finding out the character set of a data file
<a name="finding_out_the_character_set_data_file_ELTTEXTE000261"></a>


### How to?
<a name="how_ELTPARAGRAPHE000106"></a>

To identify the character set used by a data file, use the [Charset](../Proprietes/2512008.md) property on the desired HFSQL data file.

### Example: Changing the fonts according to the character set of the data file read
<a name="example_changing_the_fonts_according_the_character_set_the_data_file_read_ELTPARAGRAPHE000116"></a>


```wl
HOpen(Customer)
FileLanguage is int = Customer.Charset
// Changes the character set according to the data file format
SWITCH FileLanguage
	CASE charsetArabic: ChangeCharset(charsetArabic)
	CASE charsetDefault: ChangeCharset(charsetDefault)
	CASE charsetGreek: ChangeCharset(charsetGreek)
	CASE charsetHebrew: ChangeCharset(charsetHebrew)
	CASE charsetOccidental: ChangeCharset(charsetOccidental)
	CASE charsetRussian: ChangeCharset(charsetRussian)
	CASE charsetTurkish: ChangeCharset(charsetTurkish)
	OTHER CASE
		// Switch to western character set
	  	ChangeCharset(charsetOccidental)
END
```
