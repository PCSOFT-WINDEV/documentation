## Example


```wl
// Create an event
Event_Letsgo is ManualEvent(eventClose)

// Run a first thread

// Locks the current thread until the event is obtained
ThreadWaitSignal()
// Run a second thread
ThreadExecute("Thread2", threadNormal, "Thread_Second")

// Locks the current thread until the event is obtained
ThreadWaitSignal()

// Opens the event to run the threads
Event_Letsgo.Open()
```

```wl
PROCEDURE Thread_First()
Trace(dbgInfo(dbgProcess) + " - ThreadSendSignal(threadMain)")
ThreadSendSignal(threadMain)
Event_Letsgo.Wait()
Trace(dbgInfo(dbgProcess) + " - Event received")
```

```wl

	- **Pending threads**: All the pending threads are processed. 

	- **New threads**: If other threads arrive while the event is still open, they are processed.
