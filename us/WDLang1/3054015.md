## Remarks




### Which syntax to use? 
<a name="which_syntax_use_ELTPARAGRAPHE000097"></a>

We recommend that you use the first syntax.

To find resources whose identifiers are greater than the above-mentioned limits, you must use the first syntax.  
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>




### Managing the space characters
<a name="managing_the_space_characters_ELTPARAGRAPHE000107"></a>

The space characters entered at the end of messages are ignored. For example: "The customer: " becomes "The customer:". To force one or more space characters at the end of a message, you must use the non-breaking space character (Alt+0160, the 0 in front of 160 is mandatory).

### Displaying a message in an unavailable language
<a name="displaying_message_unavailable_language_ELTPARAGRAPHE000116"></a>

If a message was not translated for the specified language (the element is not associated with this language), the mechanism of preferred languages is used to display the requested information in another language, very close to the requested one.
