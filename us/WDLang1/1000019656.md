Loads an image in an [Image](../WDLang1/1000019650.md) variable from a memo, a file or a binary buffer (buffer containing the full data of a recognized image file).

## Example


```wl
// Load an image from a file in the executable directory
MyImage is Image
MyImage = dLoadImage("image.png")
```





```wl
sPDFFileName is string = fDataDir() + fSep() + "MyFile.pdf"
// Load a vector image (here a PDF, it could be an SVG)
// Retrieve the characteristics of the image
sPDFInfo is string = BitmapInfo(sPDFFileName)
// Vector images are transformed into bitmap images (raster, therefore not vector images)
// Define the desired image resolution
nDesiredDPI is int = 300
set nPixelWidth = Val(ExtractString(sPDFInfo,2))*nDesiredPDI / 96 
set nPixelHeight = Val(ExtractString(sPDFInfo,3))*nDesiredPDI / 96
// (Divided by 96 because it is the resolution used
// to define the size of a vector image with BitmapInfo)
// Load the image on the screen in an Image control with the size corresponding to the desired DPI
IMG_PDF = dLoadImage(sPDFFileName, imgConvert, nPixelWidth,nPixelHeight)
// Or if the image is not displayed, use an Image variable:
MyImage is Image = dLoadImage(sPDFFileName, imgConvert, nPixelWidth, nPixelHeight)

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = dLoadImage(<Image> [, <Options> [, <Width> [, <Height>]]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Image variable)`**

Name of the [Image](../WDLang1/1000019650.md) variable into which the image must be loaded. 

**`<Image>: (Character string)`**

Image to load. The image can correspond to: 

- the full path of the image file,

- the name of an image file (if the image file is located in the executable directory),

- a binary memo item in a data file, 

- a binary buffer containing the full data of a recognized image file (result of a function for saving images such as [dSaveImagePNG](../WDLang1/3029027.md)). 




**`<Options>: (Optional Integer constant)`**

Options for loading the image: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *imgConvert* | Convert an image from the 8-bit format to the 24-bit format. This option is used to apply the effect algorithms to this image for example. This constant can be used for the images corresponding to PDF files for example.<br><br>**For the vectorial images (SVG)**, this constant is mandatory. It is used to specify that the image must be converted into bitmap image (raster) before it is loaded (indeed, the [Image](../WDLang1/1000019650.md) type does not support the vectorial images).<br><br>![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) This constant is not available. |
| *imgDefault* <br>(Default value) | Load the image as it is. |



**`<Width>: (Optional integer)`**

Requested destination width (vectorial image only). This width is expressed in pixels. 

**`<Height>: (Optional integer)`**

Requested destination height (vectorial image only). This height is expressed in pixels.
