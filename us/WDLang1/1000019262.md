The **Repetition** type is used to describe and modify the characteristics of a repetition for an appointment via the different WLanguage properties. Then, the appointment will be displayed in an Organizer control or in a Scheduler control.

This type of variable is used by the [Appointment](../WDLang1/1000019244.md) type.

**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

```wl
// Defines an appointment for the morning
MyAppointment is Appointment
MyAppointment.StartDate = DateSys() + "090000"

MyAppointment.Title = "Appointment with the development team"
MyAppointment.Guest = "Jack, Mark, Sandra"
MyAppointment.Content = "Daily meeting regarding the progress of the projects."
MyAppointment.WithRepetition = True

// Configures a daily repetition of the appointment
