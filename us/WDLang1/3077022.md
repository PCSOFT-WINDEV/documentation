<a name="Use"></a>
<a name="description"></a>
Locks the current thread until it receives a signal from another thread. This function simplifies the synchronization between threads without having to implement an advanced management of events. 

Remark: This function is equivalent to [EventWait](../WDLang1/3077007.md) with an automatic event for a signal sent by [ThreadSendSignal](../WDLang1/3077021.md). Therefore, the event is automatically closed.

**Reminders**: 

- A thread is a process run in parallel with the current application (main thread). This allows you to run a task in the background (e.g. backup, etc.).

- **ThreadWaitSignal** and [ThreadSendSignal](../WDLang1/3077021.md) are used to synchronize the threads two by two.

## Example
<a class="notetitle" target="_blank" href="$DOC$=1000003077022&name=threadwaitsignal_function&product=WD">See additional examples</a>

```wl
// Create an event
EventCreate("Let's go", eventManual, eventClose)
// Run a first thread
ThreadExecute("Thread1", threadNormal, "Thread_First")
// Locks the current thread until the event is obtained
ThreadWaitSignal()

// Run a second thread
ThreadExecute("Thread2", threadNormal, "Thread_Second")
// Locks the current thread until the event is obtained
ThreadWaitSignal()

// Modifies the event to run the threads
EventChange("Let's go", eventOpen)
```

```wl
//----------------------------------------------
PROCEDURE Thread_First()
Trace(dbgInfo(dbgProcess) + " - ThreadSendSignal(threadMain)")
ThreadSendSignal(threadMain)
EventWait("Let's go")
Trace(dbgInfo(dbgProcess) + " - Event received")
```

```wl
//--------------------------------------------
PROCEDURE Thread_Second()
Trace(dbgInfo(dbgProcess) + " - ThreadSendSignal(threadMain)")
ThreadSendSignal(threadMain)
EventWait("Let's go")
Trace(dbgInfo(dbgProcess) + " - Event received")
```

## Syntax

`<Result> = ThreadWaitSignal([<Maximum timeout>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the current thread received a signal,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if the thread receives no signal (the maximum duration is exceeded).




**`<Maximum timeout>: (Optional integer, optional duration or optional constant)`**

Maximum timeout in hundredths of a second. 

- If no signal was received by the thread before the end of specified duration, &lt;Result&gt; is equal to <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>. 

- If this parameter is not specified or corresponds to the *Infinite* constant, the wait is infinite.  


This parameter can correspond to: 

- an integer corresponding to the number of hundredths of a second,

- a Duration variable,

- the duration in a readable format (e.g., 1 s or 10 ms).

## Remarks




### Endless wait
<a name="endless_wait_ELTPARAGRAPHE000123"></a>

You can end the execution of a thread even if it is locked in an endless wait for an event. Simply use [ThreadStop](../WDLang1/3077019.md).

### Synchronizing threads
<a name="synchronizing_threads_ELTPARAGRAPHE000134"></a>

**ThreadWaitSignal** and [ThreadSendSignal](../WDLang1/3077021.md) are used to synchronize the threads two by two. To synchronize several threads on the same event, the event management functions must be used:

- [EventCreate](../WDLang1/3077009.md): Creates an event.

- [EventWait](../WDLang1/3077007.md): Locks the current thread and waits for the event.

- [EventChange](../WDLang1/3077017.md): Modifies the status of an event.

- [EventDestroy](../WDLang1/3077025.md): Destroys an event.




Remark: The internal mechanisms for managing the queues and stacks allow you not to synchronize the threads ([Enqueue](../WDLang1/1000018323.md) and [Dequeue](../WDLang1/1000018322.md) for the queues, [Push](../WDLang1/1000017366.md) and [Pop](../WDLang1/1000017372.md) for the stacks).

### Miscellaneous
<a name="miscellaneous_ELTPARAGRAPHE000174"></a>

**ThreadWaitSignal** can be used in a process linked to a control (click code of a button, for example): in this case, it is used in the main thread.
