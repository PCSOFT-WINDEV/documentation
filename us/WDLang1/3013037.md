## Remarks




### Random pool
<a name="random_pool_ELTPARAGRAPHE000089"></a>

The "pool" from which the random number is "chosen" can be initialized by [InitRandom](../WDLang1/3013030.md).

If [InitRandom](../WDLang1/3013030.md) is not called, the random values generated by **Random** will be the same for each program execution.
