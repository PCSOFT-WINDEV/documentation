Reads the content of an INI file (or the content of a file structured like .INI files). You can get:

- the value of a keyword found in a specific section,

- the list of keywords found in a section,

- the list of file sections.




Example of .INI file


```txt
[WD examples]
Name1 = WDInstall
Name2 = WDBench
[Description of WDInstall]
Caption = Use the control panel of Windows
LST = 43
Page = 12
```

```wl
// Default choice read in the .INI

## Syntax

`<Result> = INIRead(<Section> [, <Keyword> [, <Not found> [, <File>]]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Character string)`**



- Text sought or list of keywords found in the section (the keywords are separated by CR characters), 

- List of file sections (the sections are separated by CR characters).

- Content of &lt;Not found&gt; in the following cases:

	- the string corresponding to the keyword is empty,

	- the keyword is not found,

	- the file is not found.




- Empty string (if &lt;Not found&gt; is not specified or if it is equal to an empty string) in the following cases:

	- the string corresponding to the keyword is empty,

	- the keyword is not found,

	- the file is not found.







**`<Section>: (Character string)`**

Name of section to read in the INI file. 
If this parameter and &lt;Keyword&gt; correspond to an empty string, &lt;Result&gt; contains the list of sections found in the file, separated by CR characters.

**Remark**: This name cannot contain the "-" character.


**`<Keyword>: (Optional character string)`**

Name of the keyword containing the information to read. 
If this parameter is an empty string, &lt;Result&gt; contains the list of keywords found in &lt;Section&gt;, separated by CR characters.


**`<Not found>: (Optional character string or optional integer)`**

Text or integer to be returned if the requested keyword has not been read. This parameter corresponds to an empty string by default.
![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png)![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This parameter can only be a string. 

**`<File>: (Optional character string)`**

Full name of file to read (with its extension). 

- The WIN.INI file will be used if this parameter is not specified. 

- If only the name of the file is specified, the specified file will be sought in the directory of Windows.




![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Full name of file to read (with its extension). 

- If this parameter is not specified, the file used will be the one named like the project and found in the runtime directory of application. 

- The file will be created if it does not exist. 

- If only the path is not specified , the file will be sought in the runtime directory of application.


![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) Full name of file to read (with its extension). The **.PCS.conf** file will be used if this parameter is not specified (this file must be found in the base directory of the user). If only the path is not specified , the file will be sought in the home directory of the user.

## Remarks


### Reading the persistent values
<a name="reading_the_persistent_values_ELTPARAGRAPHE000159"></a>

To read the persistent values in a INI file (saved with [SaveParameter](../WDLang1/3025046.md)), use [LoadParameter](../WDLang1/3025047.md).
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Miscellaneous
<a name="miscellaneous_ELTPARAGRAPHE000172"></a>

- To read in the registry, use the functions specific to the registry: [RegistryQueryValue](../WDLang1/3065012.md), ...

- INI files are limited to 64 KB.

- **TSE**: Bu default, **INIRead** uses the Windows directory.
	Caution: Until version 21, **INIRead** used the user's Windows directory by default.
	Reminder: In TSE mode, the access to a '.INI' file with a relative name is not recommended. We advise you to use one of the following solutions: 

	- [SaveParameter](../WDLang1/3025046.md) and [LoadParameter](../WDLang1/3025047.md). 

	- Registry,

	- using an absolute name, based on [fDataDir](../WDLang1/3036001.md) for example.

### Windows Vista (and later)
<a name="windows_vista_and_later_ELTPARAGRAPHE000214"></a>

The programming standards of Windows do not advise you to write:

- into the WIN.INI file, 

- into the system directories (Windows directory, "Program Files" directory, ...).




**In Windows Vista (and later) with the UAC mechanism enabled**, the administrator privileges are required to perform these operations. If the application does not have the required administrator privileges, the [UAC mechanism](../Editeurs/2025014.md) will redirect the files (called virtualization) to a directory specific to the user who uses the application (C:\\Users\\&lt;LOGIN&gt;AppData\\Local\\VirtualStore\\Windows\\). Files can be read again with **INIRead**, used in the same application. This virtualization mechanism of files is proposed by Windows Vista (and later) for compatibility and it is not available in 64 bits.

**Caution**: If the INI file is automatically virtualized by Windows Vista (and later), the INI file cannot be shared between several applications (especially if these applications use different privileges).

**Programming tip**: To create a INI file without having the administrator privileges: 

- do not use the WIN.INI file (the &lt;File&gt; parameter must be specified)

- avoid writing to the Windows directory or to the "Program Files" directory, 

- use the system directory of the application (returned by [SysDir](../WDLang1/3073026.md) with the *srAppDataCommun* constant, for example).
