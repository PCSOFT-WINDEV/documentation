<a name="principle_for_developing_multilingual_application_ELTTEXTE000103"></a>
The main steps for developing a multilingual application are as follows: 

1. [Choosing the languages supported by the project and the analysis.](../WDLang1/3054010.md)

2. [Translating the project elements (window, code messages, ...) into the different languages of the project.](../WDLang1/3054009.md)

3. [Defining the project language through programming](../WDLang1/3054012.md).

4. [Managing specific character sets in the data files](../WDLang1/3054017.md).

5. [Creating the executable and the setup program](../WDLang1/3054006.md).
