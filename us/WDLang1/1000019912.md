`<Result> = dCopyWindowImage(<Window> [, <Shadow management>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Image or Binary Buffer variable)`**



- Name of the variable of type [Image](../WDLang1/1000019650.md) that will contain the screenshot.

- Binary buffer corresponding to the image. This buffer can be directly assigned to an Image control. 




**`<Window>: (Character string)`**

Name of WINDEV or WINDEV Mobile window whose image will be copied. If this parameter corresponds an empty string (""), the current window will be copied. 

**`<Shadow management>: (Integer constant)`**

Shadow mode for window borders (Windows 10 mainly):

## Remarks


- The window to copy must be displayed on the screen. 

- If the window is clipped, the entire area corresponding to the window is copied: therefore, the elements that appear in background of the clipped window are also copied. 

- Caution: If the "Allow window screenshot" option ("Details" tab of the description window) is not checked, the window image will be entirely blacked out. This option can be modified in the code using the [ScreenshotAllowed](../Proprietes/1000025336.md) property.
