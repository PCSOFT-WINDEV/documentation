Displays a non-blocking message in a standard dialog box with the answers "Yes", "No", "Cancel" and calls a WLanguage procedure with the user's response. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=fonctions_dialogue%20-%20HC%20N%B0005.gif)


Remarks: 

- **This is a non-blocking dialog box**. The WLanguage code that follows the call to **ConfirmAsynchronous** continues to run. To close the window, the user must validate one of the buttons. When the user clicks one of the buttons, the code of a WLanguage procedure is run.

- In the WLanguage code following the call to the function, another modal window cannot be opened before closing the dialog box. 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) WINDEV allows you to apply the skin template of your project to this dialog box. For more details, see [Customizing dialog boxes](../WDLang1/3021003.md).

## Remarks


### Features of the dialog box
<a name="features_the_dialog_box_ELTPARAGRAPHE000081"></a>

- The message is aligned to the left.

- The text of the buttons changes according to the language used by Windows at runtime (or used by the browser, in the case of a WEBDEV site).

- The maximum number of characters cannot exceed 4096. If a larger string is passed as parameter, it will be truncated.

- The icon displayed (exclamation mark in a WINDEV application, question mark in a WEBDEV application) cannot be modified.




- The title of the dialog box corresponds to the title of the current window (or page).
	

- To modify or define the title of dialog box, use [NextTitle](../WDLang1/3038043.md).




![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) **To customize this dialog box** (and all the system dialog boxes in your application), check "Customize system windows (Info, YesNo, Confirm, Dialog)" in the "Style" tab of the project description. For more details, see [Customizing dialog boxes](../WDLang1/3021003.md).

### Line break in the dialog box
<a name="line_break_the_dialog_box_ELTPARAGRAPHE000095"></a>

The CR string (Carriage Return) can be used to force a break to the next line. For example: 

```wl
ConfirmAsynchronous("The XXX form was modified." + CR + ...
	"Do you want to save it before closing?", Procedure_ConfirmAsynchronous)
```


You also have the ability to use the syntax of multiline strings. For example: 

```wl
ConfirmAsynchronous(
[
The XXX form has been modified.

Do you want to save changes before closing?
], Procedure_ConfirmAsynchronous)
```

- Timers ([TimerSys](../WDLang1/3015006.md)) are not stopped when this function is called.

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Windows events are not stopped when this function is called.

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) [DelayBeforeClosing](../WDLang1/3038040.md) limits how long the message is displayed. The dialog box is automatically closed. For question or confirmation dialog boxes, the default button corresponds to the expected answer.
