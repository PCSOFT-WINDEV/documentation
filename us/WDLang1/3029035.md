## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000272"></a>
WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile include several functions for displaying, drawing, copying and saving the drawings and images from your applications or sites.

WINDEV, WEBDEV et WINDEV Mobile propose functions used to:

- draw several drawings, 

- display any type of image, 

- copy the drawings and the images, 

- save drawings and images.

### Using the drawing functions in Linux
<a name="using_the_drawing_functions_linux_ELTPARAGRAPHE000083"></a>

To use the drawing function in Linux, the QT library (Core and GUI) version 5 (or later) must be installed. 

**In Ubuntu**, this library can be installed with the following commands: 


```txt
sudo apt-get install libqtcore5
sudo apt-get install libqtgui5
```


**In mandriva 2010 Spring**, this library can be installed with the following commands: 


```txt
urpmi libqtgui5
```

### Drawing in an Image control
<a name="drawing_image_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000113"></a>

To draw in an Image control: 

1. Initialize the drawing in the Image control ([dStartDrawing](../WDLang1/3029009.md)). This initialization is used to allocate a specific memory area for the management of drawings.

2. Draw with the [drawing functions](../WDLang1/3029033.md).

3. If necessary, insert text in your drawings with [dText](../WDLang1/3029032.md).

4. Zoom and copy images as required with [dCopyImage](../WDLang1/3029007.md).

5. If necessary, save the drawing using the save functions ([dSaveImageBMP](../WDLang1/3029026.md), [dSaveImageGIF](../WDLang1/3029040.md), [dSaveImageJPEG](../WDLang1/3029038.md), [dSaveImagePNG](../WDLang1/3029027.md)).

6. If necessary, print the file using [iPrintImage](../WDLang5/3046017.md).

7. If necessary, destroy the drawing in memory with [dEndDrawing](../WDLang1/3029019.md).





### Drawing in an Image variable
<a name="drawing_image_variable_ELTPARAGRAPHE000162"></a>

To draw in an Image variable, some rules must be complied with:

1. Declare a variable of type [Image](../WDLang1/1000019650.md). 

2. Initialize the drawing in the variable ([dStartDrawing](../WDLang1/3029009.md)). This initialization is used to allocate a specific memory area for the management of drawings.

3. Draw with the [drawing functions](../WDLang1/3029033.md).

4. If necessary, insert text in your drawings with [dText](../WDLang1/3029032.md).

5. If necessary, save the drawing using the save functions ([dSaveImageBMP](../WDLang1/3029026.md), [dSaveImageGIF](../WDLang1/3029040.md), [dSaveImageJPEG](../WDLang1/3029038.md), [dSaveImagePNG](../WDLang1/3029027.md)).

6. If necessary, print the file using [iPrintImage](../WDLang5/3046017.md).

7. If necessary, destroy the drawing in memory with [dEndDrawing](../WDLang1/3029019.md).
