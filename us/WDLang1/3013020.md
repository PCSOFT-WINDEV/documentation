Loads a library of WINDEV objects in memory (.WDL). This function is used to:

- use custom libraries for each user. This allows you to create several libraries and to install one of these libraries according to the user.

- divide a "large" library into several "smaller' libraries, loaded upon request.




This library will be loaded in memory until:

- the application ends,

- [UnloadWDL](../WDLang1/3013013.md) is run.
