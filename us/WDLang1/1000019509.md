Extracts a resource from the application into a physical device location.

**Remarks**: 

- ![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) The resource to extract must have been included in the generated application by the generation wizard (see Notes). 

- ![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png)![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) In WINDEV applications or WEBDEV sites, the resource to extract must be: 

	- in the "Other" category of the [Project explorer](../Editeurs/2027029.md) pane,

	- in the main library of the application (WDL file). 







Caution: To prevent piracy, WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile elements (reports, windows, etc.) cannot be extracted at runtime.

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = fExtractResource(<Resource name> [, <Destination>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the resource was extracted,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. If an error occurs, the [ErrorOccurred](../WDLang1/3087001.md) variable is set to <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md).




**`<Resource name>: (Character string)`**

Name of resource to extract (file name with its extension).



![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png)![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) The resource to extract must be found in the main application library (WDL file). The library must have not been loaded by [LoadWDL](../WDLang1/3013020.md).

**`<Destination>: (Optional character string)`**





![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png)![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) Full path of destination file. 
If the directory exists, the resource is directly extracted into this directory.
The directory is created if it does not exist. 
If this parameter is not specified or if it corresponds to an empty string (""), the resource will be extracted into the application data directory (returned by [fDataDir](../WDLang1/3036001.md)) in a file named like the resource.
The destination file will be overwritten if it already exists before the extraction.

### Generation wizard
<a name="generation_wizard_ELTPARAGRAPHE000181"></a>

The wizard for generating Android, Universal Windows 10 app or iPhone/iPad applications allows you to specify whether files and libraries must be included in the application. 

In an Android application, you have the ability to include: 

- specific resources. 

- specific Java archives. 




Then, these files can be: 

- used directly (files that will only be read, for example: sound files, image files, etc.). 

- extracted with **fExtractResource** (e.g., files that will be modified by the application)




If an image is included in the application, it can be directly assigned to a control by specifying its name. For example: 


```wl
IMG_Image = image1
```

### Special case: ".WDD" file (analysis description)
<a name="special_case_wdd_file_analysis_description_ELTPARAGRAPHE000255"></a>

An analysis description (".WDD" file) integrated to the library of an application cannot be extracted. 

To extract a file from a library that cannot be extracted by **fExtractResource**, you can use an HFSQL data file integrated in the library.
