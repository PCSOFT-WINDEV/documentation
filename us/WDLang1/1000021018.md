Opens a window in a mobile application. 

Remarks: 

- This function replaces [OpenChild](../WDLang1/3038021.md) used to open windows in a mobile application. Only the mobile feature will be presented in this documentation page. For more details, see [OpenChild](../WDLang1/3038021.md).  

- **OpenMobileWindow** can be used in all IDEs to allow for cross-platform code. Functions or procedures that use **OpenMobileWindow** can be shared between several products without generating any compilation error.






![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png)![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) This function is available only to simplify the Webification of WINDEV/WINDEV Mobile projects. In a WEBDEV site, this function has the same behavior as [PageDisplay](../WDLang2/3058008.md).

## Remarks


### Parameters passed to the window to open
<a name="parameters_passed_the_window_open_ELTPARAGRAPHE000108"></a>The parameters are retrieved in the event "Global declarations" associated with  the window. The first line of code of this event must correspond to the following line:


```txt
PROCEDURE <Window> (<Parameter 1> [, ... [, <Parameter N>]])
```
where: 

- &lt;Window &gt; must correspond to the name of the window. 

- &lt;Parameter N&gt; must correspond to the parameters expected. **Caution: These parameters are passed by value and not by reference.**




For more details, see [Window with parameters](../WDChamp/1010026.md).


<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Window opening mode
<a name="window_opening_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000137"></a>

The window is opened in non-modal mode:

- the opened window becomes the current window.

- after the window opening, the processes following the call to **OpenMobileWindow** in the parent window are run.

- the user will have the ability to click one of the parent windows of opened window.

### Limitations
<a name="limitations_ELTPARAGRAPHE000156"></a>

- **OpenMobileWindow** must not be called in the event "Initializing" associated with the project.

- ![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) **OpenMobileWindow** must not be called in the event "Closing" of a child window.



<a name="NOTE0_6"></a>


### Closing a window
<a name="closing_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000172"></a>

A window opened with **OpenMobileWindow** can be closed with [Close](../WDLang1/3038018.md) (without parameters) from any event associated with the window or a control in the window.
<a name="NOTE0_7"></a>


### Title of the window to be opened
<a name="title_the_window_opened_ELTPARAGRAPHE000186"></a>

By default, the window title is the one defined in the editor (in the "General" tab of the description window).

To modify the window title, use [NextTitle](../WDLang1/3038043.md) or [CurrentTitle](../WDLang1/3038023.md).
