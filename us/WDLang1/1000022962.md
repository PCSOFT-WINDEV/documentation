When called from the "Request for refreshing the display" event of a supercontrol, a control template, an internal window or an internal page, the function immediately executes the "Request for refreshing the display" event of the higher level. (This usually means the window, but it can also be a supercontrol, control template, internal window or internal page).

If the function is called several times during an event, the refresh event will be run several times.

**Remark**: This function is mainly used: 

- when refreshing the interface via threads.

### "Request for refreshing the display" event
<a name="request_for_refreshing_the_display_event_ELTPARAGRAPHE000061"></a>

One of the events associated with the windows, internal windows, pages, page templates, control templates and supercontrols is "Request for refreshing the display". This event is used to group the code for refreshing the controls: content of controls, state (visible, grayed, etc.), caption to refresh, etc.

This event can receive parameters. Simply declare a procedure in the process. For example: 


```wl
// Request for refreshing the display
PROCEDURE AskForRefresh(RefreshType is Boolean)
```


This event is run upon request by the following functions:

- [RequestUpdateUI](../WDLang1/1000021378.md): Executes the "Request for refreshing the display" event at the end of the current process (asynchronous execution).

- [ExecuteRefreshUI](../WDLang1/1000021379.md): Immediately executes the "Request for refreshing the display" event. 

- [RequestUpdateUIParent](../WDLang1/1000022961.md): Executes the "Request for refreshing the display" event of the higher level at the end of the current process (asynchronous execution).

- **ExecuteUpdateUIParent**: Immediately executes the "Request for refreshing the display" event of the higher level.


When these functions are called, you can specify the value of the parameters expected by the event. 

Remark: The "Request for refreshing the display" event can also be immediately run by [ExecuteProcess](../WDLang1/3013031.md) with the following syntax: 


```txt
ExecuteProcess(<Element name>, trtRequestRefresh)
```
