Checks a character string before and after transmission between WINDEV applications and WEBDEVsites.

This function is used to check whether a character string was properly transmitted between WINDEV applications and WEBDEV sites during transmissions with risk of information loss (modem for example). To do so, calculate the "Crc16" value before transmitting the string and check its value when receiving the string: the two values must be identical.

## Example


```wl
nCrcRead is int	// Control character read
LineRead is string	// String read
...
IF nCrcRead <> sComputeCrc16(LineRead) THEN
	Info("Error while retrieving the string")
END
```

## Remarks
![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This function can return a different result in the WINDEV version. To improve the reusability to the code, we recommend that you use [sComputeCrc32](../WDLang1/3062015.md).
