In previous versions, this property returns an empty string. |
| DateLastAccessed | DateTime | Date and time the file was last accessed.<br><br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This property is available from Android 8 only. In previous versions, this property returns an empty string in read mode, and has no effect in write mode. |
