<a name="description"></a>
Lists the files found in a directory and returns the list of files. The listed files are sought from the given directory. 

**Other use**: For each file found, **fListFile** can automatically call a specific procedure written in WLanguage. This procedure is used to handle the current file. In this case, **fListFile** returns the number of listed files.

**Remark**: In 64-bit Windows, the access to a system directory from a 32-bit executable can be performed in a directory that differs from the expected one. For more details, see [Native 64-bit and native 32-bit](../Editeurs/2030048.md).

## Syntax

### Listing the files found in a directory

`<Result> = fListFile(<Path and generic name of files> , <Options>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Character string)`**

Full name of listed files, separated by CR characters (Carriage Return).

**Caution**: The function returns the files with short or long names that match the filter.

**`<Path and generic name of files>: (Character string)`**

Path and generic name of files to list. Generic characters (\* and?) are allowed. Special cases:

- ***if the directory and the drive are not specified***: the search path is built from the current drive and from the current directory for this drive.

- ***if the drive is not specified while the directory is specified***: the search path is built from the current drive and from the directory passed as parameter.

- ***if the drive is specified while the directory is not specified***, the search path is built from the specified drive and from the current directory for this drive.




![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png)![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) This parameter can be in Ansi or Unicode format.







**`<Options>: (Combination of Integer constants)`**

Option used to define the information returned as well as the type of iteration performed for the directory files:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *fdFullInformation* | Each line (separated by carriage return - CR) contains the following information:<br><br><pre><code><Full file name> + TAB + <Size in bytes> + TAB + <br><Date of last modification> + TAB + <File attributes></code></pre><br>The date is in YYYYMMDDHHmmSS format. The attributes are identical to the ones returned by [fAttribute](../WDLang1/3036010.md). |
| *fdInterruptible* | The iteration can be interrupted by pressing ESC. The function will return the name of the listed files until the interruption. |
| *fPathUNICODE* | &lt;Result&gt; will be a string in Unicode format.  |
| *frNoHiddenDirectory* | If the *frFullInformation* constant is used, the hidden directories are not listed (attribute = "H"). |
| *frNoHiddenFile* | If the *frFullInformation* constant is used, the hidden files are not listed (attribute = "H"). |
| *frNotRecursive* | The iteration is non-recursive. Subdirectories are ignored. |
| *frRecursive*<br>(Default value) | The iteration is recursive. Subdirectories are automatically taken into account. |

### Listing the files found in a directory by calling a procedure for each file

`<Result> = fListFile(<Path and generic name of files> , <WLanguage procedure> [, <Pointer> [, <Options>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**

Number of listed files.

**`<Path and generic name of files>: (Character string)`**

Path and generic name of files to list. Generic characters (\* and?) are allowed. Special cases:

- ***if the directory and the drive are not specified***: the search path is built from the current drive and from the current directory for this drive.

- ***if the drive is not specified while the directory is specified***: the search path is built from the current drive and from the directory passed as parameter.

- ***if the drive is specified while the directory is not specified***, the search path is built from the specified drive and from the current directory for this drive.










**`<WLanguage procedure>: (Procedure name)`**

Name of the WLanguage procedure ("callback") called for each listed file. This procedure is used to handle the current file. For more details on this procedure, see [Parameters of the procedure used by fListFile](../WDLang1/1000024673.md). 



**`<Pointer>: (Optional integer)`**

Pointer passed to &lt;WLanguage procedure&gt;.



**`<Options>: (Optional Integer constant (or combination of constants))`**

Type of iteration performed for the directory files:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *fdInterruptible* | The iteration can be interrupted by pressing ESC.<br><br><br>![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) This constant has no effect. |
| *fPathUNICODE* | &lt;Result&gt; will be a string in Unicode format. |
| *frNotRecursive* | The iteration is non-recursive. Subdirectories are ignored. |
| *frRecursive*<br>(Default value) | The iteration is recursive. Subdirectories are automatically taken into account. |

## Remarks


### Handling errors
<a name="handling_errors_ELTPARAGRAPHE000251"></a>

**Caution**: **fListFile** returns no error code. To determine if this function has generated an error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) with the *errMessage* constant.
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png)![User code (UMC)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/MCU.png) 

### Listing the subdirectories of a directory
<a name="listing_the_subdirectories_directory_ELTPARAGRAPHE000265"></a>

To list the subdirectories of a directory, use [fListDirectory](../WDLang1/3036062.md).

**Tip**: **fListFile** can also be used to list the subdirectories of a directory.
Example:


```wl
fListFile("c:\temp\anim\.", proc) 
// Don't forget the '.' at the end of string to identify the directories
```



```wl
PROCEDURE proc(Dir, file, nChange, ptr) 
Trace(Dir)
```
