Converts a duration in character string format to a duration that can be used by a [Duration](../Motscles/1514069.md) variable.

**Remark**: This function is mainly used to assign the result of [DateTimeDifference](../WDLang1/3027020.md) to a Duration variable.

## Example


```wl
// To fill a duration from the result of DateTimeDifference
sDiff is string 
sDiff = DateTimeDifference(sStart, sEnd)
// Convert the difference to a Duration variable
dDuration is Duration 
dDuration = StringToDuration(sDiff, durationCenti)
```



```wl
sMyString is string = "The duration is 3 days, 13 hours, 45 minutes." 
dDuration is Duration 
dDuration = StringToDuration(sMyString, "The duration is D days, HH hours, MM minutes.")
Trace(dDuration)
```

## Syntax

`<Result> = StringToDuration(<String> , <Format>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Duration variable)`**

Duration in a format recognized by the Duration variables.

**`<String>: (Character string)`**

Duration in the format specified in &lt;Format>.

**`<Format>: (Character string)`**

Format of the duration to convert. This format corresponds to:

- a character string (a sentence for example). The characters that represent the different elements of the duration (D, HH, MM, SS or CCC) will be automatically replaced with the value in the &lt;String&gt; parameter. In this string:

	- D represents the number of days, 

	- HH represents the number of hours,

	- MM represents the number of minutes,

	- SS represents the number of seconds,

	- CCC represents the number of milliseconds.




- one of the following constants:
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *durationCenti* | Format used: "+DHHMMSSCC": used to create a duration from the format of the result of [DateTimeDifference](../WDLang1/3027020.md) |
| *durationMilli* | Format used: "+DHHMMSSCCC" |

## Remarks
The direct assignment &lt;Duration variable&gt; = &lt;String&gt; is equivalent to using **StringToDuration** with the "+DHHMMSSCCC" format.
