## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000369"></a>
To use the telemetry in a WINDEV or WINDEV Mobile application, you must: 

1. [Enable the telemetry in the application](#NOTE2_1). This activation can be done: 

	- in the project description. In this case, this activation is performed for all the existing project configurations. 

	- in the platform description. 

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) when creating the executable. 




2. Deploy the application: 

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) [Create the setup program for the application](#NOTE3_1).

	- Install the application.   







Remark: The telemetry data is anonymous data by default. You have the ability to identify the user by using [TelemetryIdentifyUser](../WDLang1/1000022160.md).

## Enabling the telemetry
<a name="enabling_the_telemetry_ELTTEXTE000393"></a>
The telemetry can be enabled: 

- in the project description. In this case, this activation is performed for all the existing project configurations. 

- in the platform description. 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) when creating the executable. 





### Enabling the telemetry in the project description
<a name="enabling_the_telemetry_the_project_description_ELTPARAGRAPHE000070"></a>

To enable the telemetry in the project description: 

1. Open the project description window: on the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, click "Description".

2. In the window that is displayed, select the "Telemetry" tab. 

3. Check "Enable the telemetry for the project" and specify the requested parameters: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=T%E9l%E9m%E9trie_Projet%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif&type=thumb)


	- Server location: 

	- Local, network or Internet network: In this case, you have the ability to specify the protocol used: HTPP or HTTPS. 
						Remark: For an HTTPS protocol, a certificate must be installed on your Web server (IIS or Apache).

	- CLOUD platform. In this case, all you have to do is specify the CLOUD account to use. 
						Remark: A Telemetry platform is required. 

4. Validate. 




These parameters are defined for the current project and for all its configurations. The telemetry can be customized or disabled for each project configuration. 


### Enabling the telemetry in the description of a configuration
<a name="enabling_the_telemetry_the_description_configuration_ELTPARAGRAPHE000119"></a>

To configure the telemetry for the current configuration: 

1. On the "Project" tab, in the "Project configuration" group, click "Current configuration". 

2. Select the "Telemetry" tab to configure the telemetry. 

3. Several options are available: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=telemetrie%20-%20Options%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif&type=thumb)


	- **Use the project telemetry parameters**: This option allows you to use the telemetry parameters specified in the project description. 
			 Caution: If the telemetry is not enabled in the project, the current configuration will not use the telemetry. 

- **Use specific telemetry parameters**: This option is used to define specific telemetry parameters for the current configuration. You can for example disable the telemetry on the project and enable it on a configuration only. You also have the ability to use specific parameters for a type of configuration (for example, the Windows and mobile configurations do not use the same server). 

- **Disable the telemetry for this configuration**: This option allows you to disable the telemetry for the current configuration. 




Remark: If you select "Use specific telemetry parameters", all the telemetry parameters must be defined.  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=telemetrie%20-%20Options%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif&type=thumb)


1. Specify the location of telemetry server: 

	- Local, network or Internet network: In this case, you have the ability to specify the protocol used: HTPP or HTTPS. 
			Remark: For an HTTPS protocol, a certificate must be installed on your Web server (IIS or Apache).

	- CLOUD platform. In this case, all you have to do is specify the CLOUD account to use. 




2. Specify the address of the telemetry server to use: 

	- Server address,

	- Username and associated password. This data was given at the end of [setup of telemetry server](../WDLang1/1410086581.md). 




3. Check the connection to the telemetry server to make sure that the data is correct. 

4. The option "Telemetry of the application" is used to configure: 

	- The application name. This name will be proposed in the telemetry dashboard. 

	- The mode for triggering the collection of information. The data collection is automatically enabled by default but it can be enabled through programming with [TelemetryEnable](../WDLang1/1000021900.md).

### Enabling the telemetry when creating the executable
<a name="enabling_the_telemetry_when_creating_the_executable_ELTPARAGRAPHE000176"></a>

When creating a Windows executable, you have the ability to enable and configure the telemetry. 

The different steps are as follows: 

1. Select (if necessary) the configuration corresponding to the executable. 

2. Create the executable: on the "Project" tab, in the "Generation" group, click "Generate".

3. In the different steps regarding the "EXE definition", the "Telemetry" step is used to specity the telemetry options. 

4. Several options are available: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=telemetrie%20-%20Exe%20-%20HC%20N%B0004.gif)


	- **Use the project telemetry parameters**: This option allows you to use the telemetry parameters specified in the project description. This option cannot be used if the telemetry is not enabled in the project. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=telemetrie%20-%20Exe%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)




Follow the different wizard steps to create your executable.  

**Remark**: The telemetry data sent to the server is processed every two hours. Therefore, it will not be immediately visible in the telemetry dashboard.

## Installing the application

### Installing an application that support the telemetry
<a name="installing_application_that_support_the_telemetry_ELTPARAGRAPHE000234"></a>

The procedure for creating the setup of an application that supports the telemetry is identical to the procedure for creating a standard setup, with an additional step. 

1. Start the setup procedure of the application: on the "Project" tab, in the "Generation" group, click "Setup procedure".

2. Create the executable if necessary. 

3. In the left section of the wizard, select "Skin template of installer". 

4. Follow the different wizard steps until you reach the "Enabling the telemetry" step. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Tel%E9m%E9trie%20-%20Installation%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif&type=thumb)
In this screen, you can: 

	- **Display an information message to the user during the setup**. This information message informs the end user that the telemetry will be used on his application. 
			 **Important note**: Regardless this message is displayed or not, the telemetry will be enabled in the application. 
			If [TelemetryIdentifyUser](../WDLang1/1000022160.md) was used in the application code, the default message does not specify that the transmitted data is anonymous data. 

	- **Allow the user to disable the telemetry during the setup**. 
			In this case, the end user can check (or not) the option "I accept to contribute to the improvement of XXXX". No data will be collected if the end user refuses. 
			Remark: If the option "During an update, the telemetry will be automatically proposed to the user even if it was disabled" is checked, the question will be asked to the end user whenever a new update is performed.







Then, the procedure for setup creation is the standard one. 

**Reminder**: This setup program is supplied in English and in French. To translate the setup program into other languages, a setup custom program must be created. 

When the application is installed, the data is sent to the server:  

- every hour. This frequency can be modified by [TelemetryConfigure](../WDLang1/1000021913.md). 

- when closing the application.
