## Example


```wl
// Copy a directory
Res = fCopyDir("C:\Directory\MyFiles", "D:\Documents\FileCopy", FilterFile)
```

```wl
PROCEDURE FilterFile(sSourcePath, sDestinationPath, flChange, nCustomParameter)

// Don't copy the temporary files
IF fExtractPath(sSourcePath, fExtension) ~= ".tmp"
	RESULT fcIgnore
ELSE
	RESULT fcCopy
END
```

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = fCopyDir_Callback(<File to copy> , <Destination file> [, <Change> [, <Procedure pointer>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer constant)`**

Copy of the current element: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *fcCopy* | Used to continue the copy. |
| *fcIgnore* | Used to ignore the copy of a file. |
| *fcStop* | Used to stop the copy permanently. |



**`<File to copy>: (Character string)`**

Path and name of the file to copy. 

**`<Destination file>: (Character string)`**

Path and name of the destination file. 

**`<Change>: (Optional integer constant)`**

Used to know if there was a directory change. The possible values are: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *flChangeDir* | The file is the first one listed in a subdirectory of &lt;File to copy&gt; (this means that the directory has been changed). |
| *flFile* | All other cases. |
| *flFirstFile* | The file is the first one listed in the directory of &lt;File to copy&gt;. |



**`<Procedure pointer>: (Optional integer)`**

Value passed in the &lt;Pointer&gt; of [fCopyDir](../WDLang1/3036041.md). If &lt;Pointer&gt; is not specified in [fCopyDir](../WDLang1/3036041.md), &lt;Procedure pointer&gt; is set to 0.

To get the value of &lt;Procedure pointer&gt;, its value must be assigned to the value of &lt;Pointer&gt; in the procedure with [Transfer](../WDLang1/3014015.md).

## Remarks


### Example of values that can be taken by &lt;Change&gt;
<a name="example_values_that_can_taken_ELTPARAGRAPHE000081"></a>

The following are the different values that can be taken by &lt;Change&gt; when browsing the files copied by [fCopyDir](../WDLang1/3036041.md): 


| Current file | &lt;Change&gt; |
| --- | --- |
| Dir\\File 1 | *flFirstFile* |
| Dir\\File n | *flFile* |
| Dir\\SubDir 1\\File 1 | *flChangeDir* |
| Dir\\SubDir 1\\File m | *flFile* |
| Dir\\SubDir 2\\File 1 | *flChangeDir* |
| Dir\\SubDir 2\\File x | *flFile* |

### Values returned by the procedure
<a name="values_returned_the_procedure_ELTPARAGRAPHE000123"></a>

The procedure called by [fCopyDir](../WDLang1/3036041.md) must return one of the following values: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *fcCopy* | Used to continue the copy. |
| *fcIgnore* | Used to ignore the copy of a file. |
| *fcStop* | Used to stop the copy permanently. |


A WLanguage error occurs if the procedure does not return one of these values. 

**Case 1. Full interruption of copy** 

To force the interruption of the copy, the procedure called by [fCopyDir](../WDLang1/3036041.md) must return the *fcStop* constant.

Example: the "CopyProduct" procedure is automatically called by [fCopyDir](../WDLang1/3036041.md):


```wl
PROCEDURE CopyProduct(PathSourceFile, PathDestinationFile)
...
// Stop requested?
Multitask(-1)
IF KeyPressed(kpEscape) = True THEN
	Info("The copy will be stopped")
	RESULT fcStop
END
...
RESULT fcCopy
```

If the Esc key is pressed, the procedure called by [fCopyDir](../WDLang1/3036041.md) returns the *fcStop* constant.

In any other case (to continue copying), the procedure called by [fCopyDir](../WDLang1/3036041.md) returns the *fcCopy* constant.

**Case 2.  Partial interruption of copy** 

To prevent the procedure called by [fCopyFile](../WDLang1/3036004.md) from being run for a given file, this procedure must return the *fcIgnore* constant. 

Example: The "FindProduct" procedure is automatically called by [fCopyDir](../WDLang1/3036041.md):

```wl
PROCEDURE FindProduct(PathSourceFile, PathDestinationFile)
...
// File to ignore
IF StringEndsWith(PathSourceFile, "WrongFile.XLS") THEN
	RESULT fcIgnore
END
...
RESULT fcCopy
```

To avoid copying the "WrongFile.XLS" file, the procedure returns the *fcIgnore* constant. The procedure is automatically called for the next copied file, without copying the current file.
