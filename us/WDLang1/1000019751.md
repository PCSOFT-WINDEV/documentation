Returns the pointer index (finger or stylus) that triggered the call of a specific multi-touch event in an Image control.

This index can be used by [GesturePosX](../WDLang1/1000019741.md) and/or [GesturePosY](../WDLang1/1000019745.md) to get the vertical and/or horizontal position of the corresponding pointer.

### Limitations
<a name="limitations_ELTPARAGRAPHE000066"></a>



- **Use condition**: 

	- This function must be called in the events of an Image control that triggered the call to the events for each pointer: option "Recall processes for each pointer (multiple pointers)" in the "Details" tab of the control description.  

	- This function must be called in one of the following events of the control: "Pressed", "Released", "Scroll with finger", "Horizontal and vertical swipe" or "Zoom with finger". Otherwise, the function will always return 1.

### Miscellaneous
<a name="miscellaneous_ELTPARAGRAPHE000100"></a>

- To find out the horizontal position (X) of a pointer, use [GesturePosX](../WDLang1/1000019741.md).

- To find out the vertical position (Y) of a pointer, use [GesturePosY](../WDLang1/1000019745.md).

- To find out the number of pointers in contact with the screen, use [GestureNbPointer](../WDLang1/1000019750.md).
