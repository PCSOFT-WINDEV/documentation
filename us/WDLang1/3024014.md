Encrypts a character string in binary format or in ASCII format.

**Remarks**:

- This character string can be decrypted by [Decrypt](../WDLang1/3024035.md).

- If the encryption and the decryption are performed on different platforms (encryption in Android and decryption in Windows for example), use [EncryptStandard](../WDLang1/1000021293.md) and [DecryptStandard](../WDLang1/1000021294.md). For more details, refer to the "Remarks" paragraph.

```wl
// Encrypt a string
Res = Encrypt("My credit card number is 52327453829011", "Password")
```

## Syntax

`<Result> = Encrypt(<String to encrypt> , <Password> [, <Type of encryption> [, <Format of encrypted string>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Character string)`**



- Encrypted character string,

- Empty string ("") if an error occurred. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md).




**`<String to encrypt>: (Character string)`**

Text to encrypt.

**`<Password>: (Character string)`**

Password used to encrypt the character string. This password will be used to decrypt the encrypted string ([Decrypt](../WDLang1/3024035.md)). A long password optimizes the encryption security.

**`<Type of encryption>: (Optional constant (or combination of constants))`**

Indicates the type of encryption and/or compression:

- Type of encryption:
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *cryptAnsi* | The encryption is identical to the one performed in a WINDEV or WEBDEV application. Useful for the applications that encrypt in WINDEV Mobile and that decrypt in WINDEV for example.<br>To use this constant, &lt;Format of encrypted string&gt; must correspond to the *encodePCS* constant.<br><br>**Remark**: If the *cryptAnsi* constant is not combined with another constant that specifies the type of encryption, the &lt;Password&gt; parameter is ignored.<br>**This constant can only be used in WINDEV Mobile for Windows CE.**<br><br><br>![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This constant has no effect. |
| *cryptFast*<br>(Default value) | Priority is given to the encryption speed (algorithm on 128 bits).<br><br><br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) The algorithm used will be a Blowfish algorithm.<br><br><br><br> |
| *cryptNone* | No encryption is performed |
| *cryptRC516* | Priority is given to the encryption security (RC5 algorithm on 16 rounds).<br><br><br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This constant has no effect. |
| *cryptSecure* | Priority is given to the encryption security (RC5 algorithm on 128 bits).<br><br><br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) The algorithm used will be a PBE algorithm (Password Based Encryption).<br><br> |






- Type of compression:
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *compressLZW* | The string will be compressed before it is encrypted.<br><br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This constant has no effect. |
| *compressNone*<br>(Default value) | No compression is performed.<br><br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This constant has no effect. |
| *compressShortString* | The string will be compressed via an algorithm optimized for the short character strings. This compression will be effective only if the *cryptNone* constant is selected and if &lt;Format of encrypted string&gt; corresponds to the *encodeNone* constant.<br><br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This constant has no effect. |






**`<Format of encrypted string>: (Optional Integer constant)`**

Indicates the format of encrypted string:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *encodeBASE64* | BASE 64 format. The file is encrypted with the BASE64 algorithm. The encrypted file will be larger (about 30%) than the initial file. <br>To perform an encoding in base 64, you also have the ability to use [Encode](../WDLang1/1000022258.md) associated with the *encodeBASE64* or *encodeBASE64URL* constant.<br>The base64 format can be used to insert an encrypted file into the email body for example. |
| *encodeNone* | Binary format. The encrypted file may contain non-printable characters. The file will be larger (about 4 bytes) than the initial file. |
| *encodePCS*<br>(Default value) | ASCII format. The encrypted file will contain printable characters only. The encrypted file will be larger (about 30%) than the initial file. <br>This format can be used to insert an encrypted file into the email body for example. |
| *encodeUUEncode* | UUEncode format. The file is encrypted with the UUEncode algorithm. The encrypted file will be larger (about 30%) than the initial file. <br>This format can be used to insert an encrypted file into the email body for example. |





![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This parameter is ignored. The encrypted string will be in BASE 64 format.

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png)![User code (UMC)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/MCU.png) 

### Binary format of an encrypted string
<a name="binary_format_encrypted_string_ELTPARAGRAPHE000244"></a>

The encrypted string must be handled properly when &lt;Format of encrypted string&gt; corresponds to the *encodeNone* constant. Indeed, this encrypted string may contain end of string characters. In this case, the string will be truncated by the display operations.

Part of the encrypted information will be lost if:

1. The encrypted string is displayed in a control.

2. The value of this control is used for the decryption.




However, no information will be lost if the encrypted string is handled as a string variable.

### Encrypting and decrypting an external file
<a name="encrypting_and_decrypting_external_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000259"></a>

To encrypt/decrypt an external file, use [fEncrypt](../WDLang1/3036013.md) and [fDecrypt](../WDLang1/3036018.md).

### Encryption in Android/Java and decryption by a WINDEV application (or conversely)
<a name="encryption_androidjava_and_decryption_windev_application_conversely_ELTPARAGRAPHE000289"></a>

Caution: the encryption/decryption algorithms used in Java and Android differ from the ones used by WINDEV. Therefore, you cannot encrypt a character string in Java or Android and decrypt it with WINDEV (and conversely). 

To encrypt a character string in Java or Android and to decrypt it with WINDEV (or conversely), use [EncryptStandard](../WDLang1/1000021293.md) and [DecryptStandard](../WDLang1/1000021294.md).
