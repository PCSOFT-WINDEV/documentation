Explicitly creates a mutex. 

**Reminder**: A mutex (MUTual EXclusion) is a critical section that can be specific to an application or shared among several applications. A mutex is used to manage an exclusive access to a resource shared between several threads. For example, a mutex can be used to handle a shared memory zone.
