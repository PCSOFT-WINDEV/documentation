Starts recording a test scenario (also called reproduction scenario).

The reproduction scenario is a ".wsct" file containing the test scenario. 

This file can be supplied to the application designer. To include this scenario in the automated tests of the application, go to the "Automated tests" tab, "Tests" group, expand "New" and select "Import a scenario recorded on the application".

For more details, see [Scenario created by the user](../Editeurs/2019031.md).

## Example


```wl
dbgStartRecording()
```

## Syntax

`<Result> = dbgStartRecording([<Name of scenario file>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the recording was started, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise.




**`<Name of scenario file>: (Optional character string)`**

Location and name of the scenario file to create. The name and location of the file can be: 

- fully customized. 

- built using the following keywords: 
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [%ExeDir%] | Directory of the executable, always filled with the "\\" character. This directory is equivalent to the result of [fExeDir](../WDLang1/3036049.md). |
| [%ExeName%] | Executable name. |
| [%Date%] | Start date of scenario (YYYYMMDD format). |
| [%Time%] | Start time of scenario (HHMMSS format). |
| [%UserName%] | Name of the current user. |
| [%ComputerName%] | Computer name. |
| [%DataDir%] | Directory of the HFSQL data files specified by the user when installing the application. This directory is equivalent to the result of [fDataDir](../WDLang1/3036001.md). |
| [%DirUserData%] | Directory for the data of the current user of the current application.  This directory is equivalent to the result of [fDataDirUser](../WDLang1/3036071.md). |





By default, the name of the scenario file corresponds to: "[%UserDataDir%][%ExeName%]_[%Date%]_[%Time%]". 
For example: "C:\\Users\\Doc\\AppData\\Roaming\\WINDEV Applications\\MyApp\\Myapp_20161023_130812.wsct". 

Caution: If you use the dynamic string construction ("Allow "[% %]" in the strings" in the "Compilation" tab of the project description), a compilation error occurs (unknown identifier). In this case, each string must be preceded by '-%'. Example: 

```wl
dbgStartRecording("[%DirUserData%][%ExeName%]_[%Date%]_[%Time%]")
```
 becomes
```wl
dbgStartRecording(-%"[%DirUserData%][%ExeName%]_[%Date%]_[%Time%]")
```

## Remarks


- **dbgStartRecording** has no effect if a scenario is already being recorded.

- [dbgEndRecording](../WDLang1/1000017161.md) is used to end the recording of the scenario.

- The recording of the scenario can also be started via the ".wx" file found beside the executable. For more details, see [Scenario created by the user](../Editeurs/2019031.md).
