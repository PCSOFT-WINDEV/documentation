<a name="description"></a>
Displays a custom message in a non-blocking system information window for a given amount of time. After the timeout, the system window is automatically closed.

Remarks: 

- **This is a non-blocking error window**. The WLanguage code that follows the call to **InfoWithTimeoutAsynchronous** continues to run. To close the window, the user must validate the OK button or wait for the end of the timeout. When the user clicks "OK", the code of a WLanguage procedure can be run.

- In the WLanguage code following the call to the function, another modal window cannot be opened before closing the dialog box. 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) WINDEV allows you to apply the skin template of your project to this dialog box. For more details, see [Customizing dialog boxes](../WDLang1/3021003.md).
