The **AutomaticEvent** type is used to manage an automatic event. An automatic event is used to simplify the synchronization between several threads.

After its opening, an "Automatic" event is automatically closed as soon as a single thread is unlocked.

**Remark**: We recommend that you use an **AutomaticEvent** or [ManualEvent](../WDLang1/1000021275.md) variable to create an event rather than naming it using a character string. Indeed, using a variable allows you to: 

- manage the variable scope, 

- avoid having 2 events with the same name in 2 different threads.

## Example


```wl
// MAIN THREAD
//------------------
// Define the event
s is AutomaticEvent
// Start the thread
ThreadExecute("Thread", threadNormal, ProcThread, s)

// Code in parallel with the thread
...
// Wait for the event triggered by the thread
EventWait("s")
```

```wl
// SECONDARY THREAD
// ----------------------
PROCEDURE ProcThread(s)

// Code in the thread
...
// Unlock the main thread
EventOpen(s)
```







## Declaration
<a name="declaration_ELTTEXTE000174"></a>
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

### Declaring an automatic event (simple syntax)

`MyVariable is AutomaticEvent`
---

In this case, the automatic event is closed when it is created.


<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Declaring an automatic event (advanced syntax)

`MyVariable is AutomaticEvent(<Initial state>)`
---

**`<Initial state>: (Integer constant)`**

Initial state of the event: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *eventOpen* | The event is open when it is created. |
| *eventClose* | The event is closed when it is created. |

### Using the AutomaticEvent variables
<a name="using_the_automaticevent_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000068"></a>

The **AutomaticEvent** variables can be used to synchronize threads in functions: 

- standard syntax: 
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [EventClose](../WDLang1/1000021272.md) | Closes a synchronization event between several threads. |
| [EventOpen](../WDLang1/1000021271.md) | Opens a synchronization event between several threads. |
| [EventWait](../WDLang1/3077007.md) | Locks the current thread while waiting for the specified event to be opened. |

- prefix syntax: 
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [&lt;AutomaticEvent variable&gt;.Close](../WDLang1/1000024383.md) | Closes a synchronization event between several threads. |
| [&lt;AutomaticEvent variable&gt;.Open](../WDLang1/1000024385.md) | Opens a synchronization event between several threads. |
| [&lt;AutomaticEvent variable&gt;.Wait](../WDLang1/1000024380.md) | Locks the current thread while waiting for the specified event to be opened. |




When [EventOpen](../WDLang1/1000021271.md) (or [&lt;AutomaticEvent variable&gt;.Open](../WDLang1/1000024385.md)) is called: 

- if there is at least one pending thread, a single thread is freed. 

- if there is no pending thread, the event remains open until a thread calls [EventWait](../WDLang1/3077007.md) (or [&lt;AutomaticEvent variable&gt;.Wait](../WDLang1/1000024380.md)).
