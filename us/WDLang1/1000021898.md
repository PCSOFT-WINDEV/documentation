Declares how to cancel an action that was added by [WinEdDo](../WDLang1/1000021897.md). This function is linked to the "UI modification by end user" feature.

This function is mainly used when creating an editor through programming (see "Remarks").

## Example


```wl
WinEdDo(WIN_MyEditor, ProcCreateCap, "New")
INTERNAL PROCEDURE ProcCreateCap(sCap)
	pNew is Control
	pNew <- ControlCreate("STC_" + GetIdentifier(), typText, 150, 150, 80, 20)
	pNew.Caption = sCap 
	WinEdDeclareUndo(ProcCancel)
	INTERNAL PROCEDURE ProcCancel()
		ControlDelete(pNew)
	END
END
```

```wl
WinEdDeclareUndo(UndoOperation, CUSTOMER.CustomerID)

// Management of Undo
INTERNAL PROCEDURE UndoOperation(nCustomerID)

IF HReadSeekFirst(CUSTOMER, CustomerID, nCustomerID) THEN
    SourceToScreen()
END
```

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`WinEdDeclareUndo(<WLanguage procedure> [, <Parameter 1> [... [, <Parameter N>]]])`
---

**`<WLanguage procedure>: (Procedure name)`**

Name of WLanguage procedure to run. The code of this procedure must allow to cancel the action created by [WinEdDo](../WDLang1/1000021897.md).

Using an internal procedure provides a direct access to the local variables. 

**`<Parameter 1>: (Any optional type)`**

First optional parameter that will be passed to the procedure. 
 In most cases, these parameter are values used to restore the previous status. 



**`<Parameter N>: (Any optional type)`**

Nth optional parameter that will be passed to the procedure.
 In most cases, these parameter are values used to restore the previous status.

## Remarks


### Use example
<a name="use_example_ELTPARAGRAPHE000050"></a>

[WinEdDo](../WDLang1/1000021897.md) is used to create custom actions (control creation for example) that support the undo/redo feature.

Let's take a simple example: creating a graphic object editor. 

A button is used to create a shape. The user must have the ability to cancel the shape creation. The following operations are performed: 

- The window switches to edit mode ([WinEdActive](../WDLang1/1000021843.md)). 

- The [WinEdDo](../WDLang1/1000021897.md) function is called. The procedure called by this function is used to create the shape. This procedure also contains the call to **WinEdDeclareUndo**. **WinEdDeclareUndo** is used to define the behavior in case of cancellation by the user. 

- The window switches to standard mode ([WinEdActive](../WDLang1/1000021843.md)). 




The end user can cancel this action (Ctrl  + Z or [WinEdUndo](../WDLang1/1000021904.md)): then, the &lt;WLanguage procedure&gt; will be called.

### Error
<a name="error_ELTPARAGRAPHE000085"></a>

A WLanguage error occurs if **WinEdDeclareUndo** is called outside a procedure added by [WinEdDo](../WDLang1/1000021897.md).
