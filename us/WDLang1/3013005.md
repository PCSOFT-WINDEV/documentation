## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000117"></a>
The management of remote control uses a file in INI format. This control file enables you to easily manage the runtime mode of an application as well as the messages displayed according to the mode. By default, this file is named WDUPDATE.NET.

WDADMINEXE allows you to easily manage the creation and the maintenance of this control file.

## Structure of control file
<a name="structure_control_file_ELTTEXTE000141"></a>
The structure of the control file is as follows:


```txt
[<Name of the EXE file to control>]
MODE = 
MSG_INTERDIT = 
MSG_AVERTISSEMENT =
MSG_ARRET =
DELAI =
TEMPS_AFFICHAGE =
```
This structure is repeated for each executable that must be controlled by the control file.

The control file contains the following elements:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| Name of EXE file to check | Name of the executable to control. If the executable is SALESMGT.EXE, the name of the EXE file to control will be SALESMGT. |
| Mode | Mode of the controlled application:<br><br>- 0: standard operating mode of the application<br><br>- 1 (*acForbidden* mode): access denied to the application<br><br>- 2 (*acWarning* mode): warning of imminent shutdown<br><br>- 3 (*acStop* mode): application shutdown<br><br><br> |
| MSG_INTERDIT | Message to display if the access to the application is forbidden (*acForbidden* mode).<br>This message will be displayed to each new user who tries to connect to the application. |
| MSG_AVERTISSEMENT | Message to display to inform of an imminent shutdown of the application (*acWarning* mode).<br>This message will be displayed at regular time intervals to inform the user and to allow him to complete the current task before the application stops. |
| MSG_ARRET | Message to display to inform of the application shutdown (*acStop* mode).<br>This message will be displayed before the application stops. |
| DELAI | Timeout for checking the control file (expressed in minutes). This timeout is set to 5 minutes by default. |
