## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000248"></a>
The programmed Drag and Drop is used to entirely manage Drag/Drop between the different types of controls. Depending on its type, the control can be source or target of Drag and Drop. 

This help page presents: 

- [the controls taken into account by the programmed Drag and Drop](#NOTE2_1). 

- [the different steps of programmed Drag and Drop](#NOTE3_1). 




Detailed examples for using the programmed Drag and Drop are available: 

- [Example of programmed Drag and Drop in WINDEV](../WDLang1/3030018.md). 

- [Example of programmed Drag and Drop in WEBDEV](../WDLang1/3030017.md).

## Controls taken into account by the programmed Drag and Drop
<a name="controls_taken_into_account_the_programmed_drag_and_drop_ELTTEXTE000272"></a>
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) The following controls are taken into account by the programmed Drag and Drop: 

| Source of Drag and Drop | Target of Drag and Drop |
| --- | --- |
| Only the following controls:<br><br>- Edit control<br><br>- List box and listview<br><br>- TreeView<br><br>- Table<br><br>- Image<br><br>- Bar code<br><br>- Button<br><br>- Looper<br><br>- Chart<br><br>- TreeView Table<br><br>- Calendar<br><br>- Organizer<br><br>- Scheduler<br><br><br> | All types of controls except:<br><br>- Progress Bar<br><br>- ActiveX<br><br>- OLE<br><br>- Shape<br><br>- Toolbar<br><br>- HTML<br><br>- Web Camera<br><br>- Video conference<br><br><br> |


Caution: the "Touch scrolling" option must not be checked in the control description window. Otherwise, the programmed Drag and Drop will fail.

## Principle
<a name="principle_ELTTEXTE000302"></a>
To perform a programmed Drag and Drop between several controls of a WINDEV application or WEBDEV site: 

1. In the initialization code of the source control:

	- Define that a programmed "Drag and Drop" will be performed ([DndSource](../Proprietes/2510014.md) property).

	- Define the procedure run at the beginning of the "Drag" action ([DnDEvent](../WDLang1/3030006.md) for the ***dndBeginDrag*** event).




2. In the initialization code of the target control:

	- Define that a programmed "Drag and Drop" will be performed ([DndTarget](../Proprietes/2510016.md) property).

	- Define the procedure run when hovering the control ([DnDEvent](../WDLang1/3030006.md) for the ***dndDragOver*** event). In this procedure, you have the ability to define the mouse cursor with [DnDCursor](../WDLang1/3030004.md). 

	- Define the procedure run during the "Drop" on the control ([DnDEvent](../WDLang1/3030006.md) for the ***dndDrop*** event).




3. In each one of the WLanguage procedures called, define the action to run via [the "Drag and Drop" functions of WLanguage](../WDLang1/3030011.md).

### Programmed Drag and Drop - Simplified mode
<a name="programmed_drag_and_drop_simplified_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000145"></a>

To enable the programmed Drag and Drop, you also have the ability to enable the Drag and Drop processes in the code of the control. 
This activation replaces the call to [DnDEvent](../WDLang1/3030006.md) as well as the creation of the associated procedures. However, this simplified management is only available for the following types of controls:

- Table, 

- TreeView, 

- TreeView Table, 

- Looper.




Equivalence between [DnDEvent](../WDLang1/3030006.md) and the processes for managing Drag and Drop: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| **Full programmed mode**<br>Constant used by DndEvent(Procedure Name, Control, Constant) | **Simplified programmed mode**<br><br><br>Process of the control |
| DndBeginDrag | Beginning of source Drag/Drop (DndBeginDrag) |
| DndDragEnter | Entry in target Drag/Drop (DndDragEnter) |
| DndDragLeave | Exit in source Drag/Drop (DndDragLeave) |
| DndDragOver | Rollover in target Drag/Drop (DndDragOver) |
| DndDrop | Drop in target Drag/Drop (DndDrop) |
| DndEndDrag | End of source Drag/Drop (DndEndDrag) |


The procedure code will be inserted in the process of the control.
