## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000143"></a>
To customize the remote control performed on a multi-user WINDEV application, the standard window can be replaced with a window from your application.

This window will be used:

- to display the message indicating that the connection cannot be established, 

- to display the warning message, 

- to display the message for closing the application.




This window must respect some norms, both for display and programming.

## Characteristics of window
<a name="characteristics_window_ELTTEXTE000167"></a>
The custom window must contain the following elements:

- a control used to display the message to the users, 

- a procedure used to retrieve the parameters passed to the window (see the programming paragraph).




This window can contain any control, process, etc. custom.

## Programming

### Procedure associated with the custom window
<a name="procedure_associated_with_the_custom_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000038"></a>

A procedure must be declared in the global declaration of global variables of the window. Indeed, when this window is opened by the mechanism for remote control, the parameters passed to this window can be retrieved by programming.

This window must be associated with a procedure of the following type:


```txt
PROCEDURE <Window Name>(<Mode>, <Message>, <Display Duration>)
```
where the parameters are as follows:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| &lt;Mode&gt; | Retrieves as constants the current mode for remote control:<br><br>- *acForbidden*: access denied to the application<br><br>- *acWarning*: warning of imminent shutdown<br><br>- *acStop*: application shutdown<br><br><br> |
| &lt;Message&gt; | Retrieves the message corresponding to the current mode (this message must be displayed in the window) |
| &lt;Display duration&gt; | Maximum display duration of the window (in seconds) |


```wl
// Declaration code of the global variables of WIN_CustomMessage
PROCEDURE WIN_CustomMess(AccessMode, MessageToDisplay, DispDuration)
SWITCH AccessMode
	CASE acForbidden: IMG_IconControl.Image = "Forbidden.BMP"
	CASE acWarning: IMG_IconControl.Image = "Info.BMP"
	CASE acStop: IMG_IconControl.Image = "Stop.BMP"
END
EDT_MessageControl = MessageToDisplay
```

<a name="NOTE3_2"></a>


### Calling the custom window
<a name="calling_the_custom_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000069"></a>

To use the custom window to automatically check your application, [AppControl](../WDLang1/3013003.md) must be called in the initialization code of your project:


```wl
AppliControl("U:\MyApp\WDUPDATE.NET", WIN_CustomMessage)
```


where: 

- WIN_CustomMess is the name of the custom window, 

- "WDUPDATE.NET" is the control file of the application.




Tip: The call to [AppControl](../WDLang1/3013003.md) must be the first statement found in the initialization code of project.

### Stopping the application
<a name="stopping_the_application_ELTPARAGRAPHE000091"></a>

When using a custom window, the stop mode defined for the application (*acStop* constant) does not automatically stop the application. The call to [EndProgram](../WDLang1/3013033.md) must be included in your application.
