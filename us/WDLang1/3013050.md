### Use conditions according to the platforms
<a name="use_conditions_according_the_platforms_ELTPARAGRAPHE000081"></a>

![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) **Trace** can be used to display the requested information in a file only. By default, this file is created in the UNIX temporary directory and is named "Trace_&lt;Project&gt;.txt".

### Trace window
<a name="trace_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000125"></a>

- The information passed as parameter is displayed on the next line of the trace window.

- The trace window opens automatically the first time **Trace** is called ([TraceStart](../WDLang1/3013052.md) is executed automatically). By default, this window is opened in the upper-left corner of the screen.

- **Trace** is similar to [Info](../WDLang1/3021011.md) but the information is displayed in another window and no key needs to be pressed.

### Context menu of the trace window
<a name="context_menu_the_trace_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000149"></a>

The context menu of the trace window allows you to:

- copy/cut/paste the content of trace window.

- save the content of the trace window in a text file. 
	Caution: This option is available only if the wdxxxstd.dll library is on the end-user computer.

- clear the contents of the trace window.

- open the trace window on top of all the other windows (including the windows from the other applications).

- save the size and position of the trace window when it is closed. When this window is displayed again, it will keep the size and position saved.

- display a horizontal scrollbar.

- display special characters in gray or use them directly: EOT, TAB, etc. Therefore, the "Carriage Return" (CR) characters in the trace window are represented as "&lt;\\r&gt;&lt;\\n&gt;".
	Remark: This option will be taken into account from the next line of information displayed.
