Returns the appointment, the resource or the date found at given position in a Scheduler control.

**Caution**:  [MouseXPos](../WDLang1/3071007.md) and [MouseYPos](../WDLang1/3071008.md) return a relevant information in the processes linked to the mouse or to the stylus (click code, rollover code, code of left or right button down, ...).

## Example


```wl
// Displays in the trace the date found at hovered location 
// (optional WM_MOUSEMOVE event)
// The result would also be obtained in the code of left button up (WM_LBUTTONUP)
// Not to be used in the code for "Selecting a period" in the Scheduler control 
// that is not linked to the mouse

MyDate is string
MyDate = SCH_Schedule1.InfoXY(schDateTime + schScreenOrigin, MouseXPos(), MouseYPos())
Trace(MyDate)
```

`<Result> = <Scheduler control>.InfoXY(<Type of information> , <X> , <Y>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Character string or Integer)`**

Requested information: 

- Index of appointment at specified point, -1 if there is no appointment. 

- Date and time (in YYYYMMDDHHSSCC format) of appointment at specified point, empty string ("") if there is no date. 

- Name of resource at specified point, empty string ("") if there is no resource.




**`<Scheduler control>: (Control name)`**

Name of Scheduler control to use.

**`<Type of information>: (Integer constant (or combination of constants))`**

Type of information requested:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *schAppointment* | Index of the appointment at the specified coordinates. |
| *schDateTime* | Date and time of the appointment corresponding to the specified coordinates. |
| *schResource* | Name of resource corresponding to specified coordinates. |
| *schScreenOrigin* | By default, the (0,0) point corresponds to the top left point of Scheduler control used (the scrollbars being located at the origin).<br>If the *schScreenOrigin* constant is combined with the other constants, the (0,0) point corresponds to the origin of the screen.<br>This constant cannot be used on its own.<br><br> |



**`<X>: (Integer)`**

X-coordinate (in pixels) to be analyzed. This coordinate is given in relation to the Scheduler control (if the *schScreenOrigin* constant is not specified).

**`<Y>: (Integer)`**

Y-coordinate (in pixels) to be analyzed. This coordinate is given in relation to the Scheduler control (if the *schScreenOrigin* constant is not specified).
