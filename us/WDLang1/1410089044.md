## Syntax

### Reading a block of bytes in an external file

`<Result> = <File used>.Read(<Number of bytes to read>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Character string)`**



- Block of bytes that was read. 

- Empty string ("") if an error occurred. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) with the *errMessage* constant.




**`<File used>: (DiskFile variable)`**

Name of the [DiskFile](../WDLang1/1410088883.md) variable initialized with [fOpen](../WDLang1/3036036.md) or [fCreate](../WDLang1/3036017.md).

**`<Number of bytes to read>: (Integer)`**

Number of bytes to read (up to 2 147 483 648 bytes). 

If the data is a Unicode string, the number of bytes to read corresponds to: 

- in UTF16: the number of characters multiplied by 2.

- in UTF32: the number of characters multiplied by 4.

### Reading the content of an external file and assigning it to a memory area (identified by its address)

`<Result> = <File used>.Read(<Number of bytes to read> , <Address>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**



- Number of bytes read, 

- 0 if an error occurs. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) with the *errMessage* constant.




**`<File used>: (DiskFile variable)`**

Name of the [DiskFile](../WDLang1/1410088883.md) variable initialized with [fOpen](../WDLang1/3036036.md) or [fCreate](../WDLang1/3036017.md).

**`<Number of bytes to read>: (Integer)`**

Number of bytes to read (up to 2 147 483 648 bytes). 

If the data is a Unicode string, the number of bytes to read corresponds to: 

- in UTF16: the number of characters multiplied by 2.

- in UTF32: the number of characters multiplied by 4.




**`<Address>: (Address)`**

Address of affected memory section.

## Remarks


### Handling errors
<a name="handling_errors_ELTPARAGRAPHE000335"></a>

**&lt;DiskFile variable&gt;.Read** throws an error in the following cases:

- the file is not opened, 

- the file is not accessible in read mode, 

- the file is locked by another computer or by another application, 

- therefore, the end of file is reached.



<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Position in the file
<a name="position_the_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000352"></a>

When opening a file, the current position corresponds to:

- the first file byte (by default), 

- the last byte of the file is the file is opened in "addition" mode (*foAdd* constant).




This position can be modified by [&lt;DiskFile variable&gt;.Seek](../WDLang1/1410089048.md).

**&lt;DiskFile variable&gt;.Read** reads the specified elements from the current position. Once **&lt;DiskFile variable&gt;.Read** has been executed, the current position is set to the last byte read.

Remark: To always read the beginning of the file, you must call [&lt;DiskFile variable&gt;.Seek](../WDLang1/1410089048.md) and then **&lt;DiskFile variable&gt;.Read**.
