The statement **USING ... IN** makes it possible to automatically perform initialization and ending operations on critical sections. 

This statement makes it possible to "forget" these operations (mainly ending operations) and to make the code more readable for highlighting the block to which the functionality relates.

## Example


```wl
// Using a Critical Section variable
S is CriticalSection

// Use for a code block
//---------------------------
USING S IN
	// code protected by the critical section
	// only one thread will execute this code at a given moment
END
```


<a name="Example2"></a>



```wl
// Use of a named critical section
USING CriticalSection("MySection") IN
	// Two threads will not be able to run this code at the same time
	...
END
```


<a name="Example3"></a>



```wl
// Critical section on a variable
t is array <critical section> of int

USING CriticalSection(t) IN
	// Operations on the array by one only thread at a time
	...
END
```

### Defining a global section

`USING CriticalSection() IN
     ...
END
`
---

**`<USING IN>: ()`**

Marks the beginning of the statement block.

**`<CriticalSection>: ()`**

Enables the critical section. For more details, see [CriticalSection](../WDLang1/1000024373.md).

### Defining a named critical section

`USING CriticalSection(<Section name>) IN

     ...
END
`
---

**`<USING IN>: ()`**

Marks the beginning of the statement block.

**`<CriticalSection>: ()`**

Enables the critical section. For more details, see [CriticalSection](../WDLang1/1000024373.md).
