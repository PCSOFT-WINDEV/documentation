**MyChildWindow** is used to handle the child window of the current window. When running the window, **MyChildWindow** is replaced by the window (and not by the name of the window).

**Use**: **MyChildWindow** can only be used in the "Close a child window" event. This keyword is used to handle in this code the characteristics of the child window that was closed. This allows you to retrieve: 

- the name of the child window that was closed by the [Name](../Proprietes/2510082.md) property. 

- the value returned by the child window via the [ReturnedValue](../Proprietes/2510134.md) property.

## Example


```wl
// Event "Close a child window of WIN_List_Customers"
// -------------------------------------------------------------
// Refreshes the list of customers
LooperDisplay(LOOP_Customers, taReExecuteQuery)

// For any return (except for the deletion)
IF MyChildWindow.ReturnedValue <> -1 THEN
	nIndex is int
	// Finds the customer row
	nIndex = LooperSearch(ATT_CustomerNum, Customer.CustomerNum)
	IF nIndex > 0 THEN
		// Positions on the customer row
		LooperPosition(LOOP_Customers, nIndex)
	END
END

## Remarks


### Finding out the value returned by a child window
<a name="finding_out_the_value_returned_child_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000052"></a>

In the mobile applications, the windows are opened by [OpenMobileWindow](../WDLang1/1000021018.md) (or [OpenChild](../WDLang1/3038021.md)) instead of [Open](../WDLang1/3038035.md). 

**MyChildWindow** allows you to get the name of the child window closed as well as the value it has returned, when used in the "Close a child window" event of the parent window (the window in which [OpenMobileWindow](../WDLang1/1000021018.md) or [OpenChild](../WDLang1/3038021.md) were called).

For example:

- In the closing code of the child window, [Close](../WDLang1/3038018.md) is used to return a parameter: 
	
	```wl
	Close("", MyParameter)
	```


- The name of the child window as well as the returned value can be retrieved in the "Close a child window" event of the calling window: 
	
	```wl
	// Close a child window
	NameChildWindow = MyChildWindow.Name
	ValueChildWindow = MyChildWindow.ReturnedValue
	```
