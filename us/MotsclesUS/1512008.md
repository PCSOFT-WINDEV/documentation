## Use
<a name="use_ELTTEXTE000185"></a>
The arithmetic operators are:

- "+": Addition (numeric value or string)

- "-": Subtraction (numeric value)

- "\*": Multiplication

- "/": Division

- "++": Increment (numeric value)

- "--": Decrement (numeric value)

- "+=": Adding a value to the variable or to the control (numeric or text)

- "-=": Subtracting a value from the variable or from the control (numeric)

- [Modulo](../Motscles/1511002.md): Returns the remainder of a division

- "^": Power (equivalent to [Power](../WDLang1/3050007.md))

## Rules

### Calculation rules
<a name="calculation_rules_ELTPARAGRAPHE000069"></a>

The different calculations are performed without loss of precision and without being truncated. The flow checks are performed when the result is assigned to a variable.

### Displaying the result
<a name="displaying_the_result_ELTPARAGRAPHE000078"></a>

The result of the calculation can be directly displayed using the following operators:

- "++": Increment

- "--": Decrement




When the ++ (--) operator is used as an expression (e.g.: Info(x++)), its behavior is determined by the position of the operator, relative to the incremented variable:

- ++x (--x) => increments (decrements) x then returns x.

- x++ (x--) => returns the value of x then increments (decrements) x. 




For example: 


```wl
let x is int = 5
Trace(x++) 	// Displays 5. x is set to 6 
Trace(++x) 	// Displays 7. x is set to 7
Trace(--x) 	// Displays 6. x is set to 6
Trace(x--) 	// Displays 6. x is set to 5
Trace(x)	// Displays 5
```


The result of the calculation cannot be directly displayed by the following operators:

- "+=": Adding a value to the variable or to the control (numeric or text)

- "-=": Subtracting a value from the variable or from the control (numeric)




Therefore, this example generates an error during the compilation:


```wl
num is int = 10
Trace(num+=1)
```


To display the result, perform the following modifications:


```wl
num is int = 10
num += 1
Trace(num)
```

### Equivalence
<a name="equivalence_ELTPARAGRAPHE000131"></a>

- j ++ is equivalent to j = j + 1

- j -- is equivalent to j = j - 1

- j += 3 is equivalent to j = j + 3

- j -= 3 is equivalent to j = j - 3




We recommend that you use the following syntaxes: "j ++", "j --", "j +=" and "j -=", that are faster than the usual syntaxes.
