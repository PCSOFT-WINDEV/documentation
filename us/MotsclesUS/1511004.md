**MyWindow** is used to handle the current window. During the execution of the window, **MyWindow** is replaced with the window (and not by the name of the window). Therefore, **MyWindow** can be used like a window.

**Benefit**: **MyWindow** is used to make local code (control, button, ...) or global code (global procedure, class, ...) independent of the current window.

## Remarks




### Handling the current window
<a name="handling_the_current_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000056"></a>

- **MyWindow** is always replaced with the current window. For example, using the [Title](../Proprietes/2510090.md) property:
	
	```wl
	MyWindow..Title = "Type your data"
	MyCurrentTitle = MyWindow..Title
	 
	// Pass as parameter:
	CallProcedure(MyWindow)
	```


- If the **MyWindow** keyword must be converted to a string, the result of the [Value](../Proprietes/2510130.md) property is returned. For a window, the [Value](../Proprietes/2510130.md) property returns the title of the window.
	
	```wl
	Trace(MyWindow) // Returns the title of the window
	```

	Example not to do:
	
	```wl
	ExecuteProcess(MyWindow, trtChange)
	```

	To do:
	
	```wl
	ExecuteProcess(MyWindow..Name, trtChange)
	```


- **MyWindow** can only be used in the processes that handle the current window (in the processes associated with a control, a window, ...). **MyWindow** cannot be used in a report. To specify the current report in a report, use [MyReport](../Motscles/1511010.md)

- The **MyWindow** keyword does not allow you to use the global variables declared in the window.

- To handle a window control by using the **MyWindow** keyword, you have the ability to use the following syntax:
	
	```wl
	Info({MyWindow..Name + ".Button2"}..Caption)
	```

### Using MyWindow in a procedure
<a name="using_mywindow_procedure_ELTPARAGRAPHE000093"></a>

The **MyWindow** keyword can be used in a local procedure or in a global procedure only if the procedure handles the current window. In this case, **MyWindow** refers to the current window.

With a local procedure, **MyWindow** corresponds to the window to which the procedure belongs.

### WLanguage functions and current window
<a name="wlanguage_functions_and_current_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000103"></a>

To specify the current window in the WLanguage functions that accept a window name as parameter, use:

- an empty string, 

- **MyWindow**.
