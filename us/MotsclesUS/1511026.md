The **&lt;BLOCK&gt;** keyword is used in the code editor to declare custom blocks of code. These blocks of code are used to highlight the different steps of an algorithm and to group the declarations of variables or members. 

The defined code block can be expanded or collapsed. 

A comment can be associated with the block. This comment will always be displayed in collapsed mode. 

This keyword has no influence at runtime.
