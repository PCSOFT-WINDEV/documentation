**MySource** is used to handle the current data source (file, view or query) associated with a report or with a table based on a data file. When the project is run, this keyword is automatically replaced by the current data source.

**Benefit**: **MySource** is used to:

- Make the code independent of the current data source.

- Access the value of an item of the current record in the current data source.

- Retrieve the name of the data source to perform an HFSQL process.

- Indicate the window containing a table to print in a [report on table](../WDChamp/1011012.md).

// Retrieve the name of the customer currently printed
IF MySource.CustName = "Montgomery" THEN
	CALC_TotalBT.BackgroundColor = LightRed
END
```


<a name="Example2"></a>



```wl
// Modify the data source of a report on table in its opening code
PROCEDURE RPT_Customer_Table(sNameSourceTable)
MyReport.MySource = sNameSourceTable
```
