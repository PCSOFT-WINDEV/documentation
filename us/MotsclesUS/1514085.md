## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000093"></a>
In most cases, old code contains procedures that are used but that do no longer match the current quality standard.

In this case, a new procedure version is created, with different parameters.

As all the existing calls cannot be modified straightaway, you have the ability to indicate that the former version becomes a **zombie procedure**. 

In this case: 

- When recompiling the project, a warning is used to indicate all the calls to the zombie procedure. 

- Whenever the zombie procedure is used, a specific logo is displayed beside the call during 10 seconds and a compilation warning is generated.

- The zombie procedure appears grayed out and struck through in the "Project explorer" pane.

## How to?
<a name="how_ELTTEXTE000117"></a>
To indicate that a procedure is a zombie procedure, the procedure declaration must be followed by the &lt;Zombie&gt; attribute extension. 

The syntax is as follows: 

```txt
PROCEDURE <Procedure name>(<Parameters>) <zombie [comment = "text"]> [: <Type of return>]
PROCEDURE <Procedure name>() <zombie [comment = "text"]> [: <Type of return>]
```

In these syntaxes, the optional **comment** keyword is used to specify the text that will be displayed in the compilation error associated with the obsolete procedure. 


### Example

- Code of the procedure: 
	
	```wl
	PROCEDURE AddTreeView(sNode, sMonth, sImageDate, sImage)<zombie comment = "use AjFull">
	
	// Check to find out whether the year exists
	IF TreeStatus(TreeCommand, sNode) = tvError THEN
		// it does not exist, create it with all the months
		TreeAdd(TreeCommand, sNode, sImageDate, sImageDate, "", tvLast)
		AddMonth(sNode)
	END
	```


- The zombie procedure appears grayed out and struck through in the "Project explorer" pane (when the element is recompiled). ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=proc_zombie_3.gif)


- When typing the call to the function, a specific icon will be displayed during 10 seconds : ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Proc_zombie_1.gif)
 and a compilation error containing the comment will be displayed: ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Proc_zombie_2.gif)
