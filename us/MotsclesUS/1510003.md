The **CONTINUE** keyword can correspond: 

- the **CONTINUE** statement: 
	The **CONTINUE** statement is used to directly go to the beginning of the next iteration without ending the code of the current iteration.
	The **CONTINUE** statement can be used in the following types of loops:

	- [FOR](../Motscles/1510001.md)

	- [FOR EACH](../Motscles/1510013.md)

	- [LOOP](../Motscles/1510004.md)

	- [WHILE](../Motscles/1510010.md)




- the **CONTINUE:** label: 
	The "CONTINUE:" label is used to declare a common code in a loop. This code will be run: 

	- for each iteration of the loop. 

	- if the "CONTINUE" statement is found in the loop. In this case, the code found between the "CONTINUE" statement and the "CONTINUE:" label will not be run.

## Syntax

### CONTINUE statement used in a FOR statement

`FOR <Control variable> = <Initial value> TO <Final value> [STEP <x>]
	...    
	IF <Condition> THEN CONTINUE
	...
END`
---

**Remark**: If &lt;Condition&gt; is True:

- The code found after the **CONTINUE** statement is not run.

- The loop is run from the beginning of the [FOR](../Motscles/1510001.md) statement.

- The &lt;Control variable&gt; is incremented.

### CONTINUE statement used in a FOR EACH statement

`FOR EACH <File> ON <Key item>
    ...
    IF <Condition> THEN CONTINUE
    ...
END`
---

**Remark**: If &lt;Condition&gt; is True:

- The code found after the **CONTINUE** statement is not run.

- The loop is run from the beginning of the [FOR EACH](../Motscles/1510013.md) statement.

- The move to the next record is automatically performed.

### CONTINUE statement used in a WHILE statement

`WHILE <Condition 1>
    ...    
	IF <Condition2> THEN CONTINUE
    ...
END`
---

**Remark**: If &lt;Condition 2&gt; is True:

- The code found after the **CONTINUE** statement is not run.

- The loop is run from the beginning of the [WHILE](../Motscles/1510010.md) statement.

## Remarks


### CONTINUE statement: example not to do:
<a name="continue_statement_example_not_ELTPARAGRAPHE000080"></a>

In this code, using the **CONTINUE** keyword triggers the non-execution of [HReadNext](../WDLang4/3044037.md):


```wl
HReadFirst(Account, NoAccount)
WHILE NOT HOut()
	IF Account.NoAccount = "XXX" THEN CONTINUE
	Trace(Account.NoAccount)
	HReadNext(Account, NoAccount)
END
```

### Usage example of the "CONTINUE:" label
<a name="usage_example_the_continue_label_ELTPARAGRAPHE000094"></a>

In this example, the following elements are added:

- the amount of each invoice in the TotInv variable.

- the amount if it is a credit in the TotCredit variable .



```wl
TotalOfInvoices is Currency
TotCredit is Currency

HReadFirst(Invoice, InvNum)
WHILE NOT HOut()
	IF Invoice.Invoice_Type <> "Credit" THEN CONTINUE  
	// Goes to the CONTINUE: label directly
	// Adds the credits here
	TotCredit += Invoice.Amount

	CONTINUE:
	// Adds all the amounts
	TotInv += Invoice.Amount
	HReadNext(Invoice, InvNum)
END
```

### "CONTINUE:" statement: Case of nested loops
<a name="continue_statement_case_nested_loops_ELTPARAGRAPHE000108"></a>

When you have several nested loops, you must sometimes continue on the next iteration of one of the previous level without ending the current loop.

To do so, the **CONTINUE** statement accepts a parameter specifying the number of levels to move up. The syntax is as follows: 


```txt
CONTINUE[<Number of levels>]
```
where &lt;Number of levels&gt; is an integer between 1 and N, N representing the number of nested levels for the loop.

For example:


```wl
x, y, z are int

FOR X = 1 TO 15 // Loop 1
	FOR Y = 1 TO 25 // Loop 2
		FOR Z = 1 TO 50 // Loop 3
			IF <My_condition_is_verified> THEN
				CONTINUE(2)  
					// Stops the browse of loop 3 
					// and goes to the following iteration of loop 2
			END
		END
	END
END
```
