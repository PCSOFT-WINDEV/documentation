The keyword **BREAK** can correspond: 

- to the **BREAK** statement: 
	The **BREAK** statement is used to exit a statement block and run the rest of the current process.
	The **BREAK** statement can be used in the following types of loops:

	- [FOR](../Motscles/1510001.md)

	- [FOR EACH](../Motscles/1510013.md)

	- [LOOP](../Motscles/1510004.md)

	- [WHILE](../Motscles/1510010.md)


 Remark: The **BREAK** statement cannot be used to exit a procedure. Use the RETURN and RESULT keywords.

- **to the BREAK: label**: 
	The "BREAK:" label is used to declare a code in a loop. 

	- This code will be run when exitingfrom the loop with a "BREAK" statement. 

	- This code will never be run for each iteration of the loop.

## Syntax

### BREAK statement used in a FOR  statement

`FOR <Control variable> = <Initial value> TO <Final value> [STEP <x>]
   ...
   IF <Condition> THEN BREAK
   ...
END
<Rest of process>`
---


<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### BREAK statement used in a FOR EACH statement

`FOR EACH <File> ON <Key item>
   ...
   IF <Condition> THEN BREAK
   ...
END
<Rest of process>`
---


<a name="SYNTAX3"></a>

### BREAK statement used in a LOOP statement

`LOOP
   ...
   IF <Condition> THEN BREAK
   ...
END
<Rest of process>`
---


<a name="SYNTAX4"></a>

### BREAK statement used in a WHILE statement

`WHILE <Condition>
   ...
   IF <Condition> THEN BREAK
   ...
END
<Rest of process>`
---


<a name="SYNTAX5"></a>

`The following operations are performed if <Condition> is True:
- Exit statement block.
- Run the rest of the current process.`

## Remarks


### Other statements used to exit a loop
<a name="other_statements_used_exit_loop_ELTPARAGRAPHE000063"></a>

Several statements are available:

- [RETURN](../Motscles/1510009.md): Exit the loop and the current process (or procedure).

- [RETURN](../Motscles/1510007.md): Return a status report to the calling process. Exit the loop and the current process (or procedure).




[Close](../WDLang1/3038018.md) is used to exit the loop and close the current window.

Caution: [RETURN](../Motscles/1510009.md) and [RETURN](../Motscles/1510007.md) cannot be used in the same process.

### Usage example of the "BREAK:" label 
<a name="usage_example_the_break_label_ELTPARAGRAPHE000091"></a>In this example, the total representing the sum of the last 10 invoices is displayed. 


```wl
NbInvoices is Int
TotalOfInvoices is Currency

NbInvoices = 0
// Iterate over invoices starting from last invoice
HReadLast(ORDER, OrderNumber)
WHILE NOT HOut()
	
	IF NbInvoices >= 10 THEN BREAK // Jump directly to the BREAK: label
	// Adds the invoices
	TotalOfInvoices += ORDER.TotalInclTax
	NbInvoice ++
	
	HReadPrevious(ORDER, OrderNumber)
	BREAK:
	// Exits from the loop after 10 iterations
	Info("The total for the last 10 invoices is: ", TotalOfInvoices)
END
```

### "BREAK:" statement: Case of nested loops
<a name="break_statement_case_nested_loops_ELTPARAGRAPHE000102"></a>

When there are several nested loops, you may have to exit an iteration in order to go back to the previous level or even to a higher level.

To do so, the **BREAK** statement accepts a parameter indicating the number of levels to move up for the exit. The syntax is as follows: 


```txt
BREAK(<Number of levels>)
```
where &lt;Number of levels&gt; is an integer between 1 and N, N representing the number of nested levels for the loop.

For example:


```wl
x, y, z are int

FOR X = 1 TO 15 // Loop 1
	FOR Y = 1 TO 25 // Loop 2
		FOR Z = 1 TO 50 // Loop 3
			IF <My condition is checked> THEN
				BREAK(2) // Exits from loop 3 and loop 2
					// and goes to the next iteration in loop 1
			END
		END
	END
END
```
