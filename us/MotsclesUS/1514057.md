A dynamic array is an "advanced" type of array: the dimensions of this array are allocated upon request during the execution of the program. In most cases, a "simple" array is sufficient.

**Reminder**: An array is a structured type that is used to group a set of elements of the same type. Each element of the array can be accessed by its index.

It is recommended to use:

- A **dynamic array** or a ["simple" array](../Motscles/1514030.md) when the size of the array must be modified during the program execution.

- A [fixed array](../Motscles/1514025.md) for the Windows APIs.

- An [associative array](../Motscles/1514058.md) to store the elements indexed on any type of information.

## Example


```wl
// Declare a dynamic array
CustomerArray is dynamic array
```


<a name="Example2"></a>



```wl
// Allocate a dynamic array
CustomerArray is dynamic array

CustomerArray = new array of 4 by 7 int
// Equivalent to: CustomerArray = new array of 4,7 int
// (From version 17) Equivalent to: CustomerArray = new array [4,7] int
```


<a name="Example3"></a>





```wl
// Refer to a dynamic array
CustomerArray[2,5,3] = 47
// Equivalent to: CustomerArray[2][5][3] = 47
```

## Syntax

### Declaring a dynamic array

`<Name of dynamic array> is dynamic array
`
---

**`<Name of dynamic array>: ()`**

Name of the dynamic array variable to declare.  


<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Creating a dynamic array

`
<Name of dynamic array> = new array [ <Dimension 1> [,<Dimension 2> ... [<Dimension 10>]] ] <Type of array elements>`
---

Example:

CustomerArray is dynamic array

CustomerArray = new array [4,7] int







`<Name of dynamic array> = new array of <Dimension 1> [by <Dimension 2> ... [by <Dimension 10>]] <Type of array elements>

OR

 <Name of dynamic array> = new array of <Dimension 1> [,<Dimension 2> ... [,<Dimension 10>]] <Type of array elements>
`
---

**`<Name of dynamic array>: ()`**

Name of the dynamic array to use. This array was declared beforehand.

**`<Dimension 1>...<a name="SYNTAX3"></a>

### Referring to a dynamic array

`Remark: To refer to a dynamic array, this array must be allocated.
`
---



### Referring to a one-dimensional dynamic array

`<Array name>[Index1]`
---



### Referring to an element in a two-dimensional array:

`<Array name>[Index1, Index2]

OR

<Array name>[index1][index2]`
---



### Referring to an element in an array with N dimensions

`<Array name>[Index1,...,IndexN]

OR

<Array name>[Index1]...[IndexN]`
---



### Passing an array as parameter to a procedure:

`<Procedure name>(<Array name>)`
---

**`<Array name>: ()`**

Name of the dynamic array to use.

**`<Index1>: ()`**

Index of the element for the 1st dimension.

**`<Index2>: ()`**

Index of the element for the 2nd dimension.

**`<IndexN>: ()`**

Index of the element for the Nth dimension (N &lt;= 10).

## Remarks




### Deleting a dynamic array (optional)
<a name="deleting_dynamic_array_optional_ELTPARAGRAPHE000139"></a>

A dynamic array is automatically deleted at the end of the lifetime of the variable (e.g., when the window is closed) or when new dimensions are allocated.

To delete a dynamic array, use the following syntax:


```txt
delete <Name of dynamic array>
```


If the dynamic array is declared and allocated in the same line of code, you should not use the [Delete](../Motscles/1511012.md) keyword to delete the dynamic array. A runtime error will occur if [Delete](../Motscles/1511012.md) is used.

### Passing a dynamic array as parameter to a procedure
<a name="passing_dynamic_array_parameter_procedure_ELTPARAGRAPHE000159"></a>

A dynamic array can be passed as parameter to a procedure. To do so, use the following syntax:


```txt
<Procedure name>(<Array name>)
```


For example:


```wl
SupplierArray is dynamic array
SupplierArray = new array of 10 by 50 character strings
// Call to the DisplayArray procedure
DisplayArray(SuppArray)
```

<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>




### Declaring a dynamic array member
<a name="declaring_dynamic_array_member_ELTPARAGRAPHE000173"></a>

A "dynamic array" member can be declared in:

- a structure, 

- a composite variable, 

- a class.




The dynamic array must be allocated after the declaration of the structure or composite variable.

For example:


```wl
// Declare a structure
Struct is structure
	x1 is int
	x2 is dynamic array		// Declare the array
END

// Declare a structure variable
MyStruct is struct
// Allocate the array
x2 = new dynamic array of 4,7 int
```


**For a class**, the declaration must be done in the declaration code of the class and the allocation must be done in the class constructor.

### WLanguage functions and dynamic arrays
<a name="wlanguage_functions_and_dynamic_arrays_ELTPARAGRAPHE000193"></a>

Several WLanguage functions can be used to handle the dynamic arrays. You have the ability to perform sorts, searches, ... For more details, see [Array management functions](../WDLang1/3075006.md).
<a name="NOTE0_5"></a>




### Limits: Elements of a dynamic array
<a name="limits_elements_dynamic_array_ELTPARAGRAPHE000204"></a>

- A dynamic array can include classes only if these classes have a constructor without parameter (or with optional parameters).

- A dynamic array cannot include:

	- composite variables, 

	- arrays.







![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) No array of classes or array of structures can be created.
