## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000158"></a>
The advanced types (XLS variables, ggl variables, ...) are used to handle the data via properties.

To handle these types, you must declare a variable corresponding to the type to handle and instantiate this variable.

This help page presents:

- how to handle the properties of advanced type.

- the assignment of the advanced types.

### Using a property of an advanced variable
<a name="using_property_advanced_variable_ELTPARAGRAPHE000032"></a>

The following syntax is used to call a property of a variable:


```txt
<Variable Name> . <Property Name>
```


or 


```txt
<Variable Name>..<Property Name>
```

<a name="NOTE3_3"></a>


### Remark
<a name="remark_ELTPARAGRAPHE000045"></a>

The accesses to the properties can used in sequence. For example:


```wl
// Sequences of properties
MyCampaign..GeoTargeting..CountryTarget..Country = "FR" + CR + "DE"
```

### Assignment rules
<a name="assignment_rules_ELTPARAGRAPHE000056"></a>

The assignment rules between variables of advanced type and between dynamic variables of advanced type are as follows:


|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|   | **Operator =** | **Operator &lt;=** | **Operator &lt;-** |
| Variable of advanced type | Dynamic variable of advanced type | Variable of advanced type | Dynamic variable of advanced type | Variable of advanced type | Dynamic variable of advanced type |
| Variable of advanced type | Copies | Copies | Copies | Copies | Taking reference | Taking reference |
| Dynamic variable of advanced type | Taking reference | Taking reference | Copies | Copies | Taking reference | Taking reference |
