In a **WHILE** statement, the expression is evaluated at the beginning of the statement block.

The process loops as long as the condition expression is True. The program will exit from the statement block when the condition is False.

## Example


```wl
MyList = INIRead("Examples", "", "", INIFile)
Keyword = ExtractString(MyList, nb, CR)
WHILE Keyword <> ""
	nb = nb + 1
	ExplName = INIRead("Projects installed", Keyword, "", INIFile)
	Keyword = ExtractString(MyList, nb + 1, CR)
END
```

## Syntax

### "WHILE" condition

`WHILE <Condition>
   <Action if condition is True>
END
`
---

**`<WHILE>: ()`**

Marks the beginning of the statement block.

**`<Condition>: ()`**

Condition to check.

**`<Action if condition is True>: ()`**

Action to perform if the condition is True.

**`<END>: ()`**

Marks the end of the statement block.

### Loop with exit according to a "WHILE" condition

`LOOP
   ...
   DO WHILE <Condition>
`
---

**`<LOOP>: ()`**

Marks the beginning of the statement block.

**`<DO WHILE>: ()`**

Marks the end of the statement block. Used to exit from the statement block. The lines of the loop found before this statement are run.

## Remarks




### Code to run
<a name="code_run_ELTPARAGRAPHE000083"></a>

The code to run is found between the **WHILE** statement and the **END** statement.

### Exiting from a WHILE loop
<a name="exiting_from_while_loop_ELTPARAGRAPHE000091"></a>

Several statements are available:

- [RETURN](../Motscles/1510009.md): Exit from the **WHILE** loop and exit from the current process (or procedure).

- [RETURN](../Motscles/1510007.md): Return a status report to the calling process. Exit from the **WHILE** loop and exit from the current process (or procedure).

- [BREAK](../Motscles/1510012.md): Exit from the **WHILE** loop and run the rest of the current process.




[Close](../WDLang1/3038018.md) is used to exit from the **WHILE** loop and to close the current window.

Caution: [RETURN](../Motscles/1510009.md) and [RETURN](../Motscles/1510007.md) cannot be used in the same process.

### Loop without end
<a name="loop_without_end_ELTPARAGRAPHE000121"></a>

When compiling the project, a **WHILE** loop without an obvious end ([BREAK](../Motscles/1510012.md), [RETURN](../Motscles/1510009.md) or [RETURN](../Motscles/1510007.md) statement missing) is signaled by a warning.

### Running the next iteration
<a name="running_the_next_iteration_ELTPARAGRAPHE000138"></a>

To directly run the next iteration **without ending the code of the current iteration**, use the [CONTINUE](../Motscles/1510003.md) statement:


```txt
WHILE <Condition>
	...
	IF <Condition> THEN CONTINUE  // Go back to the WHILE keyword
	...
END
```

<a name="NOTE0_5"></a>




### Composite condition
<a name="composite_condition_ELTPARAGRAPHE000151"></a>

The **AND** and **OR** keywords are used to perform logical operations and to create composite conditions.

For example:


```wl
WHILE Price < 100 AND ProductType = "AA"
	NumProduct ++       // Number of products whose price is less than 
							 // 100 and whose type is "AA"
END

WHILE Price > 100 OR Price < 500
	 NumProduct ++  // Number of products whose price is included between €100 and €500
END
```


The conditions made of **AND** and **OR** are entirely evaluated.

For example:


```wl
A1 > 10 AND B1 < 20
```
Even if the first condition (A1 &gt; 10) is false, the second condition (B1 &lt; 20) will be checked.

**Optimizing the evaluation of composite conditions:** Use the **_AND_** and **_OR_** keywords. If the first condition is false (A1 &gt; 10 in our example), the second condition (B1 &lt; 20 in our example) will not be checked.
