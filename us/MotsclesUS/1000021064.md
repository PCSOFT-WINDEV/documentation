The **SecurePassword** type is a structured type used to obtain a secure, hashed and salted password. This type of variable can be used: 

- for 3-tier applications that handle items of type Password.  

- to store a secure password (hashed and salted) in a binary memo or in an XML file.

## Example


```wl
oSP is SecurePassword
oSP.Hash = MDPS_SHA2_256
oSP.IterationCount = 10000
oSP.Size = 256
oSP = "hello"
```

## Syntax

### Declaring and initializing a secure password

`<Password name> is SecurePassword
`
---

**`<Password name>: ()`**

Name of the SecurePassword variable to be declared.

The following properties can be used to handle a **SecurePassword** variable: 


| Property name | Type | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Age | Duration | Time elapsed since the password was last changed. |
| Content | Character string | Password. |
| Derivation | Integer constant | Key derivation function used to hash the password: <br><br>- *SP_PBKDF2*: Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2) is used. <br><br><br><br><br>PBKDF2 is a key derivation function that takes the following parameters: <br><br>- the password, <br><br>- a hash algorithm (SHA256, SHA512, etc.),<br><br>- a salt (randomly generated). Salts are used to prevent rainbow table attacks.<br><br>- a number of iterations. This number of iterations increases the time it takes to generate/compare a password and prevents attackers from testing millions of passwords in a short time. Thus, the time it would take to generate/compare a password is so long that it becomes impossible to try many combinations.<br><br><br> |
| Hash | Integer constant | Salting algorithm: <br><br>- SP_SHA2_256: Secure Hash Algorithm 256 (SHA-256) is used.<br><br>- SP_SHA2_512: Secure Hash Algorithm 512 (SHA-512) is used.<br><br>- SP_SHA3_256: Secure Hash Algorithm 3-256 (SHA-3 256) is used.<br><br>- SP_SHA3_512: Secure Hash Algorithm 3-512 (SHA-3 512) is used. <br><br><br> |
| IterationCount | Integer | Number of iterations of the hash algorithm used. It is recommended to set a value between 10,000 and 30,000 |
| Length | Integer | Hash output length (in bits). The key must be a multiple of 8, greater than 160 bits and less than 2048 bits. It is recommended to use a 256 or 512-bit key. |
