The **RETURN** statement is used to exit a statement block and the current process (or procedure).

The **RETURN** statement can be used in:

- A procedure,

- A [FOR](../Motscles/1510001.md) loop, 

- A [FOR EACH](../Motscles/1510013.md) loop, 

- A [LOOP](../Motscles/1510004.md) loop, 

- A [WHILE](../Motscles/1510010.md) loop.




In a procedure, you also have the ability to assign a value to the RETURN keyword. This value can be re-read at any time. This value will be automatically returned when exiting the procedure (standard exit from the procedure or exit from the procedure via the RETURN keyword).

## Syntax

### Procedure

`PROCEDURE <Procedure name> ([<Parameter>])
   IF <Condition> THEN RETURN
   ...
   END`
---


<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### FOR statement

`FOR <Control variable> = <Initial value> TO <Final value> [STEP <x>]
   IF <Condition> THEN RETURN
END`
---


<a name="SYNTAX3"></a>

### FOR EACH statement

`FOR EACH <File> ON <Key item>
   IF <Condition> THEN RETURN
END`
---


<a name="SYNTAX4"></a>

### LOOP statement

`LOOP
   ...
   IF <Condition> THEN RETURN
   ...
END`
---


<a name="SYNTAX5"></a>

### WHILE statement

`WHILE <Condition 1>
   ...
   IF <Condition> THEN RETURN
   ...
END`
---

The following operations are performed if &lt;Condition&gt; is True:

- Exit the statement block.

- Exit the current process (or procedure).

## Remarks




### Other statements used to exit a loop or a procedure
<a name="other_statements_used_exit_loop_procedure_ELTPARAGRAPHE000107"></a>



The [BREAK](../Motscles/1510012.md) statement exits the loop and executes the rest of the current process (or procedure).

[Close](../WDLang1/3038018.md) is used to exit the loop (or procedure) and close the current window.


### Using the RETURN keyword to return a value
<a name="using_the_return_keyword_return_value_ELTPARAGRAPHE000134"></a>

In a procedure, you also have the ability to assign the return value before the actual exit from the procedure. For example: 


```wl
...
RETURN = fReadLine(nFile)
fClose(nFile)
```


You also have the ability to re-read the value assigned by RETURN so that there is no need to declare a local variable to contain the result. For example: 


```wl
IF RETURN = 1 THEN...
```


The value assigned to RETURN will be returned to the calling process: 

- at the end of procedure

- when using the RETURN keyword to exit the process (equivalent to the [RETURN](../Motscles/1510007.md) statement).
