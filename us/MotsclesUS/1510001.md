<a name="description"></a>
The statement block is repeated while a control variable is modified and compared to a limit value (before each beginning of statement block).

The statement block is run for each one of the values successively taken by the control variable. The initial value is assigned to the control variable during the first entry in the **FOR** statement.

An optimized syntax is available: this syntax prevents the end value and/or the step value from being re-evaluated at each iteration (useful for a loop on the number of table rows for example).

## Example


```wl
FOR Index = 1 TO 10
	MyArray[Index] = MyVariable + 10
END
```


<a name="Example2"></a>



```wl
FOR Index = 10 TO 1 STEP -1
	MyArray[Index] = MyVariable + 10
END
```


<a name="Example3"></a>



```wl
FOR Index = 1 TO 5
	Trace(Index)
END
Info(Index)	   // Index is set to 6
```


<a name="Example4"></a>



```wl
// Optimized syntax
//Loop through rows in a Table control. 
// The number of rows is calculated once only
FOR Index = 1_TO_TABLE_MyTable.Count
	COL_MyCol[Index].Color = iDarkGreen
END
```

## Syntax

`FOR <Control variable> = <Initial value> TO <Final value> [STEP <x>]
...
END
`
---

**`<FOR>: ()`**

Marks the beginning of the statement block.

**`<Control variable>: ()`**

Scalar simple variable (integer or real).

There is no need to declare this variable. Indeed, this variable is automatically declared.

**`<Initial value>: ()`**

Initial value of control variable (integer or real).

**`<Final value>: ()`**

Final value of control variable (integer or real).

**`<STEP>: ()`**

Increment step (optional) of control variable (1 by default).

**`<x>: ()`**

Optional value of increment step (same type as the type of control variable).

**`<END>: ()`**

Marks the end of the statement block.  


<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Other possible syntaxes

`FOR <Control variable> = <Initial value> _TO_ <Final value> [STEP <x>]
...
END
 
FOR <Control variable> = <Initial value> _TO_ <Final value> [_STEP_ <x>]
...
END
 
FOR <Control variable> = <Initial value> TO <Final value> [_STEP_ <x>]
...
END
`
---

**`<_TO_>: ()`**

Signals that the final value must be evaluated once only

**`<_STEP_>: ()`**

Signals that the increment step must be evaluated once only.

## Remarks




### Equivalent syntax
<a name="equivalent_syntax_ELTPARAGRAPHE000105"></a>

You also have the ability to use the following syntax:


```txt
FOR <Control variable> = <Initial value> TO <Final value> [STEP <x>]; ... ; END
```


The semicolon is used to separate the different lines.
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>




### Code to run
<a name="code_run_ELTPARAGRAPHE000117"></a>

The code to run is placed between the **FOR** and **END** statements.
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>




### Increment step
<a name="increment_step_ELTPARAGRAPHE000125"></a>

The increment step of **FOR** statement must be constant. A warning is displayed during the project compilation if the increment step is likely to change at each iteration.
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>




### Exiting from a FOR loop
<a name="exiting_from_for_loop_ELTPARAGRAPHE000133"></a>

Several statements are available:

- [RETURN](../Motscles/1510009.md): Exit from the **FOR** loop and exit from the current process (or procedure).

- [RETURN](../Motscles/1510007.md): Return a status report to the calling process. Exit from the **FOR** loop and exit from the current process (or procedure).

- [BREAK](../Motscles/1510012.md): Exit from the **FOR** loop and run the rest of the current process.




[Close](../WDLang1/3038018.md) is used to exit from the **FOR** loop and to close the current window.

**Caution**: [RETURN](../Motscles/1510009.md) and [RETURN](../Motscles/1510007.md) cannot be used in the same process.
<a name="NOTE0_5"></a>




### Running the next iteration
<a name="running_the_next_iteration_ELTPARAGRAPHE000163"></a>

To directly run the next iteration **without ending the code of the current iteration**, use the [Continue](../Motscles/1510003.md) statement:


```txt
FOR <Control variable> = <Initial value> TO <Final value> [STEP <x>]
	...
	IF <Condition> THEN CONTINUE		   // Return to the FOR keyword
	...
END
```


In this case, the control variable is automatically incremented.
