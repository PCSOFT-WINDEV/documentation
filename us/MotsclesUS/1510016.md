**FOR EACH** is used to perform different types of browse on the arrays:

- Browsing the array elements,

- Browsing the values of array elements. 




**Remark**: The **FOR ALL, FOR EACH** statements are accepted. The **FOR EACH** statement will be used in this documentation but it can be replaced with **FOR ALL**.

The FOR EACH statement can also be used to browse the .Net objects that implement the IEnumerable interface.

## Example


```wl
// Browse the elements found in an array of reals and calculate the sum
// Fill the array
ArrCalc is array of 3 reals
ArrCalc[1] = 12.5
ArrCalc[2] = 10
ArrCalc[3] = 7.5
// Calculate the sum
TotalSum is real
FOR EACH AnElement OF ArrCalc
	TotalSum += AnElement
END
```

```wl
// Browse the arrCustomers array and only process the customers 
// whose city is equal to "MONTPELLIER".

stCustomer is structure
	LastName is string
	FirstName is string
	City is string
END

arrCustomers is array of stCustomer

FOR EACH stACustomer of arrCustomers WHERE City = "MONTPELLIER"
	// Process
END
```

## Syntax

### Browsing the array elements

`FOR EACH [ELEMENT] <Variable> [, <Key> [, <Counter>]] OF <Array> [WHERE <Condition>] [<Direction>]
     ...
END
`
---

**`<FOR EACH [ELEMENT]>: ()`**

Marks the beginning of the statement block. The ELEMENT keyword is optional.

**`<Variable>: ()`**

Variable whose type is identical to the type of the array elements. For the arrays of classes, the variable must be a Dynamic Class variable. There is no need to declare this variable.

**`<Key>: ()`**

Key of element browsed. This key depends on the element browsed:

- One-dimensional array: subscript of the element in the array.

- Two-dimensional array (or n-dimensional array): counter that starts from 1




There is no need to declare this variable.

**`<Counter>: ()`**

Integer variable containing the number of iterations. There is no need to declare this variable.

**`<Array>: ()`**

Array to browse.

**`<Condition>: ()`**

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Condition to indicate to filter the browse. Only the array elements corresponding to the filter will be browsed.

**`<Direction>: ()`**

Optional indicator for the iteration direction:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *FromBeginning*<br>(default value) | Browse the array from the first element to the last one. |
| *FromEnd* | Browse the array from the last element to the first one. |

### Browsing the values of array elements

`FOR EACH [ELEMENT] <Value> OF <Array> [WHERE <Condition>] [<Direction>]
     ...
END
`
---

**`<FOR EACH ELEMENT>: ()`**

Marks the beginning of the statement block. The ELEMENT keyword is optional.

**`<Value>: ()`**

Variable whose type is compatible with the array elements.  There is no need to declare this variable.

**`<Array>: ()`**

Array to browse.

**`<Condition>: ()`**

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Condition to indicate to filter the browse. Only the array elements corresponding to the filter will be browsed.

**`<Direction>: ()`**

Optional indicator for the iteration direction:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *FromBeginning*<br>(default value) | Browse the array from the first element to the last one. |
| *FromEnd* | Browse the array from the last element to the first one. |

## Remarks




### Syntax 1: Browsing the array elements
<a name="syntax_1_browsing_the_array_elements_ELTPARAGRAPHE000137"></a>

For each iteration, &lt;Variable&gt; directly refers to the current element in the array. If the value of &lt;Variable&gt; is modified, the current element in the array is modified.

When exiting from the loop (standard exit or via the BREAK statement), the value of the last element read is assigned to &lt;Variable&gt; but &lt;Variable&gt; does not directly refer to the array element anymore.

All types of arrays are available: automatic, fixed, dynamic.

The arrays can have several dimensions.

The behavior is undefined if the number of elements is modified in the browse loop.

### Syntax 2: Browsing the values of array elements
<a name="syntax_2_browsing_the_values_array_elements_ELTPARAGRAPHE000153"></a>

For each iteration, the value of the element browsed is assigned to the &lt;Value&gt; variable. If the value of &lt;Value&gt; is modified, the current element in the array is not modified.

All types of arrays are available: automatic, fixed, dynamic.

The arrays can have several dimensions.

The behavior is undefined if the number of elements is modified in the browse loop.
