## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000064"></a>
WDADMINEXE is used to deploy network applications in push via the "Push" tab. The setup while taking the Push into account is used to deploy an application on all the client computers of a network from a single management computer. 

This setup mode is an option of the setup in local network with automatic update (Live Update).

### Deploying in Push on the client computers
<a name="deploying_push_the_client_computers_ELTPARAGRAPHE000106"></a>

To deploy in push on the client computers:

1. Start WDAdminExe (see above).

2. Display the "Push" tab of the main window:

3. In "List of computers" (1), enter the username and the password of a Windows account with sufficient rights to enumerate the network computers.
	**Remarks**:

	- In an Active Directory, the username must have one of the following formats: DOMAIN\\USER and/or USER@DOMAIN.

	- This account does not have to be an administrator.

	- You have the ability to store the connection information. If this option is used, it is important not to store the password of an administrator.

	- You also have the ability to load a list of computers from a text file. The text file can contain: 

		- computer names or IP addresses.

		- comments in "// Comment" format. 


Each line must contain a name (or IP address) and a comment. For example: 
			
		```txt
		VIB //Vincent's computer
		FP //Florence's computer
		```


4. Click "List the computers" to validate the connection information and to start enumerating the client computers.
	**Caution**: depending on the LDAP policies defined in Active Directory, the import can be limited to 1,000 users. In this case, to remove this limitation, it is necessary to modify the LDAP MaxPageSize parameter. For more details, see [https://support.microsoft.com/kb/315071](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/315071). 

5. The criteria (2) and the list of groups (3) can be used to filter the computers to display. The list of groups is available on an Active Directory domain only.

6. The table of computers (4) displays: 

	- the client computers found, 

	- the comment if text file is found.

	- the version number of the application if it is already installed, 

	- the result of the previous Push setups.




7. Select the client computers on which the application must be deployed in Push mode.

8. Click "Start the PUSH setup..." to start the setup.
	The window for starting the setup is displayed: 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WDAdminExe_2%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.gif&type=thumb)


9. If several versions of the application are found in the reference setup, select the version that must be deployed in Push (1).

10. The summary (2) displays the list of target computers for the setup. Some computers can be deleted from this list via the popup menu.

11. You can use a Windows account other than the one that was used to enumerate the computers if necessary (3).

12. You can program the Push setup so that it is performed thereafter (4). This option allows you to automatically update a set of client computers outside the working hours for example.

13. The validation of this window starts the Push setups. The progress can be monitored in the table of computers of the main window of WDADMINEXE.




**Remark**: An "Advanced" button is used to configure the timeout for the Push setups. If several setups fail with timeout errors, you may have to adjust this parameter.


### Services required on the target computers

**Remark**: Depending on the Windows versions used, the names of these services may change in the control panel.

The following services must be started on the target computers of the setup in Push mode:

- File share ("lanmanserver" service)

- Access to the remote registry ("RemoteRegistry" service)




Furthermore, the administrative share (ADMIN$) must exist. This share can be viewed in the management tool named "Computer management", in "System tools .. Shared folders .. Shares".


### Services required on the computer that performs the Push setup
