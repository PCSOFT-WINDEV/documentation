## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000215"></a>
The **Feedback** component is a component provided with WINDEV. This component allows the end users of your applications to send:

- suggestions about the application.

- problems that occurred on the application.

- business rules.




The different elements are received via the Control centers.

If the end user is not connected to the same network, the elements are sent by email. The user is identified by the name specified in the email.

If the user is connected to the same network (which means if he can access the data of Control Centers via network or ADSL), the elements sent are automatically added to the data of Control Centers.

**Remark**: If your application uses the automatic menu ("?"), the Feedback component is automatically included in your application when you select "Send a suggestion, a problem or a business rule".

**Multilingual application**: The Feedback component is available in French and in English. For the other languages, the wizards of the component will be displayed in English by default. However, the different messages found in the Feedback component can be translated. For more details, see [Translating the components](../Editeurs/2014014.md).

The **Feedback** component, if it is used by the application, will be automatically called from the error window of WLanguage and it will allow to transmit a dump file to the current application.

## Sending a suggestion, a problem or a business rule with the Feedback component

### Sending a suggestion, a problem or a business rule with the Feedback component
<a name="sending_suggestion_problem_business_rule_with_the_feedback_component_ELTPARAGRAPHE000039"></a>

The Feedback component allows the end user can easily send various information. To do so:

1. Start the Feedback component wizard:

	- via the automatic menu ("? .. Send a suggestion, a problem or a business rule").

	- via an option of your application that manages the Feedback component.




2. In the wizard, choose the type of request to perform: 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=MesIncidents2.gif&type=thumb)


3. Enter the personal details (optional).

4. indicate the information regarding the problem, the suggestion or the business rule.

5. Insert (if necessary) a screenshot (with comments).




A summary of the request is displayed. This request can be saved and/or printed.

During the validation, the request is directly sent:

- If the user is in offline mode (the database of Control Centers is not accessible), the request is sent by email.

- If the user is in online mode (the database of Control Centers if accessible via network or Internet/ADSL), the request is directly saved in the files of Control Centers.

### Showing the outgoing requests
<a name="showing_the_outgoing_requests_ELTPARAGRAPHE000063"></a>

If the automatic menu was included in the WINDEV application, the user can easily see the requests already sent via "? .. Show the outgoing requests".

If the user is in offline mode, the identifier used to send the request (name specified in the email) is used.

If the user is in online mode, the identifier used to send the request (name specified in the wizard) is used.

## Configuring the Feedback component
<a name="configuring_the_feedback_component_ELTTEXTE000269"></a>


### If the users of the application are in offline mode
<a name="the_users_the_application_are_offline_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000076"></a>

If the Feedback component was included via the automatic menu ("?"), you have the ability to specify the email address used to send the suggestions:

- in the wizard for creating/modifying the automatic menu.

- in the code of the option of automatic menu.

- when creating the executable.




**Tip**: specify an email address, this address will be automatically used if the users are not connected (network down, ...).

### If the application users are in online mode
<a name="the_application_users_are_online_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000089"></a>

- **Database of Control Centers in HFSQL Classic mode**: No specific configuration is required.

- **Database of Control Centers in HFSQL Client/Server mode**: If the Feedback component was included via the automatic menu ("?"), the user who will be taken into account for the connection to the database is the current user. We advise you to:

	- create a "Guest" contributor in the Project Monitoring Center (with no administrator rights). The suggestions, business rules (for instance) will be sent via this user's connection.

	- use the parameters of the "Guest" contributor in the code of "? .. Send suggestions, ...".

		1. Display the window that uses the automatic menu. On the "Window" tab, in the "Bars and menus" group, expand "Main menu" and select "Open the '?' menu".

		2. Edit the code of "Send a suggestion, an incident, a business rule" option.

		3. Modify the line of code used to specify the path of the data files. Use the following line of code:
						
			```wl
			pFeedback.Configure(fbPathCCData, ...
					"hfcs://<user>:<password>@<server>:<port>/<database>")
			```

						In this code:

			- &lt;user&gt;: Name of a user of the Control Center.

			- &lt;password&gt;: Password associated with the user.

			- &lt;server&gt;: IP address or name of the server where the database of Control Centers is installed.

			- &lt;port&gt;: Server port.

			- &lt;database&gt;: Name of the HFSQL Client/Server database corresponding to the files of Control Centers.
										Remark: if you update the automatic menu of your application, this line of code will be automatically updated with the name of the current developer.
										If the Feedback component was included independently of the automatic menu ("?"), see the documentation about the component.
