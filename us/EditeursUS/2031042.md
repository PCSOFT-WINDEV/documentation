## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000125"></a>
The RAD (Rapid Application Development) is a technology used to easily create a full application (or site).

The RAD is based on preset programming patterns used to generate the requested application. You also have the ability to create your own "patterns" to generate a custom application automatically: you choose the code to generate as well as the positioning of controls.

The RAD can be started as follows: on the "Project" tab, in the "Generation" group, click "Full Application RAD". Once the pattern is chosen, simply follow the different steps of the wizard.

The following RAD patterns are proposed by default:

- **Simple RAD**:
	This pattern is used to generate a full application. This application contains forms, tables and loopers. The code used is as simple as possible. Any style book can be applied.

- **Antakara pattern**:
	This pattern is used to create an application that proposes some advanced features such as a task list, a calendar, … This application also proposes a menu made of animated images.

- **Pure pattern**:
	This pattern is used to create an application with an interface suitable for the large screens.

- **Jet'Tames pattern**:
	This pattern is used to create an application that proposes a specific feature for sending emails. The menu of the application uses a carousel of images.

- **Compatible 11 RAD pattern**:
	This pattern is used to generate an application corresponding to the applications generated by the version 11.
	Caution: This type of RAD is not available in 64 bits.
