## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000350"></a>
By testing the project you can simulate how the application will run when launched by the user (executable, package, etc.). This allows you to test the entire application, even if it is still being developed.

**Overview of the different types of tests**
Several types of project tests are available in WINDEV Mobile:

- **Test in a simulator** (Test on the development computer): 
	This test simulates a mobile device on the development computer. No connection to a mobile device is required during this test. You can use the debugger. However, this test being run on a PC and not on the real device, the application may behave differently in some ways. 

- ![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) **Direct test on the device connected to the development computer**. 
	In this case, the application file that corresponds to the project is created, copied directly to the device and executed. When running the program on the device, the device can be disconnected from the PC. The debugger is available in Android and iOS.

## Test in the simulator
<a name="test_the_simulator_ELTTEXTE000374"></a>
To test the current project on the development computer (in simulation mode): 

1. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Ico_GO_Projet_WB_bl.GIF)
 in the quick access buttons (or press Ctrl + F9).

2. If the first project window was not defined, a window is displayed, allowing you to select the first project window. 
	If the application is intended to be used on phones and tablets, two windows are displayed: 

	- a window used to define the first project window on the phones. 

	- a window used to define the first project window on the tablets. 




3. Validate (if necessary) the warning window for the simulator mode. 

4. The editor is automatically minimized and the project is run.




**Remarks**:

- The result of some features depends on the platform used (operating system, format of character strings, ...). Differences may occur when running the test in simulation mode and when running the application test on the device corresponding to the relevant platform. 

- Debugging in the simulator: The application can be debugged in the simulator. This mode is used to quickly debug a new function or to check an algorithm but it presents differences of behavior. For example: 

	- path of files: the paths used are the ones of Windows. 

	- format of character strings. 

	- functions specific to the mobiles not available.

## Test in the emulator
<a name="test_the_emulator_ELTTEXTE000398"></a>
![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) To test the current project in the emulator: 

1. Expand ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Ico_GO_Projet_WB_bl.GIF)
 in the quick access buttons and select the corresponding option: "Test project (xxx emulator)". 

2. The application is automatically generated. 

3. A window allows you to select the emulator or the device onto which the application will be copied and run. This window is used to create an emulator if necessary. 

4. Select the desired emulator and validate. 

5. The emulator and the application start. 




**Android emulator**
The Android emulator is supplied with the Android SDK. To use an emulator, you must first create it in Android Studio (refer to the Android Studio documentation for more details). If the emulator has been created, it will automatically appear in the list of available devices for testing via the "GO" option. 

**Remarks**: 

- The emulator may take a long time to start. It is recommended not to close the emulator between 2 project tests. 

- The debugger is not attached to the application. The breakpoints are ignored.

- This type of test does not take the speed of the phone into account. The test takes the speed of the development computer into account. 

- Some WLanguage functions are not available in the emulator. The documentation of the different functions indicates whether the function can be used in the emulator. The functions fail when they are not available.




**iOS emulator (Xcode)**

- iOS 14 widget: When testing from Xcode, a widget mode is forced by default. If necessary, you change the configuration in Xcode (refer to the Xcode documentation).

### Direct test on the device connected to the development computer
<a name="direct_test_the_device_connected_the_development_computer_ELTPARAGRAPHE000211"></a>

To test the current application on the device connected to the development computer: 

1. Expand ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Ico_GO_Projet_WB_bl.GIF)
 in the quick access buttons. 

2. Select: 

	- ![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) "Test application on PC/mobile device".




3. If the application has not been generated, the application generation wizard will automatically start.

4. The application is copied onto the device and it is run.

## Stopping the project test
<a name="stopping_the_project_test_ELTTEXTE000455"></a>


### Stopping the test of a project in simulator mode
<a name="stopping_the_test_project_simulator_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000253"></a>

In simulator mode, several methods can be used to stop the test:

- **1st method**: Close the application whose test is currently run (via an option used to close the application for example). WINDEV or WINDEV Mobile displays the editor that was open when the test was started.

- **2nd method**: Close the application test window.

- **3rd method**: Go back to the editor via the taskbar (or Alt + Tab) and stop the test. WINDEV or WINDEV Mobile displays the editor that was open when the test was started.





### Stopping the test of a project in the emulator
<a name="stopping_the_test_project_the_emulator_ELTPARAGRAPHE000262"></a>

To stop the test of a project in the emulator, all you have to do is close the application in the emulator. 

You also have the ability to close the emulator. However, the emulator taking quite a long time to be started, we advise you to leave it opened if several tests must be run. 


### Stopping the test of a project on the mobile device
<a name="stopping_the_test_project_the_mobile_device_ELTPARAGRAPHE000269"></a>

During the direct test on the device, all you have to do is stop the application on the device.

## Remarks

### Directory of data files used for test
<a name="directory_data_files_used_for_test_ELTPARAGRAPHE000278"></a>

To configure the data files used when running the site test in the editor:

1. Open the project description: on the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, click "Description".

2. In the "File" tab, select the location of the test files:

	- Current directory: The data files will be in the project EXE subdirectory.

	- Specific directory: The data files will be found in the specified directory.







Reminder: When testing the application, the data files used are those found on the development computer. The file system also corresponds to the Windows system for PC. To avoid any problems when the application is used in a real-case scenario, use [InTestMode](../WDLang1/3013011.md) to differentiate between the access to the data files in test mode and at runtime.
