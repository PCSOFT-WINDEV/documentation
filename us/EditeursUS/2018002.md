	From version <B>18</B>, the User Groupware evolves. This help page corresponds to the User Groupware kept for backward compatibility. To get the help regarding the new version of the User Groupware, see [User Groupware](../Editeurs/1000021152.md).

## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000192"></a>
Two categories of data files are managed:

- **the data files used to identify the users**. These data files can be common to several applications. 
	By default, these data files are created in a subdirectory of your project (EXE\\GPW_&lt;Project name&gt; directory). These files are used to run the test of your application. 
	To run the test of your application, you can specify a different directory or use the directory containing the application data (this option is recommended for the tests run in Windows Vista with the UAC enabled). 

- **the data files used to manage the rights granted to the users on the different windows or pages found in the application**. These files are specific to the application. 
	By default, these data files are created in a subdirectory of your project (EXE\\GPW_&lt;Project name&gt; directory). These files are used to run the test of your application.

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) **Remark**: When creating the executable (multi-instance executable), you have the ability define the location of the files of user groupware. For more details, see [Running the test of the user groupware and using it](../Editeurs/2018009.md).

## The different files
<a name="the_different_files_ELTTEXTE000216"></a>


### Data files used to identify the users
<a name="data_files_used_identify_the_users_ELTPARAGRAPHE000042"></a>

These files can be common to several applications:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| ***GPWUser*** | File of users. Contains all the characteristics of the users (login, last name, first name, password, ...) |
| ***GPWUserConfiguration*** | File of groups of users. |
| ***GPWConnectionHistory*** | File containing the history of connections. This file is found only if the history of connections was requested. |

**Where are these files created?**

- By default, these data files (HyperFileSQL Classic mode) are created in a subdirectory of your project (EXE\\GPW_<:Project Name&gt; directory). When including the User Groupware, a different directory can be specified to run the tests of your application. You have the ability to use HyperFileSQL Client/Server data files. For more details, see [Groupware files in HyperFileSQL Client/Server format](../Editeurs/2018011.md).
	![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) When creating the executable, a specific directory can be specified for these common data files.

- When creating the setup program, you can allow users to configure the location of these files ("Additional modules" plane). In this case, the location of the files of user groupware will be stored in the executable and it will be updated when installing the executable. Therefore, a common directory can be selected for several applications that manage the user groupware.

- If "Manual start" was selected, [gpwOpen](../WDLang6/3041002.md) is used to start the login window or page of the User Groupware as well as customize the directory of the data files found in the User Groupware. Regardless of the directories specified when creating and installing the application, this directory will be taken into account if it is specified.




**Remark**: if no specific setting is performed, the User data files (HyperFileSQL Classic) will be created in a subdirectory of the setup directory of executable (or library for a WEBDEV site) named \\GPW_&lt;Project Name&gt;

For more details:

- about the structure of these files, see [Structure of files of user groupware](../Editeurs/2018005.md)

- about the management of data files in a Client/Server application, see [User Groupware and Client/Server](../Editeurs/2018011.md).

### Data files used to manage the rights
<a name="data_files_used_manage_the_rights_ELTPARAGRAPHE000090"></a>

These files are specific to the application. They cannot be shared with another application.


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| ***GPWConfiguration*** | File containing the description of the different available configurations. Each configuration is associated with a group of users. |
| ***GPWElementConfiguration*** | Status of each application element for each configuration. For example, enables you to store whether the "Statistics menu" must be grayed for the "Assistant" user. |
| ***GPWElement*** | File containing the different elements of the application to configure (window or page controls, menu options, ...) |

**Where are these files created?**

- By default, these data files (HyperFileSQL Classic mode) are created in a subdirectory of your project (EXE\\GPW_<:Project Name&gt; directory). You have the ability to use HyperFileSQL Client/Server data files. For more details, see [Groupware files in HyperFileSQL Client/Server format](../Editeurs/2018011.md).

- When creating the setup program, you can allow users to configure the location of these files ("Additional modules" plane). You have the ability to select a specific directory for the rights files of the application.

- If "Manual run" is selected, [gpwOpen](../WDLang6/3041002.md) is used to start the login window or page of the User Groupware and to customize the directory of data files for the User Groupware. Regardless of the directories specified when creating and installing the application, this directory will be taken into account if it is specified.




**Remark**: if no specific setting is performed, the data files of rights (HyperFileSQL Classic) will be created in a subdirectory of the setup directory of executable (or library for a WEBDEV site) named \\GPW_&lt;Project Name&gt;

For more details:

- about the structure of these files, see [Structure of files of user groupware](../Editeurs/2018005.md)

### Password of data files
<a name="password_data_files_ELTPARAGRAPHE000134"></a>

By default, the data files found in the User Groupware have a specific password. This password is: ***"PCSGPW2001***".

To change this password:

1. Display the configuration window of the user groupware ("Workshop .. Configure the user groupware").

2. In the "Files" tab, enter the new password. The characters typed are displayed as stars.




**Caution**: If the groupware files already exist, their password is not modified. This modification can only be performed before the data files are created.

**Remark**: This password is used when the files are re-indexed or when the files are opened by WDMAP.
