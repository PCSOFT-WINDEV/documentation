## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000192"></a>
The query editor allows you to automatically create queries on the data files. Creating a query is simple and intuitive. The query is automatically generated (in optimized SQL code) and can be tested immediately.

No programming hassle: windows, pages, tables, combo boxes and reports found in your project can be based on queries.

## Differences between the standard query editor (included in WINDEV) and the user version of the query editor
<a name="differences_between_the_standard_query_editor_included_windev_and_the_user_version_the_query_editor_ELTTEXTE000216"></a>
Two versions of the query editor are available:

- **the standard query editor included in the product.**
	This version is supplied with WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile. This version can only be used when developing a WINDEV or WINDEV Mobile application, or a WEBDEV site.

- **the user version of query editor** (also called **Reports & Queries**). This editor is supplied with WINDEV only.
	This version is independent of WINDEV and it can be used by the end users.
	Some features of query editor are not available in this version. The ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=er.png)
 icon indicates the differences between Reports & Queries and the standard query editor.

### Standard query editor
<a name="standard_query_editor_ELTPARAGRAPHE000036"></a>

The standard query editor allows you to create queries and to run these queries from the editor or from an application developed with WINDEV, WINDEV Mobile or WEBDEV.

The dongle of WINDEV, WINDEV Mobile or WEBDEV is required to use the query editor. It must be plugged into the parallel port of your computer when using the editor.

However, no dongle is required by the end user (to run a query from a WINDEV, WINDEV Mobile or WEBDEV application).

Several examples are supplied with the integrated query editor. In these examples, you will discover the main queries that can be used in your applications.
To find out the list of examples for using reports: 

- Display the home page (Ctrl + <).

- Type the "Report" keyword.

- The list of examples for using reports is displayed.




Check these examples, they will teach you a lot and you will be able to use them when you create your own queries!

### User version of query editor (Reports & Queries - WINDEV only)
<a name="user_version_query_editor_reports_queries_windev_only_ELTPARAGRAPHE000059"></a>

Reports & Queries allows you to create and run queries from the editor (WINDEV is not required).

The created queries can be run from the query editor or from a WINDEV application (if this application supports the queries created by Reports & Queries).

No dongle is required to use Reports & Queries.

Some operations are required to create new queries or to modify the existing queries with Reports & Queries. For more details, see [Distributing Reports & Queries](../Presentation/3088002.md).
