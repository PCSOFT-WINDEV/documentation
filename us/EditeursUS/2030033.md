## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000126"></a>
The project includes windows, reports, queries, help files, sets of procedures, ...

When creating an element in a project, this element is automatically included in the list of elements for the current project. The dependencies of this element (images, ...) are also automatically included in the list of project elements.

The elements found in the list of project elements will be automatically proposed for being included in the library of the application (if the library is created).

## How to?
<a name="how_ELTTEXTE000150"></a>
**To display the list of elements of a project**, go to the "Project" tab, "Project" group, expand "List of elements" and select "List of project elements".

This option is used to:

- **Add elements belonging to other projects**: 
	All types of files can be added to the list of project elements: images, text files, etc, ...
	Remark: The corresponding files and their dependencies will be part of the project but the corresponding files will not be moved into the directory of your project.

- **Delete elements from your project**:
	Remark: The corresponding files and their dependencies will not be part of the project anymore but the corresponding files will not be physically deleted.

- **Regenerate the list of elements found in your project**:
	This option allows you to rebuild the list of project elements from the elements found in the specified directory. This option is used when exporting WINDEV elements to the directory of a second project for instance. To take the new elements into account in the second project, all you have to do is regenerate the list of elements.

- **Relocate the elements**: 
	This option is used to modify the directory of the physical file corresponding to the selected element.

### Tips: Adding elements to a library
<a name="tips_adding_elements_library_ELTPARAGRAPHE000058"></a>

To add elements to a library, we advise you to add these elements to the list of project elements. Therefore, to use a specific image in one or more windows of your project through programming, this image must be included in the list of project elements (there is no need to include it in a window).

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) **Including elements in the executable: "Other" in the "Project explorer" pane**
Files (HFSQL data files, images, sounds, etc.) can be included directly in the generated executable. This allows you to use resources that must not be visible on the disk of the end user. 

To do so, simply include these resources in the project via the "Other" folder, in the "Project explorer" pane. 
The following features are used to simplify the operations performed on the "Other" folder: 

- The "Drag and Drop" of elements to include in the "Other" folder can be performed from the Windows file explorer. 

- A popup menu on the "Other" menu is used to add or delete elements. 

- An "Other" folder is also available in each internal component, allowing you to include elements in the shared internal components. 

- The function used to perform a search in the project also browses the "Other" folder of the project.
