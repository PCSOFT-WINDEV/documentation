## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000185"></a>
The help editor allows you to easily create a multilingual help system. All the elements found in the help system can:

- be translated in the help editor directly.

- be extracted for translation and then reintegrated via WDMSG (optional tool for extracting and reintegrating messages of a WINDEV application).




As the help compiler does not allow you to create a multilingual help system, you will have to create a help file for each language supported by your help system.

## How to?
<a name="how_ELTTEXTE000209"></a>


### Defining the languages supported by the help system
<a name="defining_the_languages_supported_the_help_system_ELTPARAGRAPHE000023"></a>

By default, the help system supports the same languages as the project. 

To add or remove languages:

1. Open the help system description window: 

	- On the "Modification" tab, in the "Help system" group, click "Description". 

	- Go to the "Languages" tab.




2. Select the languages that will be supported by your help system.

The "Synchronize with the project" option automatically takes into account all the languages supported by the project.

### Translating the elements in the help system
<a name="translating_the_elements_the_help_system_ELTPARAGRAPHE000056"></a>

If you do not use WDMSG to simplify the translation of the help elements, each element must be translated in its description window. The elements to be translated are as follows:

- **Title of the help**: this title is displayed in the title bar of the help file. To translate this title into the different languages, open the description of the help system: on the "Modification" tab, in the "Help system" group, click "Description".

- ** Title of the help page**: this title is the one used in the summary of the help file. To translate this title into different languages, right-click the page or summary and select "Page properties".

- **Index keywords**: keywords allow the users to easily find a help page. To translate the different keywords:
	1. Display the index in the editor ("Index" tab of the list of help pages).
	2. Right-click the keyword, select "Keyword properties" and enter the translation.

- **Header and content of the help page**: to translate the header and the content of the help page, simply change the help display language: on the "Modification" tab, in the "Translate" group, expand "Language displayed" and select the desired language. The help page is displayed in the selected language.

### Displaying the help system in the selected language
<a name="displaying_the_help_system_the_selected_language_ELTPARAGRAPHE000096"></a>

By default, the help system is displayed in the editor in the main language of the project.

To display the entire help system in a specific language:

1. On the "Modification" tab, in the "Translate" group, expand "Language displayed".

2. Select the desired language and validate.

3. The entire help system is displayed in the editor in the selected language.

### Compiling and running the test of the help system in a specific language
<a name="compiling_and_running_the_test_the_help_system_specific_language_ELTPARAGRAPHE000121"></a>

When compiling the help system, it will be created in the language displayed in the editor.

To avoid overwriting the help file created by each compilation, WINDEV proposes to manage the physical name of the help file by adding the identifier of the current language.

This option can be defined in the [Compiler options](../Editeurs/2010015.md). The identifier of the language used can correspond to:

- the numeric identifier of the language used (identifier also used by [Nation](../WDLang1/3054014.md)).

- the text identifier of the language used (US for English, etc.)

```
