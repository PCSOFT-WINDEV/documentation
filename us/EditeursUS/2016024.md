## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000261"></a>
Development teams that have design expertise sometime want to be able to create their own skin templates. From version 21, a skin template generator is provided with WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile.

## Principle
<a name="principle_ELTTEXTE000285"></a>
To create a skin template, you must: 

1. [Create the directory containing the sources of skin template](#NOTE3_1). This step is performed via a wizard.  

2. [Customize the images, the window templates and the report templates found in the skin template](#NOTE4_1). 

3. [Generate the custom skin template](#NOTE5_1). This step is performed via a wizard. 




The custom skin template is automatically proposed along with the standard skin template when creating projects or when applying a skin template.

## Step 1: Creating the directory containing the sources of skin template
<a name="step_1_creating_the_directory_containing_the_sources_skin_template_ELTTEXTE000309"></a>
To create the directory corresponding to the skin template: 

1. Start WINDEV or WINDEV Mobile. 

2. On the "Tools" tab, in the "Skin templates" group, click "Skin template generator". 
	Caution: No project must be opened in the editor because several operations are performed by the generator (compilations, synchronization of styles and templates, ...). 

3. The skin template generation wizard starts. 

4. Select "Generate the sources of a new skin template". Go to the next step via the arrow buttons. 

5. Specify the name of skin template. The path of working directory (containing the sources of skin template) is automatically proposed. This path can be modified if necessary. 

6. Go to the next step. The source files of the skin template have been automatically generated in the specified working directory. Several directories are created. These directories contain the images and templates that will be used to generate the final skin template. 




You have the ability to customize the images and the window templates found in the skin template (step 2).
