## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000247"></a>
Several types of links can exist between the data files:

- [parallel](#NOTE2_1).

- [optional](#NOTE3_1).

- [complement](#NOTE4_1).

- [shared](#NOTE5_1).

- [complex](#NOTE6_1).

## Parallel link
<a name="parallel_link_ELTTEXTE000271"></a>




### Definition
<a name="definition_ELTPARAGRAPHE000036"></a>

For a parallel link, **each record** found in a data file ("Product") is linked to **a record** found in another data file ("Info"), and **conversely**.

![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=LiaisonParallele.gif)


To manage a parallel link, the identifier of the "Product" data file is copied into the "Info" data file. This identifier is also a unique key in the "Info" data file.

The "Product" data file is the owner file. The "Info" data file is the member file.

### Remarks
<a name="remarks_ELTPARAGRAPHE000050"></a>

- This type of link is rare because the two data files can be grouped into a single file.

- The parallelism of records in the data file is respected if the following operations are run simultaneously on the two data files:

	- creating a record

	- deleting a record

	- reindexing with compression

## Optional link
<a name="optional_link_ELTTEXTE000301"></a>




### Definition
<a name="definition_ELTPARAGRAPHE000065"></a>

For an optional link, **each record** found in a data file ("Category") is associated **with no record or with a single record** in another data file ("Group"). **Each record** of the other data file ("Group") is associated **with no record or with a single record** in the first data file ("Category").

An optional link is performed by copying the identifier of each data file into the other data file.

## Complement link
<a name="complement_link_ELTTEXTE000325"></a>




### Definition
<a name="definition_ELTPARAGRAPHE000079"></a>

For a complement link, **each record** found in a data file ("Product") is associated **with no record or with a single record** in another data file ("Details"). **Each record** of the other data file ("Details") is **necessarily associated with a record** in the first data file ("Product").

![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Liaisoncomplement.gif)


Complement links are quite common. They are used when a record can have additional optional information.

To manage a complement link, the key of the "Product" data file is copied into the "Details" data file. To ensure the maximum cardinality of 1, it remains a unique key. Since this key is unique, it is not possible to insert more than one record in "Details" for a record in "Product".

The owner file is "Product", the member file is "Details".

<a name="NOTE5_1"></a>


## Shared link
<a name="shared_link_ELTTEXTE000349"></a>




### Definition
<a name="definition_ELTPARAGRAPHE000097"></a>

For a shared link, the **same record** in a data file ("Supplier") can be **shared by several records** in another data file ("Product").

To manage a shared link, the key of the "Supplier" data file is copied into the "Product" data file. It becomes a multiple key to optimize the speed of the integrity check.

The owner file is "Supplier", the member file is "Product".

Depending on the cardinality, we can distinguish between four types of shared links:

- Shared link with a 0,n - 0,1 cardinality

- Shared link with a 0,n - 1,1 cardinality

- Shared link with a 1,n - 0,1 cardinality

- Shared link with a 1,n - 1,1 cardinality



<a name="NOTE5_2"></a>




### Shared link with a 0,N - 0,1 cardinality
<a name="shared_link_with_0n_01_cardinality_ELTPARAGRAPHE000116"></a>

With this type of link:

- an owner may have no member (a supplier does not necessarily have a product).

- a member may have no owner (a product does not necessarily have a supplier).

### Shared link with a 0,N - 1,1 cardinality
<a name="shared_link_with_0n_11_cardinality_ELTPARAGRAPHE000129"></a>

With this type of link:

- an owner may have no member (a supplier may have no product).

- each member has a single owner (each product has a single supplier).

**Remark**: This type of link is quite common. WINDEV allows you to automatically create the windows used to manage the data files linked by a 0,N - 1,1 link.

### Shared link with a 1,N - 0,1 cardinality
<a name="shared_link_with_1n_01_cardinality_ELTPARAGRAPHE000144"></a>

With this type of link:

- each owner has at least one member (a supplier has at least one product).

- a member may have no owner (a product may have no supplier).

### Shared link with a 1,N - 1,1 cardinality
<a name="shared_link_with_1n_11_cardinality_ELTPARAGRAPHE000157"></a>

With this type of link:

- each owner has at least one member (each supplier has at least one product).

- each member has a single owner (each product has a single supplier).

## Complex link
<a name="complex_link_ELTTEXTE000397"></a>


### Definition
<a name="definition_ELTPARAGRAPHE000171"></a>

For a "complex" link, you must manage a link file called **relation file**.

The relationship file will be automatically created. It will contain a unique key that includes the two keys of the related data files.

The relationship file can also contain information specific to the link.

A complex link includes two shared links.

### Example of complex link
<a name="example_complex_link_ELTPARAGRAPHE000185"></a>

An order ("Orders" file) can contain one or more products. A product ("Product" file) can be used in several orders.

In this case, a link file is required ("OrderLine" file).

The "OrderLine" file contains:

- a unique key containing the keys of Product and Orders.

- the number of products ordered.




The links between the files are as follows:
