## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000190"></a>
When handling analyses containing several descriptions of data files, the analysis graph is difficult to read. To manage these large analyses, WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile propose Custom-Folders in the analysis. 

Custom-Folders are used to group several descriptions of data files together. 

These "Custom-Folders" are used to simplify: 

- the search and the display of the description of a data file found in a large analysis. 

- the operation performed on the groups of data files through programming. 
	For example, you can change the connection for all the data files in a Custom-Folder with [HChangeConnection](../WDLang4/3044150.md): to do so, specify the name of the Custom-Folder that must be handled in the WLanguage function (see the list of available functions below). 
	This feature is available for HFSQL Classic data files, HFSQL Client/Server data files and data files handled by Native Access. 




These groupings are defined in the ["Analysis" pane](../Editeurs/2027012.md) or in the analysis graph. These Custom-Folders are not physically created.

The following example groups the data files according to their category:

**Limitations**:

- A Custom-Folder can be empty and contain no data file description.

- It is not mandatory to associate a data file description to a Custom-Folder.

- A Custom-Folder cannot belong to another Custom-Folder.

- Two Custom-Folders cannot have the same name.

- A Custom-Folder cannot have the same name as a data file description.

## Handling the Custom-Folders in the analysis
<a name="handling_the_customfolders_the_analysis_ELTTEXTE000220"></a>
The different operations that can be performed on the Custom-Folders of the analysis are as follows:

- create a Custom-Folder.

- rename a Custom-Folder.

- delete a Custom-Folder.

- associate a file description with a Custom-Folder.

- dissociate a file description from a Custom-Folder.


To handle the Custom-Folders in the analysis, the "Analysis" pane must be displayed. To display the "Analysis" pane, go to the "Home" tab, "Environment" group, expand "Panes", select "Panes" and then select "Analysis".

### Handling a Custom-Folder
<a name="handling_customfolder_ELTPARAGRAPHE000075"></a>

To create a Custom-Folder:

1. In the "Analysis" pane (or in the analysis graph), select "New Custom-Folder" in the context menu (right click). A new Custom-Folder is automatically created.

2. Enter the name of this Custom-Folder and confirm (Enter key).




To rename a Custom-Folder:

1. Select the Custom-Folder to rename in the "Analysis" pane.

2. Open the context menu (right click) and select "Rename" (or press F2).

3. Enter the new name of this Custom-Folder and confirm (Enter key).




To delete a Custom-Folder:

1. Select the Custom-Folder to delete (in the "Analysis" pane or in the analysis graph).

2. Open the context menu (right click) and select "Delete". 

3. The Custom-Folder is deleted. The data files associated with this Custom-Folder are automatically dissociated from this Custom-Folder.




To associate a file description with a Custom-Folder:

1. Select the file description that must be associated with the Custom-Folder.

2. Drag and Drop the description in the desired Custom-Folder. The description is automatically associated with the Custom-Folder.
	**Remark**: If the description already belonged to a Custom-Folder, the description is only associated with the new Custom-Folder.




To dissociate a file description from a Custom-Folder:

1. Select the file description to dissociate in the "Analysis" pane.

2. Right-click to open the context menu and select "Remove from Custom-Folder". 

3. The file description is automatically dissociated from the Custom-Folder.

### Customizing the graphic representation of the Custom-Folder
<a name="customizing_the_graphic_representation_the_customfolder_ELTPARAGRAPHE000112"></a>

Customizing a Custom-Folder consists in displaying a specific background image in the Custom-Folder.

To customize the graphic representation of a Custom-Folder:

1. Select the Custom-Folder in the analysis graph. 

2. Right-click to open the context menu and select "Description".

3. Check "Representation of the Custom-Folder in the analysis graph" and select the desired image. This image will be displayed in the graphic representation of the Custom-Folder.

4. Validate.

### Printing the content of the Custom-Folder
<a name="printing_the_content_the_customfolder_ELTPARAGRAPHE000130"></a>

You have the ability to print the documentation of the elements found in the Custom-Folder: 

1. Select the Custom-Folder in the "Analysis" pane. 

2. Open the context menu (right click) and select "Print".

## Handling groups/Custom-Folders through programming
<a name="handling_groupscustomfolders_through_programming_ELTTEXTE000280"></a>
Several WLanguage functions can be used to handle Custom-Folders through programming: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [HChangeConnection](../WDLang4/3044150.md) | Dynamically changes the connection associated with a data file. |
| [HChangeDir](../WDLang4/3044168.md) | Changes the path to a data file (i.e. directory in which the file will be handled). |
| [HChangeLocation](../WDLang4/3044167.md) | Modifies the search mode of physical data files (.FIC, .NDX, ...). |
| [HClose](../WDLang4/3044073.md) | Closes a data file or all the data files opened by the current user: all the corresponding physical data files are closed for the current user. |
| [HCreationIfNotFound](../WDLang4/3044254.md) | Performs the following operations: <br><br>- If the file does not exist, creates an empty data file (".FIC" file) with the index file and the memo file if necessary. The function is equivalent to [HCreation](../WDLang4/3044255.md). <br><br>- If the file exists, opens the file.<br><br><br> |
| [HFlush](../WDLang4/3044004.md) | Forces the operating system of the computer where the data files are found to write data onto the disk. |
| [HListFile](../WDLang4/3044045.md) | Returns the list of files:<br><br>- found in the current analysis or in a specific analysis recognized by the HFSQL engine. The files defined by [HDeclare](../WDLang4/3044203.md), [HDeclareExternal](../WDLang4/3044204.md) and [HDescribeFile](../WDLang4/3044206.md) are taken into account.<br><br>- available on a connection via a native access or via an OLE DB driver.<br><br>- for a group of files defined in the data model editor.<br><br><br> |
| [HOpen](../WDLang4/3044120.md) | Opens a data file. |
| [HPass](../WDLang4/3044108.md) | Defines the password used to create or open a data file. |
