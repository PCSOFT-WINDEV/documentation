WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile allow you to perform copies (or Drag and Drop) of controls between the products and their editors. 

You have the ability to copy controls: 

- [from the window editor to the page editor](../Editeurs/9000138.md). 

- [from the window editor to the report editor](../Editeurs/9000138.md). 

- [from the page editor to the window editor](../Editeurs/9000139.md). 

- [from the page editor to the report editor](../Editeurs/9000139.md). 

- [from the report editor to the window editor](../Editeurs/9000140.md). 

- [from the report editor to the page editor](../Editeurs/9000140.md). 




During this copy, the controls found in the different editors will be kept as well as the associated code. 

In some cases, the controls will be transformed during the copy to better suit the destination editor.
