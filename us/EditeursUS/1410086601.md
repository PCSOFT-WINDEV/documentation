You can: 

- mark the message as read (AR): the message is read and it was processed. It moves into the list of incoming messages with AR. 

- reply to the message. Several possibilities: 

	- Reply to sender: A new message is created, from the content of the existing message. Only the sender will be the recipient of the new message. You have the ability to add new recipients. 

	- Reply to all: A new message is created, from the content of the existing message. The sender and all the other recipients will be the recipients of the new message. You have the ability to add new recipients. 

	- Transfer: A new message is created, from the content of the existing message. This new message has no default recipient. New recipients must be added. 




- Print ghe message (directly or via a preview). 

- Copy the message text. 

- Move the message to a custom folder. 

- Perform a search in the message.
