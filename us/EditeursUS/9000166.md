### Configuring the grid
<a name="configuring_the_grid_ELTPARAGRAPHE000038"></a>

The snap-on grid simplifies the positioning and the alignment of window controls.

The size of the grid is expressed in pixels.

Recommended options for the grid:

- Invisible grid.

- Grid enabled.

- Vertical spacing of the grid: 12 pixels.

- Horizontal spacing of the grid: 12 pixels.




If the spacing of the grid is set to 1, the grid will not be visible.

For more details, see [Snap-on grid](../Editeurs/2022002.md).


### Automatic positioning
<a name="automatic_positioning_ELTPARAGRAPHE000059"></a>

When moving a control in a window, guides are automatically displayed by the real-time interface checker (also called automatic positioning). The objects snap to the guides, allowing you to align the moved control with the other controls found in the window.

You have the ability to enable (or not) the positioning and the rulers. 

For more details, see [Automatic positioning](../Editeurs/2022003.md). 


### Configuring the rulers
<a name="configuring_the_rulers_ELTPARAGRAPHE000071"></a>

When creating or modifying a window in the window editor, you have the ability to display the alignment rulers. 

These rulers have snap-on guides: any control that comes close to a guide is automatically "snapped" by it. This feature allows you to easily position, align or resize controls in a window.

You have the ability to make the rulers and the guides visible (or not) and to configure the color of the guides. 

For more details, see [Alignment rulers (Editor)](../Editeurs/2022001.md).

## Controls
<a name="controls_ELTTEXTE000420"></a>


### List of fonts
<a name="list_fonts_ELTPARAGRAPHE000163"></a>

To modify the font of the window controls, use the "Font" combo box found in the "Style" tab of the control description.

By default, only the names of the fonts installed on the development computer are displayed in the "Font" combo box.

In Windows, the same font can be associated with several groups of languages. To fill each font name with the associated language, simply check "Display all the available languages".
