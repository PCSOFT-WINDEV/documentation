## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000511"></a>
There are different versions of the SCM repository:

- **Version 10**: initial version.

- **Version 12 (repository format: 12.0.0.205)** created from WINDEV 12: 
	This version allows managing access rights to projects and project elements. The security of sources is reinforced.

- **Version 15 (repository format: 15.0.0.306)** created from WINDEV 15: 
	This version uses binary difference to save the repository history. The size of the repository is reduced.

- **Version 17 (repository format: 17.0.0.407)** created from WINDEV 17: 
	This version allows adding elements with names containing non-latin characters to the repository. 

- **Version 22 (repository format: 22.0.0.408.0)** created from WINDEV 22 and 23: 
	This version allows using all branch management capabilities.

- **Version 24 Update 2 (repository format: 22.0.0.412.9)** created from WINDEV 24 Update 2: 
	This version allows sharing directories between different repositories.

- **Version 24 Update 3 (repository format: 24.0.0.412.16)** created from WINDEV 24 Update 3: 
	This version includes improvements for operations over ADSL connections (check-out, check-in, etc).

- **Version 25 (repository format: 24.0.0.412.17)** created from WINDEV 25: 
	This version features faster creation of branches and remote access.

- **Version 26 (repository format: 24.0.0.414.17)** created from WINDEV 26.

(1): For an SCM repository in version 15 to accept projects in version 14, it is necessary to request the module WX140PACKGDS030f.exe from the useful resources: [https://www.windev.com/ts/useful_resources.htm](https://www.windev.com/ts/useful_resources.htm). 

(2): Use allowed, but not recommended. For example, a project in version 25 can be synchronized with an SCM repository in version prior to 24 Update 3. However, WINDEV 25 will not benefit from the evolutions and optimizations of the SCM repository.

**Remark**: **Creation of the SCM repository**:

- WINDEV 10 and 11 create an SCM repository in version 10.

- WINDEV 12 and 14 create an SCM repository in version 12.

- WINDEV 15 and 16 create an SCM repository in version 15.

- From WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile version 17, you can create SCM repositories: 

	- in version 15 (by default).

	- in version 17 by checking "Enable the support for Unicode" when creating the repository.




- From WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile 22, you can create repositories in version 22.

- From WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile 24 Update 2, you can create repositories in version 24.

- From WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile 24 Update 3, you can create repositories in version 24 Update 3.

- From WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile 25, you can create repositories in version 25.

- From WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile 27, you can create repositories in version 26.

## How to find out the version of an SCM repository?
<a name="how_find_out_the_version_scm_repository_ELTTEXTE000535"></a>
**To find out the version of an SCM repository:**

1. Start the SCM administrator: on the "SCM" tab, in the "Repository" group, expand "Manage" and select "SCM administrator". 

2. In the SCM administrator, on the "Tools" tab, in the "Statistics" group, click "Statistics".

3. The SCM statistics window is displayed. This window contains the details of the repository: ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Int%E9gration%20dans%20le%20GDS%20-%20HC%20N%B0013.jpg)


	- "Repository format" indicates the version of the repository. 

- "Version of stored procedures" indicates the version of the stored procedures. "Version of stored procedures" does not appear in earlier versions of the SCM administrator. In that case, the version of the stored procedures is added to the right of the version. For example, version 22.0.0.412.9 is composed of "22.0.0.412" (the version), and ".9" (version of the stored procedures in the SCM repository).

- "Version of HFSQL server" indicates the version of the HFSQL server used for the SCM. In the case of a local database, the term "ISAM" is displayed.

## How to migrate the format of the SCM repository?
<a name="how_migrate_the_format_the_scm_repository_ELTTEXTE000559"></a>
**To migrate the SCM repository to the new format:**

1. Start the SCM administrator: on the "SCM" tab, in the "Repository" group, expand "Manage" and select "SCM administrator".

2. Connect to the SCM administrator as administrator.

3. On the "Tools" tab, in the "Maintenance" group, click "Migrate repository to the most recent format".




**Caution**:

- **if the SCM repository contains projects in version 12 not recompiled in a more recent version, you must not use the recent formats of the SCM repository.**

- **if the SCM repository contains projects used in versions 14, 15, 16 et 17**, you can use the most recent repository format proposed in the SCM administrator of version 15. Special case for version 14, you must install an update specific to the SCM. To do this, it is necessary to request the module WX140PACKGDS030f.exe from the useful resources: [https://www.windev.com/ts/useful_resources.htm](https://www.windev.com/ts/useful_resources.htm). 

- **if the SCM repository contains projects in versions 17 only**, you can use the format of the SCM repository proposed in the SCM administrator of version 17. The repository will be converted to UNICODE, you will have the ability to store elements, folders, comments in all the character sets.
