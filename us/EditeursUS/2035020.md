## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000087"></a>
A component diagram shows the physical and static architecture of a system software. For example: source files, libraries, executables, etc.

For example, the diagram below presents the steps of a program that allows users to log in in text mode in Unix. The "login" program uses the data from the "etc/passwd" file and a library:

## Elements of a component diagram
<a name="elements_component_diagram_ELTTEXTE000111"></a>
A component diagram includes the following elements:

- **module**: represents the different physical elements that build a software system. For example: a file, a library, etc, ...
	A module can be represented:

	- by a specification that shows the module interface. This specification can be generic for configurable classes.

	- by its body that presents the module implementation.




- **task**: represents a component that has its own control flow (thread).

- **main program** of the software system.

- **subprogram**: groups procedures and functions that do not belong to any classes.

- **package**: divides and organizes the diagram representation (in the same way that directories organize files).
