## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000115"></a>
Each project can be associated with a task list. This list is used to inform the developers about the modifications that must be made to the project.

These modifications can affect:

- a process in the code of the entire project, 

- an object (window, report, ...) to modify or create, etc.


**Remarks**: 

- **This task list is not linked to the Project Monitoring Center.** 

- To manage the tasks and a full schedule, we recommend that you use the Project Monitoring Center. For more details, see [How do I manage my tasks and my schedule](../CCSuivi/3540721.md).

### Adding a task
<a name="adding_task_ELTPARAGRAPHE000041"></a>

Two methods can be used to ask a task, depending on the nature of the task. 

**Case 1: Adding a task specific to the programming**: In the code, enter the description of the task preceded by "//To do". For example:


```wl
// To do: Management of bar codes
```


Remark: To position in the code at the specific location containing the task to perform, all you have to do is double-click the caption of the task in the "Task list" pane.

**Case 2: Adding a task via the "Task list" pane**: Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Ico_Ajout_Tache.gif)
 in the ["Task list" pane](../Editeurs/2027015.md). Each task can:

- Be assigned to one of the project developers.

- Correspond to a specific priority level (high, medium or low priority). This gives you the ability to sort the tasks by priority level.

### Handling the tasks
<a name="handling_the_tasks_ELTPARAGRAPHE000064"></a>

To handle the tasks, use the popup menu of the "Task list" pane.

**Remark**: The display of tasks in the "Task list" pane is not synchronized with the code. For example, if the comment line "// To do: Management of bar codes" is deleted, the corresponding task in the "Task list" pane will not be automatically deleted.
