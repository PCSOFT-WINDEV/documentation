## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000155"></a>
Whenever the application is modified on the development computer (modifications of windows, code, analysis, ...), you must re-create the executable and install an update of the application on the user computers.

For an individual setup, all you have to do is install the update on the user computer.

For a "network" setup, installing the update on the user computers can be mandatory or optional. Indeed, if the modifications do not affect the structure of the data files, the users can continue to work with the version that is already installed.

This help page presents **the update of an application installed in network (live update)**.

## When is an update mandatory?
<a name="when_update_mandatory_ELTTEXTE000179"></a>
An update is mandatory:

- if the analysis was modified.

- in order for all the users to use the same application version.

- if new essential features have been added.




**Remark**: If a new version of WINDEV is used to create the executable of your application, we recommend that you make the update mandatory.

## Reference executable for checking versions
<a name="reference_executable_for_checking_versions_ELTTEXTE000203"></a>
This step of the wizard allows you to specify the application version from which it is mandatory to install the setup.

The following information must be specified:

- ***the current version number***: this number corresponds to the version number of the executable that will be installed. This number is automatically retrieved by setup program creation wizard.
	Remark: The version number is specified when the executable is created. This number can be automatically incremented whenever the executable is created.

- ***the minimum version number allowed to operate without update***: this number corresponds to the version number of the executable found on the user computers from which the update is optional. 
	By default, this number corresponds to the current version number.




Installing the update:

- ***will be mandatory*** if the version of the executable installed on the user computers is **earlier**than the minimum version allowed to run without the update.

- ***will not be mandatory*** if the version of the executable installed on the user computers is **the same or later**than the minimum version allowed to run without the update.




To customize the window for updating your application, click the "Advanced" button. You can:

- enter the modifications performed in the application for this update (history of modifications), 

- configure the options for [Checking the WINDEV executables remotely](../WDAdminExe/2028052.md),

- modify the conditions for applying the update. 
	To inform the users that an application update is available, a window is displayed when the application is started. This window allows the user to install (or not) the update. The conditions for applying the update allow you to configure this window.

## Installing the update on the user computers
<a name="installing_the_update_the_user_computers_ELTTEXTE000227"></a>
When the application is started:

- ***if the update is mandatory***: The users will have to install this update. ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=FenMiseAJourOblig.gif)


- ***if the update is optional***: The users will be able to choose whether they want to install the update or start the application directly. This update will be proposed during the next starts of the application.![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=FenMiseAJour.gif)
This window is displayed in the runtime language of the setup program. Only English and French are available by default. To use another language, the WDSetup project must be translated. For more details, see [WDSetup: Managing additional languages](../Editeurs/2028037.md).

### Example
<a name="example_ELTPARAGRAPHE000083"></a>

In January 2020, version 1.01A of your application was installed on the end-user computers.

In February 2020, the description of a data file was modified and version 1.01B was created. The update of this new version is mandatory.

Then, in March 2020, the appearance of the windows was modified and version 1.01C was created. The update of this version is optional.

When the application is started on the user computers:

- the users who are using version 1.01A will necessarily have to install the update.![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=MAJAppliOblig.gif)


- the users who are using version 1.01B will be able to choose whether they want to install the update or to start the application directly.![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=MAJAppliNonOblig.gif)

### Automatic check for available updates
<a name="automatic_check_for_available_updates_ELTPARAGRAPHE000103"></a>

The application regularly checks if a network update is available. 
Reminder: the check time can be set from WDAdminExe or with [AppChangeParameter](../WDLang1/1000017260.md). 

If there is an available update, a Windows notification will be displayed only if the user is using the application.

- **For optional updates**, the notification message is as follows: 
	An optional update for '&lt;Application name&gt;' is available. To install this update, close and restart the application.

- **For mandatory updates**, the notification message is as follows: 
	A mandatory update for '&lt;Application name&gt;' is available. To install this update, close and restart the application.


These messages cannot be modified or configured. 

The check for available updates is always active. 
**Remarks**: 

- If the user has chosen not to install an optional update at application startup, that version will not be proposed by the notification mechanism. 

- Mandatory update notifications are displayed every 5 minutes if the update has not been installed. 

- Optional update notifications are not displayed again if the update is not installed. It will only appear next time the application is started.






Management of notifications: 

- If the application has an icon in the notification area, the icon will be used to highlight the notification. 

- If the application does not have an icon in the notification area, an icon will be created to highlight the notification. A different icon will be used depending on whether the update is optional or mandatory.


[AppDetectUPDAvailable](../WDLang1/1410087705.md) allows you to customize the automatic check for updates.
