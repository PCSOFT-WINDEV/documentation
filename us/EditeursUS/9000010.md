## Overview

### What is a Java application?
<a name="what_java_application_ELTPARAGRAPHE000011"></a>

A Java application is entirely compiled in Java. If this application uses a database, this database must have a JDBC driver (MySQL, Oracle, etc.). This driver is specific to each database (it can be downloaded from the Internet site of the database publisher).

The access to an HFSQL database is performed natively (in Windows and Linux only). No additional driver is required in this case.

A Java application corresponds to a ".jar" file. It requires the Java Runtime to be executed.

## Developing a Java application with WINDEV

### Why develop a Java application with WINDEV?
<a name="why_develop_java_application_with_windev_ELTPARAGRAPHE000025"></a>

You have developed a WINDEV application for Windows and you want to make this application accessible independently of the operating system? Generate a Java application so that the users working with Mac OS for example will also be able to use your application.

This allows you to share your network applications.

Remark: Mac OS X 10.9 minimum.

### Generating a Java application with WINDEV
<a name="generating_java_application_with_windev_ELTPARAGRAPHE000036"></a>

WINDEV allows you to generate a Java application without even knowing the Java language. The method for developing the application is identical to the method for developing any other WINDEV application.

When the WINDEV project is compiled, the windows and the WLanguage functions are automatically converted into Java.

## The different steps for creating a Java application
<a name="the_different_steps_for_creating_java_application_ELTTEXTE000208"></a>
The steps for creating a Java application with WINDEV are as follows: 

1. [Creating the Java project](../Editeurs/9000007.md).

2. Developing the application.

3. [Using databases](../Editeurs/9000008.md).

4. [Test and compilation](../Editeurs/9000013.md).

5. [Creating the Java archive](../Editeurs/9000009.md):

	- Standard archive,  

	- Archive for Java Web Start.




6. [Deploying the archive](../Editeurs/9000012.md).

### Limitations
<a name="limitations_ELTPARAGRAPHE000072"></a>

The limitations of a JAVA application created with WINDEV affect:

- the supported controls and features

- the available functions

- the programming modifications


For more details, see [Available functions and limitations](../Editeurs/9000056.md) and [Available properties](../Editeurs/9000016.md).

### Java and the management of memory
<a name="java_and_the_management_memory_ELTPARAGRAPHE000091"></a>

By default, the amount of memory allocated to the virtual Java machine (JVM) for running applications is set to 64 MB. 

This amount may not be sufficient if the application requires a large amount of memory (to handle images for example). Errors ("OutOfMemoryException" or "Java Heap Space") may occur if the amount of memory is exceeded when running a Java application. 

To increase the amount of memory allocated to the JVM, specify **"-Xmx&lt;size&gt;"** when the application is started. For example, to allocate 256 MB of memory to an application, specify the following command line when starting the application:


```txt
java -jar -Xmx256m MyArchive.jar
```
