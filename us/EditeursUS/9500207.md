## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000168"></a>
Any program developed with WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile can easily access:

- an HFSQL database.

- a database other than HFSQL.




In any case, all you have to do is describe the database structure in the analysis.

The connections are used to link the description of a data file with the real data. For example, a connection is automatically created when a file belonging to an external database is imported into the data model editor.

The connections are created:

- when importing a data file that belongs to an existing database. For more details, see [Handling an external database](../Editeurs/2011025.md).

- from the data model editor: on the "Analysis" tab, in the "Connection" group, click "Connections".

### Creating a connection (Data model editor)
<a name="creating_connection_data_model_editor_ELTPARAGRAPHE000047"></a>

To create a connection in the data model editor:

1. On the "Analysis" tab, in the "Connection" group, click "New connection".

2. In the connection creation wizard, select the type of connection you want to create:

	- HFSQLDrive (paid solution). 

	- PCSCloud (paid solution).

	- HFSQL Client/Server.

	- HFSQL Classic.

	- an external database.




3. **When creating a connection for HFSQLDrive**, specify the characteristics of your HFSQLDrive database in the different steps of the wizard (for more details on HFDSQLDrive, see [HFSQLDrive, your database in the Cloud in 3 clicks](https://pcscloud-drive.net/UK/HFSQLDrive/index.awp)):

	- the server name or IP address

	- the server port number.

	- the username and password.

	- the database name.

	- the connection name.




4. **When creating a connection for PCSCloud**, specify the characteristics of your PCSCloud account in the different steps of the wizard (for more details on PCSCloud, see [Cloud for HFSQL databases](https://pcscloud.net/UK/cloud_applications.awp)):

	- the server name or IP address

	- the server port number.

	- the username and password.

	- the database name.

	- the connection name.




5. **When creating a connection for HFSQL Client/Server**, specify the following in the different steps of the wizard:

	- the server name or IP address

	- the server port number.

	- the username and password.

	- the database name.

	- the connection name.




6. **When creating a connection for HFSQL Classic**, specify the following in the different steps of the wizard:

	- the connection name.

	- the default directory of data files. 




7. **When creating a connection to an external database**, specify the following in the different steps of the wizard:

	- the type of access used for the connection

	- the name or IP address of server or the file path.

	- the username and password.

	- the database name.

	- the connection name.







Once created, the connection can be associated with a data file in the data file description window

## Benefit of HFSQL Classic connections
<a name="benefit_hfsql_classic_connections_ELTTEXTE000222"></a>


- Using a connection for HFSQL Classic data files makes it easier to switch between connections. To use an HFSQL Client/Server database or an Oracle database for example, simply change the connection defined in the analysis (with [HChangeConnection](../WDLang4/3044150.md) for example).

- Using an HFSQL Classic connection is recommended when using the assisted universal replication
