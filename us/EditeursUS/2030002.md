## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000233"></a>
A WINDEV project and all its elements compatible with WINDEV Mobile (analysis, windows, classes, sets of procedures, queries, etc.) can be opened in WINDEV Mobile. Likewise, a WINDEV Mobile project can be opened in WINDEV.

A WINDEV (or WINDEV Mobile) project and all its elements compatible with WEBDEV (analysis, classes, sets of procedures, queries, ...) can be imported into a new WEBDEV project. 
Likewise, a WEBDEV project can be imported into a new WINDEV project. For more details, see [Importing a WEBDEV project and its elements](../Editeurs/2030041.md).

### Importing WINDEV Mobile elements (windows, reports, ...) into a WINDEV project
<a name="importing_windev_mobile_elements_windows_reports_into_windev_project_ELTPARAGRAPHE000104"></a>

To import WINDEV Mobile elements (windows, reports, ...) into a WINDEV project:

1. Open the WINDEV project where the import must be performed.  

2. On the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, expand "Import" and select "WINDEV or WINDEV Mobile elements". The import wizard starts.

3. Select the WINDEV Mobile project that contains the elements to import or directly select the WINDEV Mobile files to import. Go to the next step.

4. Select the elements to import.

5. If the WINDEV Mobile project contains elements that can be shared with WINDEV (classes, sets of procedures, reports, queries), the import wizard allows you to:

	- share these elements. These elements will not be copied into the WINDEV project but they will be accessible from the project.

	- copy these elements to the WINDEV project. These elements will evolve independently in each project.




6. Validate. The import is automatically performed.

### Project handling codes shared between WINDEV, WINDEV Mobile and WEBDEV
<a name="project_handling_codes_shared_between_windev_windev_mobile_and_webdev_ELTPARAGRAPHE000168"></a>

If the projects share classes or sets of procedures, the elements found in the source project are handled directly. A single source code is used.

You may have adapt the code so that it runs on different platforms. For example, it is recommended to use the InXXXmode functions ([InAndroidMode](../WDLang1/1000018990.md), [IniOSMode](../WDLang1/1000019765.md), etc.) and/or the &lt;IF ExecutionTarget=...&gt; statement to differentiate code that will be executed on a PC, a website or a phone.

### Dependency of the files
<a name="dependency_the_files_ELTPARAGRAPHE000184"></a>

The elements are imported along with their dependencies: all the files linked to the imported element are also imported. The images are automatically converted into a format supported by WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile.
