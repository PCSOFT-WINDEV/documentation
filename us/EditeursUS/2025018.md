### Writing into an unauthorized directory
<a name="writing_into_unauthorized_directory_ELTPARAGRAPHE000031"></a>

Attempt to write into a directory where you do not have sufficient rights (with the fxxx or INIxxx functions for example).

Indeed, if your application has no specific privileges, you are not allowed to write:

- at the root of C.

- into the directory of Windows.

- into the "Program Files" directory.




The data of your applications must be written into the appropriate directories. These directories can be returned and created by [fDataDirCommon](../WDLang1/3036070.md), [fDataDirUser](../WDLang1/3036071.md), [fGlobalDirCommon](../WDLang1/3036072.md), [fGlobalDirUser](../WDLang1/3036073.md).

### Writing into an unauthorized registry key
<a name="writing_into_unauthorized_registry_key_ELTPARAGRAPHE000058"></a>

You are using an application without privilege therefore you are not allowed to write into the "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software" key.

We recommend that you write into another registry key, accessible by all the users of the computer.
