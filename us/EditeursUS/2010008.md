## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000116"></a>
To display a specific help page from your WINDEV application, an identifier must be specified for each page found in your help system. 

This identifier is unique. It will be used:

- in the description of the controls ("Help" tab).

- programmatically with the [WHelp](../WDLang1/3013053.md) function.




The identifiers of help pages can be defined:

- in the description of the page. 
	**Remark**: This method does not allow you to have a global view of all the identifiers used in the help system.

- in the summary window of page identifiers: on the "Modification" tab, in the "Help system" group, click "Help page identifiers".




<a name="NOTE2"></a>
<a name="NOTE2_1"></a>


## Window for managing the page identifiers
<a name="window_for_managing_the_page_identifiers_ELTTEXTE000140"></a>
This window displays the identifier associated with each page. You can:

- modify the identifier of the pages in the list of pages.

- use one of the functions for automatic numbering:

	- **"Auto Num"**: is used to number the pages without identifier. The identifier is automatically calculated according to the greatest identifier used.

	- **"Clear all"**: is used to reset all the identifiers of the help pages to zero.

	- **"Duplicates"**: is used to find the duplicated identifiers.

	- **"Print"**: is used to print the list of pages and associated identifiers.
