### Activation and deactivation through programming
<a name="activation_and_deactivation_through_programming_ELTPARAGRAPHE000168"></a>

To disable the repositionable notes, use [AAFDisable](../WDLang1/1000022018.md) associated with the *aafRepositionableNote* constant. 

To disable or enable repositionable notes in a window through programming, you can also use the [WinEditMode](../Proprietes/1000021824.md) property with the *weAddRepositionableNote* constant:

```wl
MyWindow.WinEditMode = weAddRepositionableNote
```
This property gets and sets all the actions allowed for end users when the "Allow end users to modify the UI" option is enabled.
