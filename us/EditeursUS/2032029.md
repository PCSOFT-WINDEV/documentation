When a "Date" item is found in the query, you have the ability to only select the records corresponding to a given period.

For example:

- the customers born between "01/01/1950" and "01/01/1960".

- the orders placed last month.

- the products sold yesterday.

- etc.




**To display the records corresponding to a given period**:

1. Select "Query description" in the context menu of the query. The query description window appears.

2. In the middle section, select a "Date" item.

3. In the right section, click the "Between two dates" button.

4. Specify the start date and the end date, then validate.


**Remark**: For "DateTime" items, when the start and end dates are values, the query editor suggests preset periods (current month, previous week, calendar year, etc.). To use one of these preset periods, click the "Preset period" button and select the requested period.
