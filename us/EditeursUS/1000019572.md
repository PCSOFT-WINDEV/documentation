## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000175"></a>
Once the action plans are deployed, you have the ability to: 

- configure the action plans (if parameters are defined)

- configure their activation mode. 




These operations are performed in the Software Factory administrator. 

Remarks: 

- You also have the ability to directly run an action plan from a WINDEV application or from a WEBDEV site with [ActionPlanExecute](../WDLang6/1000021332.md). 

- You also have the ability to configure the execution of an action plan from a WINDEV application or from a WEBDEV site with [ActionPlanConfigure](../WDLang6/1000021598.md).

### Configuring the action plans
<a name="configuring_the_action_plans_ELTPARAGRAPHE000033"></a>

In most cases, the action plans can be configured, especially the name of the project. Therefore, the same action plan can be re-used for different projects.  

To configure an action plan:

1. Start the Software Factory administrator: on the "Tools" tab, in the "Utilities" group, click "WDFAdmin".

2. In the window that is displayed, specify the name of the coordinator to which the administrator must connect. 

3. The Software Factory administrator starts. The action plan is configured from the "Action plans" tab. 

4. Select the action plan to configure and click the "Configure the action plan" button. 

5. In the window that is displayed, you have the ability to specify: 

	- The value of the parameters ("Parameters" tab).

	- The maximum duration for running the action plan, expressed in minutes ("Parameters" tab). 

	- The recipients of the notifications ("Notifications" tab). 
			You can also change the name of the action plan. Indeed, each setting performed on an action plan creates a "sub-action plan". We advise you to give an explicit name as well as a description to the sub-action plan. 




6. Validate. 

7. The action plan that was configured appears in the "Action plans" tab. ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Fab_Logicielle_Plan.gif)





**Remark**: By default, the "Action plans" tab of the Software Factory administrator only displays the action plans of the "current" developer. To see the action plans of all the developers, all you have to do is select "All" in the "Action plans of " control.


### Configuring the activation of an action plan
<a name="configuring_the_activation_action_plan_ELTPARAGRAPHE000071"></a>

To configure the activation of an action plan:

1. Start the Software Factory administrator: on the "Tools" tab, in the "Utilities" group, click "WDFAdmin".

2. In the window that is displayed, specify the name of the coordinator to which the administrator must connect. 

3. The Software Factory administrator starts. 

4. Display the "Action plans" tab and select the desired action plan. 

5. You can: 

	- start the action plan directly ("Run the action plan" button). In this case, the action plan is automatically placed into the execution spool of action plans. 

	- schedule the execution of the action plan ("Schedule the action plan" button in the "Action  plans" tab). A wizard starts, allowing you to describe all the scheduling options. 
			Remark: This scheduling can also be performed in the screen used to configure the action plan. 







**Caution**: If parameters have been used during the description of your action plans, don't forget to specify the parameters to run (see previous paragraph). 

If the execution of an action plan was scheduled, the scheduling is displayed in the "Scheduling" tab of the Software Factory administrator. A checkmark displayed in front of the scheduling means that the scheduling is enabled. 



## Remarks

### Execution on a robot
<a name="execution_robot_ELTPARAGRAPHE000104"></a>

A robot will be chosen to run an action plan. The compilation computer (robot computer) must have a version of WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile corresponding to the project to compile. 

During the execution, WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile opens and switches to "software factory" mode. In this case, it is important not to handle the computer on which the robot is run to avoid distorting the results (by moving the mouse during a unit test for example). 

Remark: The Software Factory administrator allows you to follow the execution of the action plans via the runtime spool of action plans ("Robots" tab).  An action plan may have priority. The order of action plans in the spool can be modified via the arrow buttons.


### Reusing the action plans
<a name="reusing_the_action_plans_ELTPARAGRAPHE000116"></a>

A configurable action plan can be re-used by as many projects and by as many developers as necessary: all you have to do is create a new setting. 

To use an existing action plan, click the "Add an action plan" button ("Action plans" tab). 


### Result of the action plans
<a name="result_the_action_plans_ELTPARAGRAPHE000123"></a>

In the parameters of action plan, you can: 

- define the method used to send the status report of the action plan (messaging of Control Centers, email, etc.). 

- see the result of the last execution.
