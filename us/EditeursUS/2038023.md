## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000531"></a>
The SCM administrator (Source Code Manager) allows you to: 

- configure the [options of administrator and SCM](#NOTE2_1). 

- [manage and optimize the SCM repository](#NOTE3_1). 




These tools can only be used by an administrator. 

Remark: The SCM administrator can also be used to manage elements in the repository, etc. For more details, see [Overview of SCM administrator](../Editeurs/2038008.md).

### Options regarding the messaging
<a name="options_regarding_the_messaging_ELTPARAGRAPHE000065"></a>

The "Messaging" tab of SCM options is used to specify whether the integrated messaging must be used. In this case, messages can be sent to the other users (request to unlock, information about the check-in operations, etc.).

If necessary, you can ask to send a message to the users of SCM whenever an element is checked back into the SCM.
<a name="NOTE2_4"></a>


### Options regarding the branches
<a name="options_regarding_the_branches_ELTPARAGRAPHE000074"></a>

The "Branches" tab is used to configure the path created by default when using branches.

This tab allows you to specify the remote and local directories used by default when creating a branch. For more details, see [Managing branches](../Editeurs/2038016.md).
<a name="NOTE2_5"></a>


### Advanced options
<a name="advanced_options_ELTPARAGRAPHE000086"></a>

The "Advanced" tab is used to configure the repository performance for an HFSQL Client/Server repository accessed by ADSL.

In some cases, "Limit the size of packets for ADSL" is used to manage the specific features of some routers.

**Caution**: If this option is not used properly, it may slow down the SCM.

## Managing the SCM
<a name="managing_the_scm_ELTTEXTE000609"></a>


### Overview
<a name="overview_ELTPARAGRAPHE000101"></a>

The administration tools are available only when connecting to the SCM repository as Administrator. To connect to the SCM repository as an administrator, on the "Home" tab, in the "Repository" group, click "Connection ".. 

In the window that appears:

- Specify the characteristics of the repository used.

- Specify the name and password of the repository administrator:

	- If you are using an SCM repository in HFSQL Classic format, administrator corresponds to "Admin" by default (without password).

	- If you are using an SCM repository in HFSQL Client/Server format, administrator corresponds to the "Administrator" user by default.







**Remark**: Establishing a connection to the SCM repository as administrator differs from "Become master on the project". To perform the management operations, you must be connected as administrator.


<a name="NOTE3_2"></a>


### Configuring the authentication
<a name="configuring_the_authentication_ELTPARAGRAPHE000132"></a>

Configuring the authentication allows you to use the database of Control Centers to authenticate the SCM users. The login and password are the ones specified in the Project Monitoring Center.

This option is available only if you are working with an SCM repository in HFSQL Classic format.

To enable the authentication:

1. On the "Management" tab, in the "Security" group, click "Authentication settings".

2. Check "Enable authentication".

3. Specify the database of Control Centers used (in HFSQL Classic format).

4. Validate. 



<a name="NOTE3_4"></a>


### Canceling check-outs
<a name="canceling_checkouts_ELTPARAGRAPHE000160"></a>

The administrator can cancel all ongoing check-outs in the selected project: on the "Management" tab, in the "Check-outs" group, click "Undo check-outs".

A window lists all checked-out elements. You can also list the elements checked out for tests or the elements checked out in a different remote directory.

Simply select the desired elements and click "Undo check-out". The check-out is canceled. The element is in the repository in its status before the check-out.

You have the ability to inform the users ("Send a message to the ones whose check-out was canceled").
<a name="NOTE3_5"></a>


### Repository backup
<a name="repository_backup_ELTPARAGRAPHE000185"></a>

The administrator can make a backup copy of the SCM repository: on the "Management" tab, in the "Backups" group, click "Full backup". This backup copy is saved to a .ZIP file. 
**Remark**: During the backup, the SCM repository can be accessed in read-only.

The backup of the repository can also be performed in a command line via the following notation:


```txt
WDGDSAdmin.exe /SAVE 
		/BASE=<Address of the repository> 
		/LOGIN=<Login> 
		/PASS=<Password> 
		/ZIP=<Full name of zip file>
```
In this code, &lt;Address of the repository&gt; has the following format: 

- For HFSQL Client/Server: "CS:\\\\&lt;IP address of server&gt;:&lt;Server port&gt;\\&lt;Name of SCM repository&gt;"

- For HFSQL Classic: the local path of the repository must be specified. For example: "D:\\PC SOFT\\Local SCM repository\\"




Example: 


```wl
ExeRun("""C:\WINDEV\Programs\WDSCMAdmin.exe"" /SAVE /BASE=CS:\\DOC2:4900\GDS " + ...
		" /LOGIN=admin /PASS=admin /ZIP=C:\Temp\test.zip")
```

<a name="NOTE3_6"></a>


### Saving and clearing the history
<a name="saving_and_clearing_the_history_ELTPARAGRAPHE000218"></a>

The administrator has the ability to delete part of the history from the SCM repository: on the "Management" tab, in the "Backups" group, click "Clear history with backup". The deleted part is automatically saved in a file in .ZIP format. This backup can be restored thereafter.

To save and clear the history, specify the date from which the history must be stored.
<a name="NOTE3_7"></a>


### Restoring a full backup
<a name="restoring_full_backup_ELTPARAGRAPHE000239"></a>

To restore a full backup of the repository, on the "Management" tab, in the "Backups" group, click "Full restore".
<a name="NOTE3_8"></a>


### Restoring a history backup
<a name="restoring_history_backup_ELTPARAGRAPHE000258"></a>

To restore a backup of the repository history, on the "Management" tab, in the "Backups" group, click"Restore history".

<a name="NOTE4"></a>
<a name="NOTE4_1"></a>


## Maintaining the SCM
<a name="maintaining_the_scm_ELTTEXTE000675"></a>
The SCM administrator proposes several maintenance options. These options allow you to optimize and manage the SCM repository at any time.
<a name="NOTE4_2"></a>


### Migrating the repository to the most recent format
<a name="migrating_the_repository_the_most_recent_format_ELTPARAGRAPHE000284"></a>

To migrate the SCM repository to a more recent format, go to the "Tools" tab, "Maintenance" group, and click "Migrate to most recent format ". This format optimizes the accesses to the database.

**Remark**: To use this option, the SCM repository must not be directly installed on a share name.

For example, if the files are installed on "\\\\Server\\SCM" where "SCM" is the name of the shared directory, the option will not operate. The files must be installed in a directory such as "\\\\Server\\SCM\\SCMRepository"

If this is not the case, the data files can be moved manually (all users must be disconnected). The next time a project is opened, you will have to specify the new directory of the SCM repository.

Caution: Do not hesitate to see the help page on [SCM file format evolutions](../Editeurs/2038018.md). 
<a name="NOTE4_3"></a>


### Switching the repository to Client/Server
<a name="switching_the_repository_clientserver_ELTPARAGRAPHE000314"></a>

To start the wizard and switch the repository to HFSQL Client/Server mode, go to the "Tools" tab, "Maintenance" group, and click "Switch to Client/Server".
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=GDS_Client_serveur.gif)
This operation can be performed only if an HFSQL Client/Server engine is installed on the server where the SCM repository must be installed.

You must specify:

- The server name. 

- The database name and port.

- The name and password of an HFSQL database administrator.




Depending on the size of the SCM repository, migrating the repository may take quite a long time.

At the end of this operation, the SCM proposes to automatically create the user account corresponding to the connected user (if this account does not exist).

The next time the project is opened, you will have to specify the new parameters for connecting to SCM.

**Remark**: The SCM repository in "Classic" mode is not deleted. Once the migration to the HFSQL Client/Server format is over, you must inform all the users in order for them to change their parameters for connecting to the SCM repository.


<a name="NOTE4_4"></a>


### Re-index and repair
<a name="reindex_and_repair_ELTPARAGRAPHE000351"></a>

On the "Tools" tab, in the "Maintenance" group, click "Reindex and repair". This option is used to:

- Reindex the SCM repository (whether it is in HFSQL Classic mode or in HFSQL Client/Server mode). 

- Cancel the locked transactions on the SCM repository.

- Analyze and repair the SCM repository.





<a name="NOTE4_5"></a>


### Repairing a directory
<a name="repairing_directory_ELTPARAGRAPHE000378"></a>

In some case, repairing a directory is used to fix some problems regarding the access to the data found in an SCM directory. This option is used to repair the directory without locking the SCM repository during this operation. 

To repair a directory: 

- Select the directory to repair in the list of directories of the SCM repository. 

- On the "Tools" tab, in the "Maintenance" group, click "Repair a directory". This option is used to repair the SCM repository for this directory.




Remark: If necessary, the SCM automatically propose to repair the directory only (instead of repairing the entire SCM repository).

## Performing a search in the SCM
<a name="performing_search_the_scm_ELTTEXTE000735"></a>
Several search modes are available in the SCM repository:

- **Search by name** (on the "Tools" tab, in the "Find" group, click "By name"): This option is used to easily find an element in the SCM repository. Simply specify the name of the element to search for.

- **Search by check-out** (on the "Tools" tab, in the "Find" group, click "By check-out"): This option is used to find the check-outs according to the user (current user, specific user, all the users) and to the type of check-out (for test, exclusive, etc.). You have the ability to check in an element or to cancel a check-out.

- **Search by task or incident**: This option is used to find the elements corresponding to the execution of a task or incident. You can see the changes made.

- **Search in the history**: This option is used to perform a search in the history of actions performed in this SCM. This allows you to get all comments typed between two dates and to export them into a file. For more details, see [Search in SCM history](../Editeurs/2038028.md).

## Various options
<a name="various_options_ELTTEXTE000759"></a>


### My Projects
<a name="projects_ELTPARAGRAPHE000447"></a>

To list the projects with a local directory on the current computer: 

1. On the "Tools" tab, in the "Find" group, click "My projects". 

2. In the window that appears, specify the desired login if necessary and click "Find". 

3. The remote directory and the local directory are displayed for each project found.




You have the ability to delete the association between the remote directory and the local directory ("Delete the association" button). This option is useful when a project of SCM was opened then deleted from the local computer: by deleting the association, the user will no longer receive the automatic messages of SCM regarding this project.
