## The steps for creating a RAD pattern
<a name="the_steps_for_creating_rad_pattern_ELTTEXTE000215"></a>
The steps for creating a WINDEV RAD pattern are as follows:

1. [Creating the "RAD Pattern" project.](../Editeurs/2031021.md)

2. Creating the different pattern windows.

	- [Form window](../Editeurs/2031025.md) (with link buttons if necessary).

	- [Table window](../Editeurs/2031026.md) (with link buttons if necessary).

	- [Relation window](../Editeurs/2031027.md) (with link buttons if necessary).

	- [Vision Plus buttons and window](../Editeurs/2031029.md).

	- **Menus**




3. [Generating the RAD pattern.](../Editeurs/2031023.md).

4. [Using the RAD pattern](../Editeurs/2031024.md).

### The files to create
<a name="the_files_create_ELTPARAGRAPHE000042"></a>

Reminder: To build a RAD pattern used to create a full project, the following files are required:

- A form for RADFileA.

- A form for RADFileB. A combo box and a Vision Plus button (or a popup combo box) must allow you to select an element of RADFileA.

- A form for RADFileC. A combo box and a Vision Plus button (or a popup combo box) must allow you to select an element of RADFileB.

- A table for RADFileA.

- A table for RADFileB.

- A table for RADFileC.

- A relation window RADFileB/RADFileD.




These different elements must contain link buttons. You also have the ability to provide the main menu of the application.

### Standard to follow
<a name="standard_follow_ELTPARAGRAPHE000059"></a>

This help page presents the different rules that must be applied when creating the pages and windows of the RAD pattern. These rules have been used to create the different patterns supplied with WINDEV 16.

These rules are recommendations. You can implement and use your own standard.

## Menus
<a name="menus_ELTTEXTE000269"></a>


### Overview
<a name="overview_ELTPARAGRAPHE000070"></a>

Any window of your pattern can include a menu. Several types of menus are available:

- a drop-down menu found in the first window of the application.

- a menu in a Carousel control.

- a menu in button format.




These menus are used to open:

- the form windows and the tables windows defined in the pattern

- other windows found in the pattern (a window for configuring the emails, ...).




The following paragraphs explain how to create a drop-down menu, a carousel menu and a button menu.

**Important: don't forget to define the first project window in your RAD pattern. In most cases, this first window corresponds to the menu window.**

### Drop-down menu
<a name="dropdown_menu_ELTPARAGRAPHE000090"></a>

In most cases, the drop-down menu is included in a specific window but it can be included in any window of your pattern.

To create a drop-down menu: 

1. Create (if necessary) the window where the menu will be displayed.

2. Create the menu: on the "Window" tab, in the "Bars and menus" group, expand "Main menu" and select "Add main menu".

3. The menu options used for the specific RAD options must have a specific name: "MENUFIC_". The menu with this name will be duplicated as many times as necessary for the different files of the analysis that require a menu entry. The code associated with the options will also be duplicated and adapted (if necessary) to the file used.




The other menu options (used to start a feature included in the pattern for instance) can have any name. They will be automatically generated.

**Example**: ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Pattern_Menu_deroulant.gif)


Remarks:

- You have the ability to include separators in the menu.

- An image can be associated with the menu options. This image will not be customized by the user.

### Carousel menu
<a name="carousel_menu_ELTPARAGRAPHE000125"></a>

To optimize the appearance of your applications, you have the ability to use a menu in the format of a Carousel control. The images scroll, allowing the user to choose a specific option.

To create a carousel menu: 

1. Create (if necessary) the window where the menu will be displayed.

2. Create a Carousel control: on the "Creation" tab, in the "Other controls" group, click "Carousel".

3. The Carousel control used must be named "MENUCAR_".

4. The code for selecting a line in the carousel menu can be:



```wl
SWITCH Myself
	CASE 1: 
		//RADSTART
		Open(WIN_Table_RADFileA)
		//RADEND
	CASE 2: 
		Open(WIN_Table_RADFileB)
	CASE 3: 
		Open(WIN_Table_RADFileC)
END
```
In this example, the "//RADSTART" and "//RADEND" comments are mandatory: they are used to enclose the code that will be duplicated for each file processed by RAD.

### Creating a button menu
<a name="creating_button_menu_ELTPARAGRAPHE000154"></a>

To optimize the appearance of your applications, you can use a menu in the format of a set of button controls. You can define the shape and layout of the buttons in your menu.

To create a button menu: 

1. Create (if necessary) the window where the menu will be displayed.

2. Create the button controls of your menu.

3. The button controls of the menu must be named "MENUCTRFIL_", with the associated code.




For example: MENUCTRFIL_RADFileA button, with "RADFileA management"as caption, and as code: 

```wl
Open(WIN_Table_RADFileA)
```
**4.** You can create additional buttons to set their position in advance (if many files are used during the generation, for example). These buttons are named MENUCTR_X and they have no associated code (MENUCTR_1 for example). If these additional buttons are not created, the menu buttons will be stacked.
