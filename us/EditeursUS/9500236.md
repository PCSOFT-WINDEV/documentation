### Application security
<a name="application_security_ELTPARAGRAPHE000126"></a>

WINDEV gives you the ability to lock your applications (after a specific duration for example). All the application windows are minimized and made invisible. A password is required when the user wants to restore the application.

The "Automatically lock the application..." option allows you to implement this functionality. 

For more details, see [Locking an application](../WDLang6/3061101.md).
