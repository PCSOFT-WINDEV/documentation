## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000189"></a>
The project comparator is used to compare two elements and to list the differences found.

For more details, see [Project comparator](../Editeurs/2030024.md).

Once the differences have been listed, you have the ability to carry over from an element to another one:

- the code differences.

- the differences of characteristics (size and position of a window or page for instance).

- the controls found in one of the two elements only (window, page or report).

- the local procedures found in one of the two elements only (window, page or report).

- the global procedures found in one of the two sets of procedures only.

- the methods found in one of the two classes only.

 to carry over the control selected in the left window into the right window.





**Limitation:** The following elements cannot be carried over:

- the columns of a table. However, a Table control can be carried over.

- the attributes of a looper. However, a looper can be carried over.

- a control belonging to another control  (supercontrol, looper control, cell, internal window, ...). In this case, the "container" control must also be carried over. 
	However, when carrying over a control that contains other controls (supercontrols, looper control, cell, internal window, and so on), you have the ability to carry over some of the controls found in this control.

- the popup menus and/or their menu options.
