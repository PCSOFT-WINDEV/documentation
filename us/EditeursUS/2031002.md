### CAUTION: The RAD was entirely revamped from version 12. This documentation page is kept for backward compatibility.

**For more details on the new RAD patterns, see [New RAD patterns](../Editeurs/2031020.md).**

The RAD (Rapid Application Development) is used to quickly create windows from preset patterns. By default, 10 patterns of RAD windows are supplied with WINDEV.

Each pattern corresponds to a Script file (.MDL extension). This file contains:

- The description of the RAD pattern, displayed when starting the window creation wizard

- The different steps of the wizard

- The description of the generated window and its code

- The description of the generated controls and their code

## The pattern files
<a name="the_pattern_files_ELTTEXTE000276"></a>
All the files used by the RAD (window or project RAD) are available in the "\\Personal\\Templates\\RAD" subdirectory of WINDEV.

For each RAD pattern, this directory contains:

- **A BMP file "RAD_WIN_xx"**:
	image corresponding to the icon for the type of the generated window, XX corresponds to the number of the RAD pattern.

- **An MDL file** containing the script for the RAD pattern.

- The files of the different WINDEV classes (.WDC) used by the patterns of the Object RAD




The correspondence of the files supplied by default is as follows:

| Pattern # | Type of window | Image of icon | MDL file |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | [Form with browse](../Editeurs/2031003.md) | RAD_WIN_02 | Form.mdl |
| 3 | [Table](../Editeurs/2031003.md) | RAD_WIN_03 | Table.mdl |
| 4 | [Vision +](../Editeurs/2031003.md) | RAD_WIN_04 | Vision_Plus.mdl |
| 5 | [Table with detailed form](../Editeurs/2031003.md) | RAD_WIN_05 | Table_Detailed_Form.mdl |
| 6 | [Form with linked table](../Editeurs/2031003.md) | RAD_WIN_06 | Form_Table.mdl |
| 7 | [Form with relation table](../Editeurs/2031003.md) | RAD_WIN_07 | Form_Relation_Table.mdl |
| 8 | [Relation table](../Editeurs/2031003.md) | RAD_WIN_08 | Table_Relation.mdl |
| 9 | [Table + Linked table](../Editeurs/2031003.md) | RAD_WIN_09 | Table_Table.mdl |
| 10 | [Simple form](../Editeurs/2031003.md) | RAD_WIN_10 | Simple_Form.mdl |
| 11 | [Form + Form](../Editeurs/2031003.md) | RAD_WIN_11 | Form_Form.mdl |

## Modifying or creating a RAD pattern

### Modifying an existing RAD pattern
<a name="modifying_existing_rad_pattern_ELTPARAGRAPHE000147"></a>

To modify an existing RAD pattern: 

1. In the "\\Personal\\Templates\\RAD" directory of WINDEV, create a backup copy of all your script files (mdl extension).

2. Open the pattern file that must be modified in the notepad (notepad.exe) of Windows.

3. Modify the code of the script according to your requirements. For more details on the script code, see [The structure of the RAD patterns](../Editeurs/2031001.md).

4. Save changes

5. Restart WINDEV. The modifications performed in the template file will be automatically taken into account.

### Creating a new RAD pattern from an existing pattern
<a name="creating_new_rad_pattern_from_existing_pattern_ELTPARAGRAPHE000163"></a>

To create a new RAD pattern from an existing pattern: 

1. In the "\\Personal\\Templates\\RAD" directory of WINDEV, create a backup copy of all your script files (mdl extension).

2. Rename the "Copy of ..." file of the pattern file that will be used as base for your new pattern.

3. Open this pattern file in the Notepad (notepad.exe) of Windows.

4. Modify the following code according to your requirements:





```txt
#############################
# name of the pattern
#############################
Name=Form with linked form
Title=Form and form
Number=11
#############################
# description of the pattern
#############################
Description=Beginning
Form with Linked Form pattern.
This pattern is suited for the files linked by a simple link.
Description=End
```





|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Name of the pattern displayed in the window creation wizard. |
| Title | Title of the generated window. |
| Number | Number of the RAD pattern. This number must be modified to create a new RAD pattern. |
| Description = Beginning<br>Description = End | Description of the pattern displayed in the window creation wizard. |

**Remark**: the code of the MDL files is not indented and it cannot be indented.

**5.** Modify the code of the script according to your requirements. For more details on the script code, see [The structure of the RAD patterns](../Editeurs/2031001.md).
**6.** Save the modifications.
**7.** Create (if necessary) the images associated with the new RAD pattern (RAD_Win_XX.BMP where xx corresponds to the number of the pattern).
**8.** Restart WINDEV. The new pattern is displayed when the window creation wizard starts.
