## How to customize the User Groupware?
<a name="how_customize_the_user_groupware_ELTTEXTE000278"></a>
Several solutions are proposed by WINDEV/WEBDEV to customize the User Groupware. This page explains how to:

- [Customize and translate the windows and the pages, ...](#NOTE2_1)

- [Modify the first window of the application (or the first page of the site) according to the user](#NOTE2_3),

- [Start the login window or page from an application window or from a site page](#NOTE2_4),

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) [Define the rights on popup menus](#NOTE3_1)

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) [Define the rights on the options of the automatic menu ("?" menu)](#NOTE3_2)

- [Configure the location of the data files specific to the groupware](#NOTE4_1).

- [Reinitialize the data files specific to the groupware](#NOTE5_1).

- [Modify the data files specific to the groupware](#NOTE6_1).

## Customizing the windows and the pages
<a name="customizing_the_windows_and_the_pages_ELTTEXTE000302"></a>


### Customizing the windows and the pages
<a name="customizing_the_windows_and_the_pages_ELTPARAGRAPHE000053"></a>

***The login window/page***

You may want to customize the login window/page that is displayed when starting your application. If this window or page is included in your project, the style or the skin templates used by your application can be applied to this window or page.

**Caution**: This window/page must not be renamed.

***All the windows/pages of user groupware***

If all the windows/pages of user groupware have been included in your project, they can all be customized. However, only the login window/page will be viewed by all the users. The windows/pages for configuring the groupware can only be viewed by the supervisor of the application .

**Caution**:

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) The GPWLogin and GPWSupervisorMenu windows must not be renamed.




For more details, see [The windows and pages of user groupware](../Editeurs/2018010.md).
<a name="NOTE2_2"></a>


### Translating the windows/pages for the multilingual applications
<a name="translating_the_windowspages_for_the_multilingual_applications_ELTPARAGRAPHE000082"></a>

To use the User Groupware in a multilingual application, see [User Groupware and multilingual feature](../Editeurs/2018008.md).
<a name="NOTE2_3"></a>


### Modifying the first window or the first page according to the user
<a name="modifying_the_first_window_the_first_page_according_the_user_ELTPARAGRAPHE000092"></a>

To change the first application window or the first site page according to the user, [gpwGetUserInfo](../WDLang6/3041004.md) must be called in the initialization code of your project. This option allows you to get information about the user such as his name or password for example.

Depending on his name, you have the ability to open a given window or a given page.

Example:


```wl
IF gpwGetUserInfo(gpwLogin) = "FP" THEN
	Open(WIN_Management)
ELSE
	Open(WIN_Menu)
END
```

<a name="NOTE2_4"></a>


### Starting the login window/page from an application window or from a site page
<a name="starting_the_login_windowpage_from_application_window_from_site_page_ELTPARAGRAPHE000108"></a>

When the User Groupware is included in an application, you can choose whether the User Groupware will be automatically started or not. This option can be modified at any time.

By default (automatic start), the login window/page is the first window/page of the application. It is run with the initialization code of the project.

**In some cases, you may want to open a configuration window before the login window**. To do so, you must:

1. Select "Manual start".

2. Open the login window or page anywhere in the code with [gpwOpen](../WDLang6/3041002.md).

## Defining the rights on the menus

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png) 

### Define the rights on popup menus
<a name="define_the_rights_popup_menus_ELTPARAGRAPHE000129"></a>

To define the rights on the popup menus, all the windows of user groupware must be included. Then, you can modify the window for managing rights (***GPWConfigurationDetails.WDW***). 

To get the list of context menus, use [EnumSubElement](../WDLang1/3064002.md) (associated with the *enumFirst + enumContextMenu* constants).
<a name="NOTE3_2"></a>
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png) 

### Defining the rights on the automatic menu ("?" menu)
<a name="defining_the_rights_the_automatic_menu_menu_ELTPARAGRAPHE000143"></a>

Some options of the automatic menu must be used with great care. These options are as follows:

- Optimize access speed to the database

- Save data

- Save application

- Repair the database.




The operating mode of these options with the User Groupware is as follows:

- By default, these options are grayed if the user is not the supervisor.

- To allow a non-supervisor user to access these options, modify the rights of the internal window named IW_MenuHWinDevHelp that contains the popup menu.

**Remark**: This behavior was implemented since WINDEV 10 version 100050. If you already have customized the groupware and included the window for modifying the rights in your application, you must copy:

- the GPWAssociationConfiguration.wdw window. This window is found in the Programs\\Data\\Models\\GPW\\WD directory of WINDEV.

- the wdxxxgpu.dll file found in the Programs directory of WINDEV.

## Configuring the data files of user groupware
<a name="configuring_the_data_files_user_groupware_ELTTEXTE000374"></a>
Two types of data files are used by the User Groupware:

- Data files of users

- Data files of rights




The location of these data files can be configured:

- When including the user groupware for test ("Workshop .. Configure the user groupware").

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) When creating the executable.

- When installing the application (by the person who performs the setup).

- Through programming.




For more details, see [User Groupware files](../Editeurs/2018002.md).

<a name="NOTE5_1"></a>


## Reinitializing the data files
<a name="reinitializing_the_data_files_ELTTEXTE000398"></a>


### To reinitialize the data files of user groupware
<a name="reinitialize_the_data_files_user_groupware_ELTPARAGRAPHE000193"></a>

All you have to do is delete the data files specific to the User Groupware (file of users and file of rights). These files are automatically re-created when starting the application.
<a name="NOTE5_2"></a>


### Remarks
<a name="remarks_ELTPARAGRAPHE000200"></a>

- If the user files are deleted (GPWUserConfiguration and GPWUser), only the supervisor will be able to start the application.

- If the rights files are deleted (GPWElementConfiguration, GPWConfiguration and GPWElement), all the users will have all the rights on the entire application.




For more details, see [User Groupware files](../Editeurs/2018002.md).

**Caution**: The &lt;None&gt; group and the DEFAULT group cannot be deleted.

## Modifying the data files
<a name="modifying_the_data_files_ELTTEXTE000428"></a>
The structure of the data files specific to the user groupware cannot be modified.

**Remark**: These files contain confidential information and therefore they are encrypted.
<a name="NOTE6_2"></a>


### Managing the analyses
<a name="managing_the_analyses_ELTPARAGRAPHE000224"></a>

If a specific analysis is opened when configuring the User Groupware, [gpwInitAnalysis](../WDLang6/3041005.md) (used to open the analysis of the User Groupware) must be executed again.

**Reminder**: At run time, several analyses cannot be opened at the same time.
