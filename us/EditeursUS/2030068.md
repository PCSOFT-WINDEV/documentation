## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000144"></a>
"Dynamic serving" is a technique where the same address (URL) leads to 2 different pages: a page for PC and a page for mobile.

The proper page will be displayed according to the device (PC or mobile) that accesses the page.

This is an alternate solution (even complementary) to "[Responsive Web Design](../WDChamp/9000165.md)" to make a standard site "mobile friendly". With "Dynamic serving", no need to modify the existing pages: all you have to do is add some for the mobile devices.

This technique benefits from an excellent SEO by Google.

Remarks: "Dynamic serving" is available for the dynamic pages and for the Active WEBDEV Pages (not stand-alone).

## Principe and operating mode
<a name="principe_and_operating_mode_ELTTEXTE000168"></a>
The site includes 2 sets of pages: the pages for computer and the pages for mobile device. These pages are associated 2 by 2. 

When the page address is typed in the browser, the environment used is automatically detected and the corresponding page (computer or mobile device) is displayed in the browser. The address displayed in the browser does not change: only the content displayed is adapted to the system. 

All the links and the pages opened in the code are automatically redirected to the corresponding page in the current platform. 



**Remarks**: 

- The detection of the environment is performed according to the Google recommendations: the tablets are not considered as being mobile devices. 

- The pages are identified by Google as being in "Dynamic serving" mode. Therefore, the different page versions are optimized. If the mobile pages are developed properly, the site is considered as being "Mobile friendly". 

- Caution, Dynamic Serving is not available on a PHP server. However, for a mixed site that would mix dynamic and PHP, the Active WEBDEV Pages that reference PHP pages must use Dynamic Serving. In this case, the PHP pages are listed by Dynamic Serving.

<a name="configuration_ELTPARAGRAPHE000047"></a>

To use "Dynamic serving" in a WEBDEV site: 

1. Create the pages specific to the mobile interface in your project. 

2. On the "Project" tab, in the "Web" group, expand "SEO" and select "Dynamic Serving".

3. The window that is displayed includes three sections: 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Dynamic%20serving%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif&type=thumb)


	- 1. The list of common pages (displayed regardless of the platform). 

- 2. The list of pages for computer.

- 3. The list of pages for mobile.

4. To perform page associations:

	- In the "Common pages" list, select the page corresponding to the "Computer version" page. 

	- Drag and Drop the page to the "Computer version" section or click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Dynamic%20serving%20-%20HC%20N%B0001%201.gif)
. 

	- The corresponding "Mobile version" section appears in red.  

	- In the "Common pages" list, select the page corresponding to the "Mobile version" page. 

	- Drag and Drop the page to the "Mobile version" section or click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Dynamic%20serving%20-%20HC%20N%B0001%202.gif)
.







When all the associations are performed, validate the window. 


### Remarks
<a name="remarks_ELTPARAGRAPHE000074"></a>

- The associations are saved in the pages. If your pages are found in the SCM, a check-out of mobile pages is requested. 

- The associated pages must have the same prototype. If the expected parameters are not the same, the pages are displayed on a red background in the window for managing the associations. 

- Stand-alone Active WEBDEV Pages cannot be associated. 

- The controls used from the outside of the page (syntax: &lt;Page name&gt;.&lt;Control name&gt;) must be found in the two pages of the association. 

- [DynamicServingConfigure](../WDLang2/1000021994.md) is used to create a "Mobile site" link or a "Site for computer" link that forces the display of the site for a given environment. 





### Testing a "Dynamic serving" site
<a name="testing_dynamic_serving_site_ELTPARAGRAPHE000085"></a>

By default, when running the test of a page or site, the "Computer" version of the site is automatically started. 

To run the test of a project or page in "Mobile" mode, all you have to do is enable the test option in mobile: 

1. In the quick access buttons, expand the Combo Box found beside the requested "GO" icon (page test or project test): ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Dynamic_serving_1%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.gif)


2. Select "Debug the mobile version (Dynamic Serving)". 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Dynamic_serving_1%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif)


3. The next page or project tests will be run in mobile mode. To go back to "Computer" mode, all you have to do is select "Debug the mobile version (Dynamic Serving)" again in order to disable it. 




Caution: This option is available in GO mode for page and site. It can be enabled/disabled for the page GO and/or for the site GO only.
