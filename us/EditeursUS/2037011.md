<a name="configuring_the_server_for_the_cgi_protocol_ELTTEXTE000133"></a>
To configure the Web server: 

1. Edit the "httpd.conf" file in a text editor. 
	This file is located in the "/Conf" subdirectory of the Apache server  setup directory.

2. Add the alias definition for the CGI protocol (WD280AWP.EXE) to the "httpd.conf" file with the following lines:
	
	```txt
	ScriptAlias /<Alias>/ "Engine directory"
	```

	**Example: Development computer**: the engine is in the "C:\\WEBDEV\\PROGRAMS\\ENGINE\\WINDOWS\\AWP" directory and the alias name is WD280AWP:
	
	```txt
	ScriptAlias /WD280AWP/ "C:/WEBDEV/PROGRAMS/ENGINE/WINDOWS/AWP/"
	```

	**Example: Deployment computer**: the engine is in the "C:\\WEBDEV\\ENGINE\\WINDOWS\\AWP" directory and the alias name is WD280AWP:
	
	```txt
	ScriptAlias /WD280AWP/ "C:/WEBDEV/ENGINE/WINDOWS/AWP/"
	```


3. Restart the Apache server.




**Remarks**

- the \\ characters are changed into /

- don't forget the final / in the path.

- the case sensitivity must be complied with.

<a name="configuring_the_server_for_webdev_sites_ELTTEXTE000157"></a>
To configure the Web server:

1. Edit the "httpd.conf" file in a text editor. This file is located in the "/Conf" subdirectory of the Apache server  setup directory.

2. Add into the "httpd.conf" file the definition of alias for the images of each WEBDEV site:
	
	```txt
	Alias /<Name of Image alias>/ "Directory of application images"
	```

	Example for the WEBDEMO site: 
	
	```txt
	Alias /WEBDEMO_WEB/ "C:/WEBDEMO/WEBDEMO_WEB/"
	```


3. Restart the Apache server.

### Caution
<a name="caution_ELTPARAGRAPHE000064"></a>

- With the Apache server, the alias name is "case sensitive". You must comply with the case defined for the alias in the HTML pages that refer to the directory of images.

- An alias of images must be defined for each WEBDEV site.
