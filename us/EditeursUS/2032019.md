## Overview

<a name="Selection_condition"></a>
The selection conditions of records are applied to the items used in the queries. These conditions are used to select the records that match one or more specific criteria.

For example:

- customers whose name starts with "C".

- products whose price exceeds 500 Euros.

- orders placed between "01/01/2000" and "06/01/2000".

- ...




Several selection conditions can be defined for a single item.

The selection conditions are defined when creating the query. However, you have the ability to add, modify or delete the selection conditions used in a query. These operations are described in the following paragraphs.

When at least two selection conditions are found in a query, the sequence of the selection conditions must be specified. For more details, see [Sequence of selection conditions](../Editeurs/2032055.md).
