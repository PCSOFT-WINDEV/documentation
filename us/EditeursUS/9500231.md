## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000258"></a>
Starting with version 25, you can create "project portfolios".

A project portfolio is a set of logically grouped projects.

These projects often have functional links: they share components, classes, sets of procedures, etc.

A project portfolio allows you to perform actions on the entire portfolio, such as:

- recompilation in new version, 

- branch creation, 

- ...


No more repetitive actions when changing from one version to another or during a Sprint!
