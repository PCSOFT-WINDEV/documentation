## Opening an application
<a name="opening_application_ELTTEXTE000195"></a>
Several actions are automatically performed when opening an application. These actions are performed in the following order:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| 1. | Initializing the User Groupware (starting the windows of the User Groupware if "Automatic start" is checked).<br>For more details on the User Groupware, see [User Groupware](../Editeurs/2018001.md). |
| 2. | Opening the analysis associated with the project and initializing the HFSQL variables.<br><br> |
| 3. | Loading the components associated with the project. |
| 4. | Loading the sub-components (\*) associated with the project. |
| 5. | Running the declaration events of the classes of the sub-components (\*) associated with the project. |
| 6. | Running the declaration events of the sets of procedures of the sub-components (\*) associated with the project. |
| 7. | Running the initialization events (\*\*) of the sub-components (\*) associated with the project. |
| 8. | Running the declaration events of the classes of the components associated with the project. |
| 9. | Running the declaration events of the sets of procedures of the components associated with the project. |
| 10. | Running the initialization event (\*\*) of the components associated with the project. |
| 11. | Loading the external libraries (".WDL" file).<br>For more details, see [Library](../Editeurs/2030022.md). |
| 12. | Running the declaration events of the classes of external libraries. |
| 13. | Running the declaration events of the sets of procedures of external libraries. |
| 14. | Running the declaration events of the project classes. |
| 15. | Running the declaration events of the sets of procedures of the project. |
| 16. | Running the initialization event of the project. |

(\*) A sub-component is a component included in a component associated with the project.

(\*\*) The initialization event of a component is run only when the component uses the same execution context as the project.
For more details on the component generation options, see [Creating and generating an external component](../Editeurs/2014002.md).

## Closing an application
<a name="closing_application_ELTTEXTE000225"></a>
Several actions are automatically performed when closing an application. These actions are performed in the following order:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| 1. | Running the closing event of the project. |
| 2. | Running the closing event of the sets of procedures:<br><br>- of the project.<br><br>- of the external libraries (".WDL" file).<br><br>- of the libraries loaded in memory by [LoadWDL](../WDLang1/3013020.md).<br><br><br> |
| 3. | Running the closing event of the classes:<br><br>- of the project.<br><br>- of the external libraries (".WDL" file).<br><br>- of the libraries loaded in memory by [LoadWDL](../WDLang1/3013020.md).<br><br><br> |
| 4. | Unloading the components loaded in memory: Running the closing events: <br><br>- of components.<br><br>- of sets of procedures of components.<br><br>- of classes of components.<br><br><br> |
| 5. | Unloading the sub-components(\*) loaded in memory: Running the closing events:<br><br>- of sub-components (\*).<br><br>- of sets of procedures of sub-components (\*).<br><br>- of classes of sub-components (\*).<br><br><br> |

(\*) A sub-component is a component included in a component associated with the project.
