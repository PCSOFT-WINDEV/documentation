## Creating the executable
<a name="creating_the_executable_ELTTEXTE000123"></a>
The executable of an application that supports the User Groupware is a multi-instance executable.

To create an executable that supports the user groupware: 

1. Start the executable generation wizard via one of the following methods: 

	- On the "Project" tab, in the "Generation" group, click "Generate". 

	- Expand ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_generation_exe.gif)
 in the quick access buttons and select "Generate 32-bit Windows executable (.exe)". 




2. A step specific to the User Groupware is displayed in the executable creation wizard ("Data and groupware" option in the left section of the screen). This step sets the default path for the User Groupware files. This directory corresponds by default to a subdirectory of the executable directory (EXE\\GPW_&lt;Project name&gt; directory).
	Remark: The path of data files found in the groupware can also be specified when installing the application.

3. Finish the wizard. 




Remarks:

- If the User Groupware data files have been configured for your client, they must be selected when preparing the setup. Therefore, the list of setup files must be customized.

- If the groupware data files have not been configured, the Supervisor will be the only user in the application the first time it is started.

## Installing an application
<a name="installing_application_ELTTEXTE000147"></a>
Creating an setup program for an application using the user groupware is the same as for any other application: on the "Project" tab, in the "Generation" group, expand "Setup procedure" and select "Create setup procedure".

You can set the path of the groupware files in the setup creation wizard ("Database options" step, "Set the location of the groupware files during setup").

In this case, a screen specific to the User Groupware will be displayed when the application is installed. This screen allows the person who installs the application to:

- configure the location of the data files specific to the User Groupware. 

- enable the history of connections.

- enable user authentication via an LDAP directory. In this case, you will have to enter the address of the server, the port number and the LDAP version used.

Remarks:

- If the User Groupware data files have been configured for your client, they must be selected when preparing the setup. Therefore, the list of setup files must be customized.

- If the groupware files have not been configured, only the "Supervisor" user will exist during the first startup of the application.




**Tip**: If you do not configure the different use levels of user groupware for your clients, we recommend that you provide them with a document listing all the controls found in your windows or pages in order to get an optimized configuration.
