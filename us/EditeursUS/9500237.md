## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000159"></a>
The Real Time Performance Profiler (RTPP) is a tool that helps you identify what is slowing down your application. The RTTP features a real-time application activity chart

The principle is straightforward: 

- Enable the Real Time Performance Profiler.

- Test your window, page or project.  

- During the test, the RTTP collects data on the different processes being executed and shows the activity of the application or site in real time in a chart.

The Real Time Performance Profiler can be launched: 

- **when testing a project (GO)**: 

	1. Open the "Real Time Performance Profiler" pane: On the "Home" tab, in the "Environment" group, expand "Panes", select "Panes", and then select "Real Time Performance Profiler".

	2. Click "Go" in the quick access buttons to test the window, page or project. 

	3. Use the element being tested. The chart appears in the Real Time Performance Profiler. 




- **by attaching to a running executable or website**: 

	1. In the editor, open the project that corresponds to the running executable.  

	2. Open the "Real Time Performance Profiler" pane: on the "Home" tab, in the "Environment" group, expand "Panes", select "Panes", and then select "Real Time Performance Profiler".

	3. Attach to the executable: on the "Project" tab, in the "Test mode" group, expand "Test mode" and select the desired option: 

		- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) To a running executable on the current computer or on a remote computer. 




4. Select the desired executable or site. 

5. Use the features of the application or site. The chart appears in the Real Time Performance Profiler.

1. Time range displayed. 

2. Pause/Resume real-time view button. 

3. Button to set time above which processes will be highlighted (1 second by default). The following colors will be used

- Pastel red for processes above the specifed duration. 

- Pastel blue for processes below the specified duration. 




4. Activity periods chart. 

- The low level indicates that the application is idle, waiting for a user action. 

- The high level indicates that the application is busy, and no longer responds to user actions. 


If the application uses several threads, the different threads are displayed in the chart. 

5. List of functions used during the high level selected in the chart. Functions are displayed in chronological order. The following information is displayed: 

- Date and time of execution. 

- Execution duration. 

- Function name and hierarchy relative to the previous function. 




6. When you hover over a row of the table, a specific menu appears including the following options:
