## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000187"></a>
It is necessary to compile the help to create a file based on the information entered in the help editor. A specific compiler is used for each help format (HTML, HTML Help or PDF). These compilers are provided with WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile.

Compilation is the process that creates the final help file using all the available elements: images, keywords, help pages, etc.

The compilation must be performed:

- to create the help file (CHM, PDF or HTML pages).

- each time the help system is modified (modification of a page, keyword, etc.).




Once the compilation is completed, the help file can be tested.

**Caution**: Before compiling the help, make sure that the compilers provided with WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile are referenced in the [options of the help editor](../Editeurs/2010020.md).

### Defining the default page
<a name="defining_the_default_page_ELTPARAGRAPHE000032"></a>

Before compiling the help system, you must define the default page. This page will be the first help page displayed when the help is started.

To define the default page of the help system: 

1. Go to the characteristics of the help system: on the "Modification" tab, in the "Help system" group, click "Description".

2. In the "General" tab, select the default page.

### Defining the compilation options
<a name="defining_the_compilation_options_ELTPARAGRAPHE000057"></a>

By default, the help is compiled in the format chosen when the help system was created.

To choose the format of the help system, you must define the compilation options:

1. On the "Modification" tab, in the "General" group, click "Options".

2. Select the type of help to generate and specify the generation options if necessary.

### Compiling a help file
<a name="compiling_help_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000091"></a>

To compile a help file: 

1. On the "Modification" tab, in the "General" group, click "Compile". 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=aide_compilation%20-%20HC%20N%B0004%202.gif)
Compilation starts.

2. Once the compilation is completed:

	- If the compiler did not find any errors, the help file opens automatically.

	- If the compiler detects errors, the status report of the compilation is displayed. This status report shows:

		- the warnings: these warnings indicate non-existing links in the help file, for example.

		- the operations performed by the compiler, as well as the errors and problems encountered. The "Print" button is used to print the status report.







To test the help system, click "Test".

### Test of the help system
<a name="test_the_help_system_ELTPARAGRAPHE000123"></a>

The help system can be tested via one of the following methods:

- when compiling the help (see previous paragraph). 

- on the "Modification" tab, in the "General" group, click "Test". This option opens the last created help file. If changes have been made since the last compilation, they are not taken into account.
