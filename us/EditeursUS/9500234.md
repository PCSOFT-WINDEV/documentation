### Project skin template
<a name="project_skin_template_ELTPARAGRAPHE000054"></a>

 The "Style" tab of the project description window allows you to identify and define the skin template used by the project. A preview shows the skin template in use.

Remark: If the skin template is modified via the project description window, this modification is only taken into account for new windows. To apply a skin template to existing windows, go to the "Project" tab, "Other actions" group, and click "Apply a skin template to the project". 

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) The " Info, YesNo, Confirm, and Dialog system windows (WINDEV configurations) " option can be used to customize system information windows, by using the AAFs or by integrating the corresponding windows directly into the project. For more details, see [Customizing the system information windows (or dialog boxes)](../WDLang1/3021003.md).

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) The "Apply the theme of skin template to the components included in the project and to the AAF windows" option makes it possible to use the theme of the project skin template on all the elements that are included in the project: components, specific AAF windows, etc.



![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) The "Tooltip" option is used to define how to display tooltips in your application. By default, the display mode is "Standard". You can customize the tooltips of the application. For more details, see [Custom tooltips](../Editeurs/9500233.md).
