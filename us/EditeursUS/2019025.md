## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000150"></a>
Several test tools are available to guarantee the quality of your applications:

- The test mode (Go on a project or Go on a window) is used to immediately check a modification in your application.




To automate these tests and to increase the quality of your applications, you have the ability to run **automatic unit tests**. These tests are used to easily check all the features proposed by your applications.

Each test contains a scenario that can be directly edited in the product interface. This scenario is written in WLanguage and it can be modified at any time.

These tests can be run before creating the executable in order to check the operating mode of an application.

Remark: The automated tests are taken into account by "[Code coverage](../Editeurs/2019034.md)".

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile allow you to run automated tests on:

- [Windows](../Editeurs/2019026.md).

- [Sets of procedures](../Editeurs/2019027.md).

- [Classes](../Editeurs/2019027.md).

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) [An executable](../Editeurs/2019029.md).




You have the ability to create a test: 

- for a specific window,

- for the entire application,

- not linked to a window, procedure or class.




![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) You also have the ability to import test scenarios created by the users. For more details, see [Automated tests created by the user](../Editeurs/2019031.md).

## Remarks
<a name="remarks_ELTTEXTE000204"></a>


- Each test is associated with a WLanguage code: the test scenario. This scenario can be viewed in the code editor. The code of the tests can be modified.

- The tests (and the associated code) are not included in the executable and they are not given to the users. The number of tests for an application has no incidence on the size of the application supplied to the users.

- The automated tests do not operate on a non-interactive TSE session. 

- The "Tests" widget found in the [Project dashboard](../Editeurs/9500221.md) allows you to quickly find out the percentage of tests passed, not passed, ... It can also be used to run the different tests.
