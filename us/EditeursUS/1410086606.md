## Selection" group functions
<a name="selection_group_functions_ELTTEXTE000359"></a>
The image editor proposes several tools for performing a selection: 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Editeur_image_ruban%20-%20HC%20N%B0001%205.gif)


- **Rectangle**: Used to select a rectangular area in the current layer with the mouse. The move used to represent the area is performed by keeping the left button down. Releasing the left mouse button ends the selection area. The area is represented by a rectangle in dotted line.

- **Lasso**: Used to select any area in the current layer with the mouse. The start point is defined by the left mouse click. The move used to represent the area is performed by keeping the left button down. Releasing the left mouse button ends the selection area. The area is represented by a colored outline. Then, this area can be moved with the move tool.

- **Wand**: Used to select a colored area without having to draw its outline. All you have to do is specify the tolerance for the selections performed with this tool. 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Editeur_Image_baguette%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)
A low tolerance means that the wand will select less colors while a high tolerance means that the wand will cover a wide range of colors. 

- **Move and resize** (Ctrl T): Allows to: 

	- move the content of layer or selected area with the mouse. The move is performed with the mouse by keeping the left button down. Releasing the left mouse button validates the move.

	- resize the content of the layer or selected area with the mouse. The resizing is performed with the mouse, by using the area handles. If the Shift key is held down while resizing, the proportions are retained.

	- perform a rotation of layer or selected area with the mouse. Simply move the mouse away from the area handles to display a rotation cursor (double curved arrow). Then, keep the left mouse button down when rotating the object in the desired direction. Releasing the left mouse button validates the rotation.

## Layers
<a name="layers_ELTTEXTE000527"></a>
The image editor allows you to manage layers, which means different levels on the image. 

These layers can be managed: 

- via the ribbon. 

- via the "Images" pane. 




In the ribbon, the options are as follows: 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Editeur_Image_baguette%20-%20HC%20N%B0005.gif)


- New layer: Used to create a layer on the image. This layer can be created: 

	- blank, 

	- from an image loaded from a directory,

	- from an image loaded from an image catalog. 


The created layer can be handled in the "Images" pane, "Layers" section.

- Duplicate: Duplicates the layers selected in the "Images" pane, "Layers" section.

- Flatten: Merges all the selected layers. It is possible to select a list of layers to merge by using the multi-selection in the list of layers. If one of the selected layers is not visible (grayed eye symbol), an error message is displayed, indicating that the non-visible layers cannot be merged.




The following operations can be performed in the "Layers" section of "Images" pane: 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Editeur_img_calque%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif)


- Make a layer visible or invisible (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Editeur_img_calque%20-%20HC%20N%B0002%201.gif)
),

- Add a new layer (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Editeur_img_calque%20-%20HC%20N%B0002%202.gif)
),

- Delete the selected layer (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Editeur_img_calque%20-%20HC%20N%B0002%203.gif)
),

- Duplicate the selected layer (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Editeur_img_calque%20-%20HC%20N%B0002%204.gif)
),

- Move the selected layer (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Editeur_img_calque%20-%20HC%20N%B0002%205.gif)
),

- Flatten the image (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Editeur_img_calque%20-%20HC%20N%B0002%206.gif)
). 




Each layer includes a context menu allowing you to handle it (duplicate, merge, move, etc.). 

Remark: Ctrl + click allows you to select the most appropriate layer, i.e. the layer that has image content under the mouse cursor. 

The "Visible/Invisible through programming" option allows you to manipulate the layer in the code: This allows you to display the image in an Image control while specifying the layer to be made visible or invisible ([ImageLayerVisible](../WDLang2/1000023504.md)).
Caution: As soon as the option "Visible/Invisible through programming" is enabled for the layers, the ".wdpic" file must be handled via an [WDPic](../WDLang1/1000023503.md) variable.
