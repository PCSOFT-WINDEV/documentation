## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000138"></a>
A window can remain opened indefinitely, waiting for the user to click. In some cases, if the user does not end the current action (modify information about a customer, etc.), the corresponding information may be locked for the other users. 

An 'Automatic validation' button is used to automatically validate (or cancel) an action after a given period of time (between 1 second and 15 minutes). 

This feature is also very useful for the confirmation windows. 

**Reminder**: A timer on button can also be automatically included in the application. For more details, see [Automatic validation](../WDChamp/1013072.md).

### Customizing the setting window of the timer button

WINDEV allows you to include the configuration window of the time button used by the AAF in your application. You will have the ability to customize:

- the appearance of this window (modification of skin template for example).

- the languages supported by this window. This feature is very useful when translating this window into the different languages available in the application.  




**To include the window for configuring the timer in your application**:

1. On the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, expand "Import" and select "WINDEV elements and their dependencies".

2. Select the subdirectory that contains the elements to import. The configuration window of the timer button is in the "Programs\\Data\\Preset windows\\AAF" subdirectory of the WINDEV setup directory.

3. WINDEV lists the elements of the directory. This directory contains the different elements corresponding to the customizable AAFs. The window to import is named "WINDEVAaf_TimerWindow.wdw".

4. Validate. The window is included in the project and it can be modified. This custom window will be automatically taken into account when running the application.




Remarks:

- The window must not be renamed.

- If this window is included in your application, you may not benefit from the improvements made to this window during the different updates. Don't forget to check whether this window has evolved.

- Caution: To modify this window, the corresponding file must not be read-only. Modify the characteristics of the file in Windows if necessary.

### Timer button on the system windows
<a name="timer_button_the_system_windows_ELTPARAGRAPHE000083"></a>

To propose a configurable Timer button on the system windows, it is recommended to check "Customize system windows (Info, YesNo, Confirm, Dialog)" in the "Style" tab of the project description.

**Remark**: If the text of the system window differs from the text displayed when defining the timer button, the timer will not be proposed.
