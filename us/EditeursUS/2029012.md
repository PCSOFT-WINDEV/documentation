The document tabs allow you to navigate between the different elements opened in the different editors. Both the code and the UI appear in these tabs.

Hovering over a tab opens a preview thumbnail: window, report, query, code ....

Each document can be closed by clicking the close icon in the tab or in the preview thumbnail. You can also click the mouse wheel: the hovered element is then closed. 

Each tab has a context menu with several options. The "Close all but this" option is absolutely essential.

If the tabs overflow the available space, they become scrollable: simply use the mouse wheel to scroll through the different elements. You can also drag and drop tabs. 

The list of all open elements can also be displayed in a menu.

Remark: The context menu of the open documents bar (not of an individual tab) allows you to open recently closed elements ("Recently closed" option).
