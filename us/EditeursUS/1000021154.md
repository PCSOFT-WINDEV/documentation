## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000236"></a>
Once the User Groupware is configured, the configuration of users and accesses is performed at runtime, by connecting with a "supervisor" account.

During the first start, you must use the "Supervisor" user and choose a password for this user.

After identification, a user who is the groupware supervisor will have the ability to start the application or to configure the groupware.

The "Configure the groupware" option is used to access the options for managing the User Groupware. You can: 

- [Configure the users and the groups](#NOTE2_1). 

- [Configure the rights](#NOTE3_1). 

- [See the statistics](#NOTE4_1). 

- [Retrieve data coming from a former groupware](#NOTE5_1). 

- [Encrypt the passwords](#NOTE6_1).

## Configuring the users and the groups
<a name="configuring_the_users_and_the_groups_ELTTEXTE000260"></a>
The User Groupware allows you to define groups and users according to simple rules:

- a user can belong to several groups (or to no group).

- a group can have several sub-groups, 

- a group has a single "parent" group.




**To create a user**: 

1. On the right section of the screen, click "Users and groups". Only the "SUPERVISOR" user appears in the table. 

2. Click the "New" button found below the list of users. 

3. In the screen that is displayed, enter the information about the user. 
	Remarks: 

	- Type the password, this one appears hidden. To check the password, simply click the eye icon: the password will remain visible as long as the mouse button is held down. 

	- The new created user can be a "supervisor" user. In this case, he can also create users and configure their rights. 




4. Click "Save". The new user is automatically added to the list of users. 


The "Modify" and "Delete" buttons are used to handle the different users found in the list. 

**To create a group**: 

1. On the right section of the screen, click "Users and groups". Only the "SUPERVISOR" user appears in the table. 

2. Click the "New" button found below the list of groups.

3. Enter the name of the group. 

4. Click "Save". The new group is automatically added to the list of groups. 


The "Modify" and "Delete" buttons are used to handle the different groups found in the list. 

**To associate a user with a group**: 

1. Select the user in the list of users. 

2. Move the user line toward the requested group by Drag and Drop.

**To position a group as sub-group of another group**: 

1. Select the group in the list of groups. 

2. Move the group to the line of the "parent" group by Drag and Drop. 




Creating a "groups/users" hierarchy allows you to define an inheritance in the access rights. For example, in this configuration: 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=gpu_UtilisateurGroupes.gif)


- the "Assistant" group will inherit from the rights granted to the "Sales" group, 

- the usernamed "Louise" will benefit from the access rights granted to the "Assistant" group.

<a name="NOTE3_1"></a>


## Configuring rights
<a name="configuring_rights_ELTTEXTE000284"></a>
The rights can be defined for the the groups and for the users.

Tip: To easily define the access rights, start to define the rights granted to the "parent" groups, then the rights granted to the sub-groups, and finally the rights granted to the users.

**To define the rights**: 

1. In the left section of the screen, click "Manage the rights". The list of groups, sub-groups and users is displayed. 

2. Select the user or the group whose rights must be configured and click "Next". 

3. The definition of rights starts by allowing or denying the access to the windows and reports found in the application: 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=gpu_droit_autoriserInterdir.gif&type=thumb)
The windows and reports of the components used by the application are also displayed in this list. 

4. Simply: 

	- Select the element. 

	- Click the "Allow the access" and "Deny the access" buttons.
			Important: if you deny the access to a window, don't forget to lock all the access means to this window (by graying the relevant buttons, menu options, ...). A fatal error will occur if a user has the ability to open a window for which he does not have access.

	- A icon (displayed in the upper-right corner of each window and report) indicates the access rights for the current window or report. 
			Remarks: 

		- If the access to an element is explicitly allowed ("Allow the access") for a group, it may be denied for a sub-group or for a user of the group. 

		- You have the ability to allow an element that is denied in the "parent" group.




5. If a window or a report is allowed for the group or for the user, you have the ability to define the status of each control, button, menu, menu option, ... via the "Next" button. 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=gpu_param_champ.gif&type=thumb)


	- The status of the element can be the one defined by default in the GUI or a specific status:

	- inactive, 

	- grayed

	- invisible.

6. Validate when the setting is performed.

## Statistics
<a name="statistics_ELTTEXTE000308"></a>
The "Statistics" option is used to get statistics about the connection to one of the applications using the database of user groupware, for a given period.

<a name="NOTE5_1"></a>


## Retrieving data
<a name="retrieving_data_ELTTEXTE000332"></a>
If the user groupware was already included in a project before versions 18, you have two possibilities:

- you want to keep the user groupware as is. To do so, check "Mode compatible with versions 17 and earlier" in the "Integration" tab of the groupware description. 

- you want to benefit from the new features of the new groupware, without losing your existing data. All you have to do is retrieve the data.




To import existing data: 

1. Connect with a user who is supervisor (the "SUPERVISOR" user for example). 

2. In the window for groupware management, click "Retrieve the data". 

3. Select the type of the database that contains the groupware information to import. 

4. Specify:

	- the password of groupware files to import. The password is "PCSGPW2001" if it was not modified.

	- the information for file location (the directories for the files in HFSQL Classic format or the parameters for connecting to the server in the other cases).




5. Validate.

## Encrypt the passwords
<a name="encrypt_the_passwords_ELTTEXTE000356"></a>
If the application was deployed with version 200057 (or later), the "Enable the encryption of passwords" button is displayed in the management window (upper-right corner). ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=GPU_Cryptage.gif)


Pay great attention when enabling the encryption of paswords: 

- The existing passwords will be migrated.

- This operation cannot be undone.

- If the files of user accounts are shared with other applications, all the applications must be updated with version 200057 (or later). Otherwise, you will not be able to connect to the application.




Click the "Enable the encryption of passwords" button to encrypt the passwords. 

A warning message is displayed before performing the encryption of users. Validate. 

Remark: When the passwords have been encrypted, the "Enable the encryption of passwords" button is not available anymore.
