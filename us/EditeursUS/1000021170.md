## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000167"></a>
The User Groupware in automatic mode offers many possibilities. If you want to set the management of users and rights more precisely, WINDEV allows you to customize everything (analysis, windows, code and more)!

## Implementation

### How to?
<a name="how_ELTPARAGRAPHE000018"></a>

To implement the User Groupware in custom mode, you must: 

1. On the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, click "User Groupware". 

2. In the description window of the current project configuration, in "User Groupware: Disabled", click "Change". 

3. In the window that appears, enable the User Groupware. The various tabs in this window allow you to set the the user groupware parameters for your application.. 

4. In the "Options" tab, select the desired customization mode: 

	- Customize login UI (log in, register).

	- Full customization (expert mode). 


 Depending on the customization mode chosen, the integrated elements are different. 

5. Validate. The User Groupware is integrated into your project. 

6. An administrator account will be created during the first execution of application or site under the "supervisor" name. Then, the corresponding password can be specified. 




**Caution**: As soon as the User Groupware is customized in a project, the project will no longer benefit from the evolutions made to the User Groupware. Therefore, it is recommended to switch to "custom" mode with great care and only if you want to make important modifications. Otherwise, it is recommended to use the User Groupware in automatic mode. To retrieve the evolutions made to the groupware, see "Evolutions".

### Customize the login UI: The integrated elements 
<a name="customize_the_login_the_integrated_elements_ELTPARAGRAPHE000050"></a>

When a project uses the user groupware with connection UI customization, an internal Component "WDGPU_WD" is automatically integrated into the project.

This internal Component contains the customizable elements used by the groupware:

- the log-in window ("FEN_GPU_WD_Login"),

- a set of procedures proposing several useful functions. 


All these elements can be modified.

### Full customization: The integrated elements 
<a name="full_customization_the_integrated_elements_ELTPARAGRAPHE000065"></a>

When a project uses the user groupware with full customization, an internal Component "WDGPU" is automatically integrated into the project.

This internal component contains all the elements used by the groupware:

- the identification window ("FEN_GPU_MotPasseExport"),

- the configuration window ("WIN_GPU_Main"), 

- of the requests

- the groupware analysis, 

- a set of procedures proposing several useful functions, 

- a class for context management.


All these elements can be modified: you have the ability to add an item into the "GPU_User" file or to implement checks on some controls for example.

### Example of customization
<a name="example_customization_ELTPARAGRAPHE000084"></a>

the user groupware can be customized to memorize the Country of each user.. 

In this case:

- a " Country " item is added to the "GPU_User" file,

- a edit control " Country " is added in the input form of a user (plane 2 of the "WIN_GPU_Main" window),

### Retrieving the evolutions made to the User Groupware
<a name="retrieving_the_evolutions_made_the_user_groupware_ELTPARAGRAPHE000096"></a>

If you customize the User Groupware, a solution allows you to retrieve the different evolutions made to the User Groupware: perform a comparison between your project that includes your modifications and the same project that includes an internal component without modification.

To do so:

1. Create a copy of your project.

2. In the "copy" project, delete the internal component named "WDGPU".

3. Then, ask to check this component back in via the window for configuring the groupware (open and re-validate the window to force the integration of the internal component).

4. Compare the projects: on the "Project" tab, in the "Other actions" group, expand "Compare" and select "Compare two projects...". Ask to compare the current project and the "copy" project.

5. The "Management/Resolution of differences" window allows you to see all the differences between the elements from your modified internal component and the ones from the "standard" internal component.




You can then easily retrieve the evolutions of the "standard" internal component you are interested in.
