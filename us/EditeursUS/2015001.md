## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000263"></a>
It's possible to print out various technical documentations detailing all the elements (window, page, report, data file, heading, Component, assembly, personal folders, etc.) of the project.

To print this documentation, go to the "![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_imprimer.gif)
" tab, "Home" group and expand the General icon:

- the "Print project technical documentation" option opens the corresponding wizard. You can choose the type of information to be printed. The technical documentation can contain all the characteristics of the project and its elements.

- the "Print" option. The technical documentation then consists solely of the characteristics of the current element (window, report, query, personal folder, project, etc.)..
	If the "Print" option is used on a simple element (the code of an element for example), only this element will be printed. 




**Remarks**: 

- If the print format of the technical documentation is to be changed (from A4 to A3), you can adapt the pages of the documentation to the new format. For more details, see [Print area](../Editeurs/2015001.md).

- The technical documentation cannot be printed in "Reports & Queries".

- In previous versions, the technical documentation was referred to as "programming documentation". 

- When printing WLanguage code from the code editor, a dialog box appears and allows you to: 

	- select the printer to be used

	- choose the paper orientation. 

	- resize printing areas according to the format used by the printer, if necessary.

## Technical documentation of the project

### Type of information to print
<a name="type_information_print_ELTPARAGRAPHE000051"></a>

There are different types of technical documentation:
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Dossier%20du%20projet%20-%20HC%20N%B0001%201.gif)


- Overall: Contains basic information about the project elements.

- Code: Contains all the processes of all the project objects and procedures.

- Complete: Contains all project information. This type of technical documentation can be very large extensive. 

- Custom: Corresponds to a selection of information to print.

### Content of the technical documentation
<a name="content_the_technical_documentation_ELTPARAGRAPHE000064"></a>

The **complete** technical documentation of the project can contain various parts:

- description of the project (elements present in the project, project code, etc.).

- Description of internal components of project.

- description of the analysis (analysis graph, data dictionary, etc.).

- description of windows and/or pages (Image of windows, list of fields present in each window, etc.).

- Description of window templates or page templates

- description reports (Image reports, list of fields present in each report report, etc.).

- Description of report templates.

- description of queries (Image of queries, corresponding SQL code, etc.).

- description of classes (class code, etc.).

- description UML models (Diagram UML graph, Diagram relations list, etc.).

- description flexible modeling (graph, application list, component list, etc.).

- description collections of procedures (code, multilingual messages, perso-notes, etc.).

- Description of automatic tests (code, summary of results).

- description business rules (description, attached files, links, etc.).




**When printing the overall documentation**, only the basic information about the project, windows and or pages, templates and reports is printed.  

**When printing a custom technical documentation**, you can choose the information to print in each part ( "Edit" button).
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Dossier%20du%20projet%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif)

For example, for queries, you can print:

- the graphic representation of queries,

- general information about the queries (logical and physical name of the queries, type of the queries, analysis associated with the queries, etc.)

- information specific to query results (result fields, query parameters, sorting criteria, etc.),

- information on the characteristics of the queries (selection conditions, groupings, etc.),

- the SQL code corresponding to the queries.

- the custom-notes. 

- the business rules.




Regardless of the type of technical documentation chosen, you can also select the different elements of the project to be included. 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Dossier%20du%20projet%20-%20HC%20N%B0001%202.gif)
The "Modify" button allows you to select one or more windows, for example. 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Dossier%20du%20projet%20-%20HC%20N%B0006.gif)
Only information about the selected windows will appear in the documentation.

**Remark**: If the current project contains WINDEV windows, Mobile windows and WEBDEV pages, you can print information about all the project elements, regardless of the product from which the documentation is printed.

**Caution**: If graphical representations (analysis, UML diagrams, etc.) are to be printed, it is necessary to configure the print areas. For more details, see [Print areas](#NOTE4_1).

### Cover and preface of the technical documentation
<a name="cover_and_preface_the_technical_documentation_ELTPARAGRAPHE000114"></a>

You can define a cover and a preface for the technical documentation. 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Dossier%20du%20projet%20-%20HC%20N%B0001%203.gif)

### Specifying the print areas
<a name="specifying_the_print_areas_ELTPARAGRAPHE000186"></a>

If graphical representations (LDMs, UML diagrams, etc.) are to be printed, it is necessary to configure the print fields before printing the technical documentation.

To specify the print areas of current graphic representation:

1. On the "Display" tab, in the "Edit" group, check "Print areas". A series of borders that represent the printable areas in the technical documentation will appear in the current editor.

2. Reduce the display of the graphic representation to view the entire graph: 

	- on the "Display" tab, change the zoom value.

	- press Ctrl + Mouse wheel.




3. With the mouse:

	- move the borders to the desired location by keeping the mouse button down (the mouse cursor is black).

	- choose the number of pages on which the graphic representation must be printed (the mouse cursor turns into a North-West/South-East double arrow).
