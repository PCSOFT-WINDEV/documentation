## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000328"></a>
One major step when developing an application is deploying the application to client computers.

WINDEV optimizes application deployment via multiple options:

- in the setup media. 

- in the tools used to create the setup program. 

- in the different setup modes (single computer or network).

## Setup media
<a name="setup_media_ELTTEXTE000352"></a>
Depending on the setup media used (Internet, in-house network, etc.), WINDEV offers multiple setup generation modes. To optimize your setup, choose the recommended generation mode.


|   |   |   |   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|   |   | **Generation modes of the setup program proposed by WINDEV** |
|   |   | **Self-extracting executable** | **Directory cut to the size of diskettes** | **Single directory** | **CD ROM/DVD ROM** |
| **Setup media** | Internet | **x** (Recommended) |   |   |   |
| CD ROM/DVD ROM |   |   | **x** | **x** (Recommended)<br>Autorun possible |
| In-house network | **x** |   | **x** (Recommended) | **x**  |

## Tools for creating the setup program
<a name="tools_for_creating_the_setup_program_ELTTEXTE000376"></a>
Different tools are available to create, maintain and customize the setup program.

|   | Wizard | WDInst,<br>setup editor | WDSETUP customization |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Create a standard setup program (in French and in English by default) | **X** (recommended) | **X** |   |
| Maintain a setup program | **X** | **X** |   |
| Customize a setup program (the program that is started on the user computer) |   | **X** | **X** (multilingual setup for example) |
| Start mode | On the "Project" tab, in the "Generation" group, expand "Setup procedure" and select "Create setup procedure". | On the "Tools" tab, in the "Utilities" group, click "WDInst". | WDSETUP project available in the "Examples" subdirectory of the WINDEV setup directory |

## Different types of setup
<a name="different_types_setup_ELTTEXTE000400"></a>
Two types of setup are available in WINDEV:

- **"Individual" setup: recommended for the single-user applications**
	The setup program installs the application directly on the client computer.

- **Setup "with automatic update": recommended for the multi-user applications**
	The setup is performed in two steps:

	- The reference application is installed on the server. The reference application corresponds to the setup program of application on the user computers.

	- The final application is installed on each user computer by running the setup program found on the server. The updates will be automatically performed when the reference application changes on the server.
