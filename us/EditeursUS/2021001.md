## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000130"></a>
Copying the style of a control consists in copying the characteristics of a control style to another control. Only the control style is copied (not its content).

This copy can be performed between:

- Two controls of the same type.

- Two controls of different types. In this case, only the style characteristics common to the two controls are copied.




The style copy can be performed between two controls belonging to the same window (to the same page or to the same report) or between two controls belonging to different windows (to different pages or to different reports).

The images displayed in the controls (background image of a button for instance) are not copied along with the control style. The path of the image must be specified in the description of the controls.
