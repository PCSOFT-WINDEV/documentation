## Overview

WDInst allows you to create several types of setup:

- ***Standard setup***: recommended for a single-user application.
	All the files required by the application are installed on the client computers.
	When updating the application, the update program must be run on each user computer.

- ***Network setup with automatic update***: recommended for a multi-user application (used by several users simultaneously). 
	This type of setup allows you to:

	- automatically manage the updates of the application.

	- find out the characteristics of the users connected to the application at a given time, via the "WDADMINEXE" program installed on the server. For more details, see [Checking the WINDEV executables remotely](../WDAdminExe/2028052.md).

	- configure the location of the application files. For example:

		- Install all the application files on the server.

		- Install the database on the server and the files required to run the application (".EXE", ".WDL", ".DLL", etc.) on each client computer.

		- Installing part of the database on the server and another part on each user computer. The files required to run the application (".EXE", ".WDL", ".DLL", etc.) are also installed on each client computer.




- ***Setup from a Private Store***: recommended for grouping applications used within a company. This type of setup allows:

	- Access to application setups through a portal. 

	- Automatic application updates.   




- ***Compact setup***: The size of the generated setup program is optimized in order to be downloaded from Internet.




**Remark**: By default, the setup generated by WINDEV corresponds to a standard setup.

### Defining the type of setup to generate
<a name="defining_the_type_setup_generate_ELTPARAGRAPHE000047"></a>

The type of setup to generate is specified in WDInst. To start WDInst, go to the "Tools" tab, "Utilities" group and click "WDInst".

The setup program creation wizard can also be used to define the type of setup to generate.

<a name="generating_standard_setup_ELTPARAGRAPHE000072"></a>

To generate a standard setup:

1. Select "Setup settings .. Wizard".

2. Check "Standard setup".



<a name="NOTE2_3"></a>


### Generating a setup with update
<a name="generating_setup_with_update_ELTPARAGRAPHE000082"></a>

To generate a setup with update:

1. Select "Setup settings .. Wizard".

2. Check "Network setup with automatic update".

3. Select the reference executable for the network update.

Whenever the application is started on the user computer, the version of the application executable and the version of the reference executable (found on the server) are compared. The application update is proposed if these versions are different. The management of versions is presented in details in the following paragraph. |

**4.** The version number of the application to install is automatically retrieved by WDInst. This number was specified when creating the application executable. 
Enter the version number of the application found on the user computers from which the update will not be mandatory.

**5.** To configure the update of your application more precisely, click the "Advanced options" button. You will have the ability to:

- specify the modification history.

- configure the options for "Remote control of the WINDEV executables".

- modify the conditions for applying the update
