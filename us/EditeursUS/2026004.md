## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000086"></a>
To easily handle large windows (that cannot be entirely displayed in the editor for example), WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile allows you to handle several views of the same window. 

Each view can display a different section of the same window. 

All the modifications performed on one of the views will  be automatically applied to all the opened views.

<a name="how_ELTTEXTE000110"></a>
To display a new view of the current window in the editor, go to the "Display" tab, "Options" group and click "Duplicate display".

To close one of the views, all you have to do is close the corresponding window. 

**Remark**: The views being based on the same file, a single opened element appears in the bar of open elements.
