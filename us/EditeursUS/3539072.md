## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000128"></a>
The configuration diagnostic displays the following error: "Application: Version of the files in the virtual directory".
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WebDev_Virtuel.gif)
This error indicates that the version of the files contained in the virtual directory of the site ("_WEB" directory) does not match the version of the application server.

In most cases, this error is caused by a compilation problem of the site.

**In development**, these versions must correspond exactly:

- The site is compiled by WEBDEV: its files must have the version of WEBDEV.

- During a GO, WEBDEV is using the test application server included in WEBDEV. The version of WEBDEV and the version of the test application server must be identical.

- The version of WEBDEV, the version of the site files and the version of the test application server must be identical.




**In deployment**, the version of the application server must be equal to or greater than the version of the files found in the virtual directory ("_WEB" directory) of the application. 
Remark: The application server is compatible with the earlier versions of WEBDEV (major and minor versions). 



## How do I diagnostic the problem more precisely?

The details of the error is used to find out the version of the site files (version "read") and the version of the application  server ("expected" version). 



## How to fix the problem?
<a name="how_fix_the_problem_ELTTEXTE000176"></a>
To correct the problem, perform the following operations:

- Close all the instances of WEBDEV except the one in which the site is edited. 

- Close all the instances the WEBDEV administrator.

- Recompile the site: on the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, expand "Recompile and synchronize" and select "Recompile project".

- Restart the WEBDEV administrator: on the "Tools" tab, in the "Utilities" group, click "WDFAdmin".

- Check whether the diagnostic is correct.




If the diagnostic still fails on this error:

- Close all the instances of WEBDEV.

- Close all the instances the WEBDEV administrator.

- Make sure that no instance is found in memory (with the task manager for example).

- Start WEBDEV (in the requested version).

- Open project.

- Repair the project: on the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, expand "Recompile and synchronize" and select "Repair project".
