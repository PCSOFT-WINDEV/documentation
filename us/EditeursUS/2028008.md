## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000170"></a>
WINDEV proposes several types of setup for a WINDEV application: 

- [Individual setup](#NOTE2_1).

- Setup with automatic update: 

	- [Network setup](#NOTE2_2).

	- [HTTP setup](#NOTE2_3).

	- [Multisite setup](#NOTE2_4).

	- [Push setup](#NOTE2_5).




- Setup on a Private Store.

## Different types of setup
<a name="different_types_setup_ELTTEXTE000194"></a>


### Individual setup
<a name="individual_setup_ELTPARAGRAPHE000040"></a>

The individual setup consists in creating a setup program that will be installed on each user computer via a setup media.

This setup mode is compatible with: 

- data files in HFSQL Classic format installed on the user computer, 

- data files in HFSQL Classic format installed on a network and accessible from the user computer,

- data files in HFSQL Client/Server format installed on a server. 



<a name="NOTE2_2"></a>


### Network setup (with automatic update)
<a name="network_setup_with_automatic_update_ELTPARAGRAPHE000055"></a>

The network setup consists in creating a setup program that will be installed on a server. 

All the user computers that want to install the application will start the application setup via the network.

If an update is available on the application server, users will be prompted to update the application on startup. 

A network setup allows for an extensive check of the user computers (versions deployed, mandatory updates, disconnection of users, ...). 

This setup mode is compatible with: 

- data files in HFSQL Classic format installed on the user computer, 

- data files in HFSQL Classic format installed on a network and accessible from the user computer,

- data files in HFSQL Client/Server format installed on a server. 




Remark: The setup found on the application server can be updated even if a client application is currently updated.

### HTTP setup (with automatic update)
<a name="http_setup_with_automatic_update_ELTPARAGRAPHE000080"></a>

The HTTP setup consists in creating a setup program that will be installed on a Web server. 

All the user computers that want to install the application will start the application setup via an HTTP URL. 

If an update is available on the Web server, users will be prompted to update the application on startup.

For more details, see [Setup by HTTP (Network setup via IP)](../Editeurs/9000026.md).

### Multisite setup (with automatic update)
<a name="multisite_setup_with_automatic_update_ELTPARAGRAPHE000098"></a>

The multi-site setup allows you to install an application on several different sites (a site can represent a subsidiary for example).

The multi-site setup consists in creating a setup program that will be installed on a Web server.

All the sites that will install the application must start the application setup via an HTTP URL. In this case, the setup program will be installed on a server of the site.

All the user computers that want to install the application will start the setup via the network.

This setup combines the benefits of the network setup and HTTP setup by allowing a large-scale deployment as well as a granular control of local setups.

If an update is available on the Web server, the application is automatically updated on the application server.
<a name="NOTE2_5"></a>


### Push network setup
<a name="push_network_setup_ELTPARAGRAPHE000117"></a>

The network setup consists in creating a setup program that will be installed on a server. The setup will be performed from the server, by the network administrator on the user computers selected by WDAdminExe.

A Push setup can be updated either in Push mode, or as part of a network setup.
