Several steps must be performed to develop an iPhone/iPad application: 

- [Creating and developing the project in WINDEV Mobile](#NOTE2_1). 

- [Generating the application](../Editeurs/1000019908.md). 

- [Compiling in Xcode](../Editeurs/1000019878.md).

### Creating an iPhone/iPad project with WINDEV Mobile
<a name="creating_iphoneipad_project_with_windev_mobile_ELTPARAGRAPHE000028"></a>

To create an iPhone/iPad project with WINDEV Mobile: 

1. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_nouveau.gif)
 in the quick access buttons. 

	- The creation window appears: click "Project". 

	- The project creation wizard starts. 




2. Choose the type of project to create: in our case, select "Android or iOS application". 

3. Go to the next step of the wizard. 

4. Choose the desired platform. For an iOS project, select "iOS only" and go to the next step. 

5. Specify whether the new project should be blank or based on an example. Go to the next step. 

6. The wizard proposes to select the type of devices affected by the project: 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Developper_pour_ios%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)

	Remark: If the application is intended to be used on multiple iOS devices (phones with different screen sizes or resolutions, for example), WINDEV Mobile shows the smallest resolution by default to create the application windows. Using anchors will allow the application to operate on all the devices.

7. Choose the name and location of your project. You have the ability to enter a short description of the project. Go to the next step.
	Remark: no accented character should be used in the project name. 

8. Add (if necessary) design documents to the project. Go to the next step.

9. Specify whether this project must be included in the [Source Code Manager (SCM)](../Editeurs/2038001.md). The Source Code Manager simplifies teamwork and it can also be useful if you are working on your own. Go to the next step.

10. Select the code style of your application. Go to the next step.

11. Select the style book of your application. Go to the next step.

12. Select the supported languages. These languages will be proposed by default as soon as an option of an element (control, window, ...) can be translated. Specify (if necessary) the options that must be taken into account for each language (management of numbers, dates, ....

	- To select the default language displayed in the editor, select the requested language and select "Default language" from the popup menu.

	- To select the default language at runtime, select the requested language and select "Default language at runtime". This language will be used to view the project at runtime.




13. Specify whether the project uses a database. Indeed, the created project can be associated with an analysis. The data files can have the following format: 

	- HFSQL Classic. 

	- HFSQL Client/Server.


 Remark: No accented character should be used in the names of the data files. 

14. The wizard for project creation is over. The wizard for analysis creation is started if the creation of a database was requested. 

15. The method for developing the project is identical to the method for developing a WINDEV Mobile project. However, there are some aspects specific to iOS development. For more details, see [Specific features of iOS applications](../Editeurs/1000019865.md). 




**Remarks**:

- To insert images and icons into your iPhone/iPad applications, the image catalog proposes specific images. All you have to do is select the "iOS" theme during your search. 

- For your iPhone and iPad applications, use the "ActivPhone 4" or "ActivPhone 7" skin template.

- iOS uses character some fonts that are specific to Apple. These fonts are owned by Apple. These fonts can be used in the editor. 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Developper_pour_ios%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif&type=thumb)
 If this font is not available in Windows and it is selected by a control found in an iOS window, a substitution font will be temporarily used for the display in the editor and in the simulator of the development computer. The Apple font will be used when running the application.

- Caution: The iOS projects are in "Unicode" mode. The line of code: 
	
	```wl
	MyString is string
	```
means that MyString is a Unicode string.
