## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000268"></a>
The network setup via HTTP consists in installing and updating a WINDEV application via an HTTP server (Live update). This server can be a Windows server or a Linux server.

Only the reference version of application is installed on the server. The reference application corresponds to the setup that will be run by the end users.

During a first setup, the end user installs his application via Internet, via a specific page.

Whenever the application is run, an HTTP request is automatically performed to check whether the application was updated on the server. If an update is available, the application will be automatically updated.

### Creating a setup via an HTTP access
<a name="creating_setup_via_http_access_ELTPARAGRAPHE000024"></a>

To create a setup via an HTTP access: 

1. Create the application executable: click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_generation_exe.gif)
 in the quick access buttons.

2. Start creating the setup procedure: on the "Project" tab, in the "Generation" group, expand "Setup procedure" and select "Create setup procedure". 

3. In the wizard, click "2 - Setup" and select "Access the setup options".

4. Choose "Setup with automatic update (Live Update)" and select "Setup by HTTP (on owner server or in the CLOUD)".

5. The different types of deployment are presented: 

	- Create a deployment package. This option is used to perform a setup on an HTTP(S) server or in the CLOUD for PC SOFT applications. 

	- Deploy on the CLOUD immediately. This option is used to deploy the application in the CLOUD for PC SOFT applications and it requires the identifiers of the CLOUD platform created beforehand.




6. Select "Create a deployment package". 

7. Specify the parameters for HTTP deployment. You can: 

	- Use a **secure connection or not**. You can: 

		- define the type of connection when installing the reference version on the server. 

		- use a secure connection only. 




- Use **authentication parameters**. You can: 

	- define the authentication parameters when installing the reference version on the server. 

	- use a connection with authentication only. In this case, the end user will have to type a login and password to connect to the HTTP server and to install his update. 

8. Follow the different wizard steps and validate the creation of setup program. For more details, see [Setup wizard: The steps for creating the setup of a WINDEV application](../Editeurs/2028062.md).

### Installing the reference version on the HTTP server
<a name="installing_the_reference_version_the_http_server_ELTPARAGRAPHE000074"></a>

Once the setup procedure is created, you have the ability to run the setup program. This program can also be run directly via the INSTALL.EXE file.

**When running the setup program**, the wizard proposes to:
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Install_IP_Assistant_Instcl.gif)


- deploy the application locally, on the current computer.

- deploy the application remotely, on the HTTP server (at the hosting company). 

- deploy the setup in the PC SOFT cloud.




**Case #1: Deploying the application locally, on the current computer**. 
This setup mode is not available during the setup on a Linux server.

- If an HTTP server is installed on the current computer, this server is configured and the files of the reference application are copied into the specified directory.

- If no HTTP server is installed on the current computer, a default server is installed (WDADMINEXE) and automatically configured. The files of reference application are installed in the specified directory.![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Install_IP_Assistant_Ins3.gif)

	In the setup options, if you have specified that: 

	- the type of connection is defined during the setup, a combo box allows you to specify the protocol used. 

	- the authentication choice is performed during the setup, you have the ability to specify that an authentication is required.   

	- a specific external address must be used, this address is selected in the "Access IP address" control. 





Click "Next".

**Case #2: Deploying the application remotely, on the HTTP server** (at the hosting company). In this case, an FTP connection must be used to send the elements to the server.

- Type the URL of your site at the hosting company: this information corresponds to the address that will be entered by the users to access the setup page of your application. The setup of the reference application will be found at this URL.
	In the setup options, if you have specified that: 

	- the type of connection is defined during the setup, a combo box allows you to specify the type of address (http or https). 

	- the authentication choice is performed during the setup, you have the ability to specify that an authentication is required.




- Enter the characteristics of the FTP server that will be used to install the reference application on the HTTP server.  ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Install_IP_Assistant_Ins2.gif)

### Updating the application
<a name="updating_the_application_ELTPARAGRAPHE000138"></a>

To update your application:

1. Create the application executable: click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_generer.gif)
 in the quick access buttons.

2. Start creating the setup procedure: on the "Project" tab, in the "Generation" group, expand "Setup procedure" and select "Create setup procedure".

3. In the wizard, click "2 - Setup" and select "Access the setup options".

4. Choose "Setup with automatic update (Live Update)" and select "Setup by HTTP (on owner server or in the CLOUD)". 

5. Validate the creation of setup program.

6. Install the reference version on the server.




Once the reference version is updated on the server, the applications of the end users will be updated according to the specified update options (during their next start by default).

## Remarks
<a name="remarks_ELTTEXTE000328"></a>


### Updating the end-user computer
<a name="updating_the_enduser_computer_ELTPARAGRAPHE000170"></a>

According to the options for update management (whenever the application is started by default), an HTTP request is sent to the server to check whether the reference application was modified since the last update. In case of modification, the application update is automatically proposed to the end user.
<a name="NOTE3_2"></a>


### Protocols used
<a name="protocols_used_ELTPARAGRAPHE000177"></a>

The setup and the updates of the reference application on the server are performed by the FTP protocol.

The setup and the updates of the application on the end-user computers from the reference application are performed: 

- by the HTTP protocol. 

- by the HTTPS protocol.




The HTTP requests download the files (".tmp", ".net" and ".zip" extensions) from the server. Therefore, these extensions must be accepted by the Web server that is hosting the reference application. For more details, see [FAQ #3102](https://faq.pcsoft.fr/faqread.awp?idfaq=3102&lang=us).

### How to transform a network application into a network application by HTTP
<a name="how_transform_network_application_into_network_application_http_ELTPARAGRAPHE000196"></a>

The application must be re-installed on the end-user computer.
<a name="NOTE3_4"></a>


### Download page
<a name="download_page_ELTPARAGRAPHE000203"></a>

When the application is deployed, an HTML page is automatically created with a link to the client application setup file (Install.exe).

You can reuse this page and customize it to your needs, for example: 

- by modifying the HTML page on the web server after it has been deployed,

- by customizing the template page in WINDEV on the development computer. Thus, all setups generated afterwards will use this custom page. You can find the template page ("InstIP.html") in "\\Programs\\Data\\Models\\WDInst\\InstIP\\Standard\\" in the WINDEV setup directory.




You can move this page to the server to integrate it into a static site, for example. To do so, update the download link of the page.
<a name="NOTE3_5"></a>


### Managing a proxy server
<a name="managing_proxy_server_ELTPARAGRAPHE000217"></a>

You have the ability to deploy an HTTP setup on a network that uses a proxy. 

The application setup and updates on the client computers will automatically use the proxy without having to perform any additional configuration.
