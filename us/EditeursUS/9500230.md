## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000264"></a>
Git is a source code manager.

Git can be used within a company on its own servers, without anyone outside having access to it.

GitHub is a hosting company that offers Git repository hosting (it is the most well-known hosting company, now owned by Microsoft).

Starting with version 25, the environment allows you to save projects, windows, pages, reports, classes, sets of procedures and code in a Git repository.

This feature allows you to share source elements through GitHub, for example.

Caution: This documentation only describes how to share projects via Git with WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile . The reader is supposed to know and master Git beforehand. This help page does not describe how to use Git. For more details on Git, please refer to their documentation.

## How to share a WINDEV/WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile project via Git?
<a name="how_share_windevwebdev_windev_mobile_project_via_git_ELTTEXTE000288"></a>


### Prerequisite
<a name="prerequisite_ELTPARAGRAPHE000028"></a>

To share a WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile project via Git, this project must not be in the SCM. 
<a name="NOTE2_2"></a>


### Preparing the project
<a name="preparing_the_project_ELTPARAGRAPHE000035"></a>

To share a WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile project via Git: 

1. Open your project in the corresponding product. 

2. Change the save format of all project elements: 

	- Open the project description window: on the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, click "Description". 

	- In the "Options" tab of the project description window, for "Save format", select "Text". 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Projet_Git_2%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif&type=thumb)

			This option allows you to change the format of all project elements to text, a format compatible with Git.

	- Validate. 


 **Remarks**: 

- For each element of your project, you can check or change the save format via the "Format" option in the element description window. 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Projet_Git_2%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif&type=thumb)

3. To ignore project-specific files (compilation files, etc.), copy the ".gitignore" file to your project directory. ".gitignore" is located in the "Personal" subdirectory of the WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile installation directory. 

4. Close your project. 




A Git repository can be created for the project.

### Adding the project to Git
<a name="adding_the_project_git_ELTPARAGRAPHE000078"></a>

You cannot add projects to Git directly from WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile. To add a project to Git, follow the standard procedure. 
<a name="NOTE2_3"></a>


### Opening (cloning) the Git project in WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile
<a name="opening_cloning_the_git_project_windev_webdev_windev_mobile_ELTPARAGRAPHE000087"></a>

To open (clone) a Git project from WINDEV: 

1. In the home window, click "Git...". 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Projet_Git%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif&type=thumb)


2. In the window that appears, specify: 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Projet_Git%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif)


	- The URL of the Git project to clone. 

- The directory where the project should be cloned. Caution: this directory must be empty. 

- The branch, if necessary. 

3. Click "Clone". The project is automatically cloned. 

4. The project appears in WINDEV, WEBDEV, WINDEV Mobile and a specific "Git" pane is displayed in the ribbon. 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Projet_Git%20-%20HC%20N%B0004.gif&type=thumb)





Remark: SSH connection: 
You can connect to a Git server using SSH: 

- Generate a "SSH private/public key" set and supply the public key to Git (for example, using the Github documentation: https://docs.github.com/fr/authentication).  

- Open a Git project from WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile. In " URL of Git project to clone ", indicate the SSH address provided by GitHub (for example: git@github.com:xxxxx/GitTestProject.git) and then click "Clone". 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Git_ssh1.gif&type=thumb)


- In the login window, specify the path of the private key present on the computer and the associated password. 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Git_ssh2.gif&type=thumb)



Authentication will no longer be required until the next time WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile is started..

### Working on the project
<a name="working_the_project_ELTPARAGRAPHE000124"></a>

You can work on a shared project via Git with WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile as usual. In this case, you can modify: 

- an element saved in text mode (window, report, etc.). 

- an element saved in binary mode (project). 




Before making any changes, it is recommended to retrieve the latest version of the project and its elements ("Pull" option in the ribbon). 

**1. Modifying an element available in text format (window, etc.)**
The change is applied in the Git project opened in WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile. The text file corresponding to the element consists of two parts: 

- A "readable" text part: this part corresponds to the code of the elements. 

- A "binary" text part: this part corresponds to all the other characteristics of the element. 




**When the element is modified in the**project, you can then "Commit" the element and then "Push" the project to the repository: 

- "Commit" the element to save the changes made. 
	If multiple elements are modified, you can also commit all the elements of the project.  

- "Push" to send changes to the remote Git repository. All the elements of the project are pushed .  




Several cases may occur: 

- the element has been modified by only one person. No specific action required. The push is automatically completed. 

- the element has been modified by several people: 

	- the changes do not apply to the same element (e.g., changes made in text mode by one developer and in binary mode by another). No specific action required. The push is automatically completed.

	- the changes apply to the same element (e.g., changes made in text mode only): a "merge" must be performed. A "push" is the necessary, in order to identify and process the differences. In this case, a merge window is displayed, allowing you to merge changes. 
			Remark: Control properties are segmented. This reduces conflicts due to concurrent modifications.







**2. Modifying the project**
Several actions can modify the project: 

- adding or deleting elements,

- ...




To take into account the changes made to the project, simply make a "Commit" and a "Push".

### Ribbon options
<a name="ribbon_options_ELTPARAGRAPHE000171"></a>

The Git ribbon panel allows you to: 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Projet_Git%20-%20HC%20N%B0005.gif&type=thumb)


- perform operations on all the elements of the project:

	- Pull to retrieve the remote repository,

	- Commit to update the local repository. 
			 A window lists the modified files to be updated. From this window, you can make a "commit" or "commit & push". 

	- Push to update the remote database. 

	- Revert to revert commits. 
			A window lists the different elements on which the "revert" operation can be made. 

	- The project history allows you to view the different revisions with the list of changes made in each revision. 




- perform operations on the current element in the editor: 

	- Commit to update the local repository. 
			 A window lists the modified files to be updated. From this window, you can make a "commit" or "commit & push". 

	- Revert to revert commits. 
			A window lists the different elements on which the "revert" operation can be made. 

	- Compare to view the differences of a given element with the latest version in the repository. 

	- The history shows the different revisions of the element and their details. 




- perform branch operations directly in the editor. You can:  

	- Create a branch.
			A window allows you to enter the name of the new branch, and to specify whether the branch should be used. The branch will be created from the last commit. 

	- Switch branches.
			A window allows you to indicate the branch to be used. 

	- merge branch. 
			In the window that appears, you can: 

		- select the branch to merge,

		- specify the merge options (do not commit after merge, no fast-forward or fast-forward only). 

		- specify the merge message.
