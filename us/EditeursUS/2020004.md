	<B><B>Warning</B></B>

	From version <B><B>16</B></B>, the creation of batch processes is kept for backward compatibility. 
We recommend that you use the software factory to automate the process for creating applications. For more details, see [Software Factory](../Editeurs/1000019563.md).

## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000178"></a>
WINDEV and WEBDEV allow you to perform multiple types of processes from a command line

You can:

- Compile and generate the executable (EXE) associated with one or more projects.

- Create the library (WDL) associated with one or more projects.

- Generate the components (WDK) associated with one or more projects.






**Remark**: You also have the ability to perform multi-project batch processes. In this case, you have the ability to configure the different operations performed during the compilation or when creating the executable. For more details, see [Multi-project batch processes](../Editeurs/2020013.md).

## How to?
<a name="how_ELTTEXTE000202"></a>


### Principle
<a name="principle_ELTPARAGRAPHE000041"></a>

All you have to do is create a text file containing the full path of the projects corresponding to the action to perform. This text file has the following format:


```txt
C:\My Projects\My Sales Management\Customer\Customer.WDP
C:\My Projects\My compatibility\Compatibility.WDP
```


Then, specify via a command line the action to perform on the projects referenced in this file (see the following paragraphs for more details).

### Generating executables automatically
<a name="generating_executables_automatically_ELTPARAGRAPHE000054"></a>

To automatically generate the executables:

1. Create the Text file containing the path of the projects for which the executables must be created.

2. Run the following command line: WINDEV28.EXE /CREATEEXE=&lt;Path of Text file&gt;
	For example: WINDEV28.EXE /CREATEEXE="C:\\Temp\\Test.txt"

3. The corresponding editor is automatically started. Each project specified in the text file is opened and compiled, then the executable is created with all the options selected by default (or with the options selected during the last creation of the executable for this project.). The editor automatically closed once the executable is generated.




For more details on the different steps to generate an executable file, see [Creating an executable](../Editeurs/2025002.md).

### Creating the main library of the application automatically 
<a name="creating_the_main_library_the_application_automatically_ELTPARAGRAPHE000076"></a>

To automatically create the main library of the application:

1. Create the Text file containing the path of the projects for which the library must be created.

2. Run the following command line:
	WINDEV28.EXE /CREATEWDL=&lt;Path of Text File&gt;
	For example: WINDEV28.EXE /CREATEWDL="C:\\Temp\\Test.txt"

3. Each project specified in the text file is opened and compiled, then the main library is created with all the options selected by default (or with the options selected during the last creation of the library for this project.). The editor is automatically closed once the library is created.

4. The corresponding editor is automatically started. Each project specified in the text file is opened and compiled, then the main library is created with all the options selected by default (or with the options selected during the last creation of the library for this project.). The editor is automatically closed once the library is created.

### Generating a component from a project automatically:
<a name="generating_component_from_project_automatically_ELTPARAGRAPHE000101"></a>

To automatically generate a component from a project:

1. Create the Text file containing the path of the projects for which the associated component must be created. If the project is associated with several components, only the first component will be generated.

2. Run the following command line:

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) In WINDEV:
			WINDEV28.EXE /CREATEWDK=&lt;Path of Text File&gt;
			For example: WINDEV28.EXE /CREATEWDK="C:\\Temp\\Test.txt"




3. The editor is automatically started. Each project specified in the text file is opened and compiled, then the first component found associated with the project is generated with all the options selected by default (or with the options selected during the last generation of the component for this project). The editor is automatically closed once the component is generated.




For more details on the different steps to generate a component, see [Creating a component](../Editeurs/2014002.md).
