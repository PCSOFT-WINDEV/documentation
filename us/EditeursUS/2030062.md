## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000156"></a>
Many devices can be used to display websites (Phone Android, iPhone, ...), and the screen sizes of these devices are often smaller than those of desktop computers.

It's possible to manage the display on mobile devices thanks to layouts, zoning, etc.

WEBDEV also allows you to define the mobile display mode for each Page on the site.. We can also create specific sites for Apple Mobile (iPad or iPhone).

Remark: WINDEV Mobile allows you to create applications for iPhone and iPad. For more details, see [Developing an application for iPhone or iPad](../Editeurs/1000019818.md).

## How to?
<a name="how_ELTTEXTE000180"></a>
To develop sites for specific platforms, the following operations must be performed in each page of the site: 

1. Open the page description window: on the "Page" tab, in the "Description" group, click "Description".

2. In the " UI " tab, set :

### Specific programming features
<a name="specific_programming_features_ELTPARAGRAPHE000086"></a>

The method for developing a site for iPhone is identical to the method for developing a standard site. Some programming features are specific to the development for iPhone.

You have the ability to **make a phone call directly from a site**: in the URL of the link used to make the phone call, specify "tel:" and the phone number.

For example:


```wl
// Téléphone
MAP_TELEPHONE.URL = "tel:" + CLIENT.Téléphone
```


You also have the ability to display the Google Maps corresponding to the address of the customer directly from his form: in the URL of the link, specify "http://maps.google.com/maps?q=" followed by the address of the customer. 
For example:


```wl
// Géolocalisation
MAP_TGMAP.URL = "http://maps.google.com/maps?q=" + ...
	URLEncode(Client.Adresse + " " + Client.Ville + ", " + Client.Pays)
```

### Tips
<a name="tips_ELTPARAGRAPHE000105"></a>

- Use iPhone-specific page templates.

- Reduce as much as possible the weight of the images on the site. Large images, Flash animations or videos may slow down the page loading time.

- Use anchors to manage the different orientations of the iPhone.
