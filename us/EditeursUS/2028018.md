## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000197"></a>
The automatic modification of data files is used to update the description of data files found on the user computers.

For more details, see [Automatic data file modification](../WDLang4/3044195.md).

## Configuring the automatic modification of data files in WDInst
<a name="configuring_the_automatic_modification_data_files_wdinst_ELTTEXTE000221"></a>
The automatic modification of data files must be configured:

- in the setup options ("Setup settings .. HFSQL files").

- in the description of each ".EXE" file that uses data files to be modified ("File description" window), 




To discover the different elements in the WDInst UI, see [WDInst interface](../Editeurs/2028022.md)

The following paragraphs present the automatic modification in the following cases:

- the automatic modification of data files in HFSQL Classic format.

- the automatic modification of data files in Hyper File 5.5 format or the migration of data files from Hyper File 5.5 to HFSQL Classic.

### Performing the automatic modification of data files in WINDEV format
<a name="performing_the_automatic_modification_data_files_windev_format_ELTPARAGRAPHE000042"></a>

To perform the automatic modification of data files in WINDEV format:

1. Select "Setup settings .. HFSQL files".

2. Check "Run the automatic data modification". 

3. Specify the operating mode of the automatic data modification:

	- "Automatic data modification without GUI" enables the automatic data modification without allowing any action from the user. 
			This option is offered by Default when the application's setup program is configured via wizard. 

	- the option "Ask for confirmation before running the automatic data modification" is used to display the list of modified data files and to ask the end user for confirmation. 

	- the option "Display the advanced options of the automatic data modification" is used to display a specific window to the end user (see [Updating with automatic modification of data files](#NOTE3_1)). 




4. Specify (if necessary) the password associated with the analysis. 

5. Validate the window for setup options. 

6. In the "List of setup files" window, select the executable file (".EXE") on which the automatic modification of data files must be performed. In the "HFSQL" tab, check the option "Manage automatic data modification".. 

7. Click the "Advanced" button.

8. Select (if necessary) the analysis in WINDEV format (".WDD" file) associated with the application.

9. For each data file of the analysis, specify (if necessary) the password of the data file (if it exists). 
	To modify this password, check "Modify the password" and type the new password twice.


**Remark**: If the automatic modification is to be performed on data files used by several ".EXE" files, repeat the operations for all ".EXE" files concerned.

### Performing the automatic modification of data files in Hyper File 5.5 format or migrating data files from Hyper File 5.5 to HFSQL Classic
<a name="performing_the_automatic_modification_data_files_hyper_file_55_format_migrating_data_files_from_hyper_file_55_hfsql_classic_ELTPARAGRAPHE000080"></a>

To perform the automatic modification of data files in Hyper File 5.5 format or to migrate Hyper File 5.5 data files to HFSQL Classic , the operations concerning the options of setup are identical. 

In the "setup file list" window: 

1. Select the executable file (type ".EXE") on which the automatic data files are to be modified.

2. In the "HFSQL" tab: 

	- Check "Manage the automatic data modification".

	- Check "Manage the existence of files in Hyper File 5.5 format".

	- Click the "Advanced" button.




3. Select the analysis in HFSQL Classic format (".WDD" file) associated with the application.

4. For each data file of analysis, specify if necessary:

	- the password of the data file (if it exists) in the analysis in WINDEV format.
			Remark: To modify this password, check "Modify the password" and type the new password twice.

	- if the application uses a migrated WINDEV 5.5 analysis:

		- the source analysis in Hyper File 5.5 format (".WDA" file).

		- the name of the data file in the analysis in WINDEV 5.5 format.

		- the password of the data file (if it exists) in the analysis in WINDEV 5.5 format.







**Remark**: If the automatic modification is to be performed on data files used by several ".EXE" files, repeat the operations for all ".EXE" files concerned.

## Updating an application with automatic modification of data files
<a name="updating_application_with_automatic_modification_data_files_ELTTEXTE000263"></a>
When installing an update with automatic modification of data files, you can give the user the ability to configure the automatic modification: an "Advanced options" button is then displayed on the foreground of the setup program . The following window is displayed: 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Param%E9trer_modif_auto_des_fichiers%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif&type=thumb)
This window is used to:

- create a report file for the operations performed by the automatic data modification. If a problem occurs, this file can be given to the application manager. 
	By default, this file is named "LOGMODAUTO.TXT" and it is created in the setup directory of the application.

- list the data files in HFSQL format onto which the automatic modification will be performed. You will have the ability to add to this list:

	- additional data files.

	- additional directories containing data files.




- specify additional directories containing data files in Hyper File 5.5 format that are not automatically found during the update.




**Remark**: During the update, the data files automatically found are:

- the files found in the setup directory of the application.

- the files listed in the ".REP" file. For more details, see the help about the [management of .REP files](../WDLang4/3044186.md).




To prevent the user from accessing the options used to configure the automatic modification, the setup editor WDInst allows you to make the "Advanced" button invisible in the setup program.

### Making the "Advanced" button invisible
<a name="making_the_advanced_button_invisible_ELTPARAGRAPHE000141"></a>

To make the "Advanced" button invisible:

1. Select "Setup settings .. HFSQL files".

2. Check "Automatic data modification without GUI".
