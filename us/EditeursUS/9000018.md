| HFSQL Client/Server or network | **Direct access with the Hxx or SQLxx functions** with the following DLLs in the runtime directory:<br><br>- wd280hf.dll<br><br>- wd280jav.dll<br><br>- wd280sql.dll<br><br>- wd280vm.dll<br><br><br>Depending on the features used, the following libraries may also be required: wd280pnt.dll, wd280trs.dll, wd280uni.dll.<br><br>These libraries are available in the "Programs" subdirectory of WINDEV.<br><br>**Java applet**: the .dll cannot be included in the applet (they must be installed or downloaded automatically). | **Direct access with the Hxx or SQLxx functions** with the following libraries in the runtime directory:<br><br>- wd280hf.so<br><br>- wd280jav.so<br><br>- wd280sql.so<br><br>- wd280vm.so<br><br><br>Depending on the features used, the following libraries may also be required: wd280pnt.so, wd280trs.so, wd280uni.so.<br><br>These libraries are available in the "Programs\\Framework\\Linux" subdirectory of WINDEV.<br><br>**Java applet**: the .so cannot be included in the applet (they must be installed or downloaded automatically). | **Direct access with the Hxx or SQLxx functions** with the following libraries in the runtime directory:<br><br>- wd280hf.dylib<br><br>- wd280jav.dylib<br><br>- wd280sql.dylib<br><br>- wd280vm.dylib<br><br><br>These libraries are available in the "Programs\\Framework\\MacOSX" subdirectory of WINDEV.<br><br>**Java applet**: the .dylib cannot be included in the applet (they must be installed or downloaded automatically). |
| **Note**:<br><br>- For a direct access to an HFSQL Classic Network database, the data must be found on the local network. The data cannot be found on a Windows share accessible from the Mac.<br><br>- For a HFSQL Client/Server database, the data can be found locally or remotely.<br><br><br> |
| Native MySQL, SQL Server or SQLite Access | **Direct access possible with the Hxxx or SQLxxx functions** (no DLL on the user computer) | **Direct access possible with the Hxxx or SQLxxx functions** (no .so on the user computer) | **Direct access possible with the Hxxx or SQLxxx functions** (no .dylib on the user computer) |
| Notes: <br>- The JDBC driver must be included in the archive<br>- Make sure that the JDBC driver is compatible with Windows | Notes: <br>- The JDBC driver must be included in the archive<br>- Make sure that the JDBC driver is compatible with Linux | Notes: <br>- The JDBC driver must be included in the archive<br>- Make sure that the JDBC driver is compatible with Mac |
| Any database that includes a JDBC driver | Direct access possible with the SQLxxx functions only (no DLL on the user computer) | Direct access possible with the SQLxxx functions only (no .so on the user computer) | Direct access possible with the SQLxxx functions only (no .dylib on the user computer) |

Some important points regarding the access to data from a Java application in WINDEV:  

- The execution performed in test mode is not a Java execution but a Windows execution. Therefore, a different connection must be established depending on whether the test mode is used or not (for example: OnTestMode()=True).

- The RMI and JDBC connections cannot be defined in the analysis. These connections must necessarily be defined through programming ([SQLConnect](../WDLang4/3072005.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md)).

- The main differences between Java Archive, Java and Java Web Start Archive are as follows:

	- Java Archive ~= Java application to run/install on a user computer. 

	- Java Applet ~= Java application to run via a Web page in a Web browser.

	- Java Web Start Archive ~= Java application run from a Web page but that is run locally like a standard Java application but with a system for automatic Java Web Start update.
