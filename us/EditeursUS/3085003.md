## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000144"></a>
The different editors in WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile include many options that can be used directly via keyboard shortcuts. 

Most shortcuts are widely used as standard shortcuts in many other programs, for example:

- Ctrl + S to save a document,

- Ctrl + A to select the content of a document,

- Ctrl + F to search, etc.


WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile also include many shortcuts for actions that are specific to each editor. 

For higher productivity and better workflow in the editor, you can customize most default shortcuts by changing the key combination associated with an action. You can also associate a key combination with an action that does not have one.
