<a name="dim_window_inactive_ddw_ELTPARAGRAPHE000082"></a>

Your application opens several windows at the same time and you don't know which one to use?

The inactive windows can be automatically dimmed. This feature allows you to always know which window to use.

This feature is called DDW, which stands for Dim Disabled Windows.

For example: 
![You modify the information regarding a customer
and you click the "Validate" button.](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Grisage%20automatique%20des%20fenetres%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)
![A window prompts you to confirm or cancel the changes.
The main window (in the background) has become unavailable.
It is automatically dimmed. 
You immediately identify the window that must be used.](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Grisage%20automatique%20des%20fenetres%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif)
Several options can be used to dim the current window. 
These options are as follows: 

- **Dim window if inactive (DDW)**: This option is used to gray (or not) the inactive windows. This option is valid for the current window only.

- **Increase DDW rate**: This option is used to display a progress bar indicating the current rate of gray for the inactive windows. You can increase this rate by pressing Ctrl + Alt + '+' on the numeric keypad. This rate of gray will be valid for the entire application.

- **Reduce DDW rate**: This option is used to display a progress bar indicating the current rate of gray for the inactive windows. You can decrease this rate by pressing Ctrl + Alt + "-" on the numeric keypad. This rate of gray will be valid for the entire application.
