A query with parameters is a query for which the sort items and the selection criteria are not fixed. The values of parameters are initialized through programming. At runtime, the result will depend on the value given to the parameters.  

For example, a query with parameters can be used to select the orders placed by a specific customer. The user will only have to select the customer name. The query will use this name as parameter.

**To include a query with parameters in a WINDEV application, WINDEV Mobile application or WEBDEV site**, you must:

- Create a query (in the query editor or through programming). 

- Create a condition and/or a sort.  

- Define the parameter. 

- [Modify the application in order to use the query with parameters](../Editeurs/2032032.md).




The query with parameters can be used with: 

- a window or page control (Table, List Box or Combo Box control),

- a report,

- through programming.
