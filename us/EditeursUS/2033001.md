### Overview
<a name="overview_ELTPARAGRAPHE000025"></a>

The online help is common to all products: WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile. 

The **local help** is proposed by default (by using the files installed on the development computer). It is displayed in a specific help browser.

If your computer is equipped with an Internet access, the help page currently found in the "Help browser" can be displayed in its Internet version ("View the corresponding page on Internet" link).

The Internet online help is available from any computer equipped with an Internet access, without the product being necessarily installed. This help is updated on a regular basis. 

Users can add comments on the documentation pages: personal notes, examples, links and more.


### How to display the help

The help can be accessed from the editor: on the "Home" tab, in the "Online help" group, expand "Help". The following options are available: 

- "Help index". This option is used to access the help pages via the keywords that have been defined on these pages. 

- "Summary". This option is used to access the information classified by theme. Each theme can be "expanded".

- "Find in the help...". This option is used to perform a search on all help pages accessible from this file. All you have to do is type the sought expression. This expression will be sought in all help pages. All the pages containing the specified words are listed and they can be displayed.




Additionally, at any time, you can press F1 or click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=BTN_Aide.Gif)
