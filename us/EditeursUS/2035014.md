### Creating a state-transition diagram
<a name="creating_statetransition_diagram_ELTPARAGRAPHE000057"></a>

To create a state-transition diagram: 

1. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_nouveau.gif)
 in the quick access buttons. 

	- The new element window appears: click "Architecture", and then "UML".

	- The UML model creation wizard starts.




2. Select "State-transition diagram".

3. Specify the UML model into which the diagram is to be inserted.

4. Choose to edit the diagram directly.

5. Validate the new state-transition diagram. The new model appears in the editor.

To create a synchronization bar: 

1. On the "State-transition diagram" tab, in the "Creation" group, click "Synchronization bar". A new synchronization bar appears in the UML model.

2. The context menu (right click) of the synchronization bar is used to:

	- change the orientation of the bar.

	- change the color of the bar.

To create a superstate: 

1. On the "State-transition diagram" tab, in the "Creation" group, click "Superstate". A new superstate appears in the UML model.

2. Right-click the new superstate and select "Description" in the context menu. The superstate description window opens.

3. Specify:

	- the type of the superstate.

	- the name of the superstate. This name is displayed in the UML editor.
