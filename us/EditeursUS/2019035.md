## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000113"></a>
It is increasingly common for developers to test websites on mobile devices. WEBDEV allows you to test projects and pages directly on a mobile device. 

This makes it possible to ensure pages are mobile friendly.

- The mobile device and the development computer must be connected to the same network (Wi-Fi, for example).

- The web server must allow several simultaneous connections. This test mode is not available if you use the built-in IIS Express server.
