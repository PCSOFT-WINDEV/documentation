## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000141"></a>
WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile propose different modes for using the development environment.

The following choices are proposed when the product is started for the first time:

- **Retrieve the configuration of the environment from an earlier version**. This option allows you to easily restore all your settings performed in an earlier version installed on your computer.

- **Simplified environment**. This option is recommended to discover WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile. Some advanced features are not displayed in the environment (SCM, Control Centers, Business Rules, ...). These features can be re-enabled at any time if necessary.

- **Full environment**. This option allows you to use an exhaustive environment. Some options rarely used in the earlier versions are replaced by new features.




You also have the ability to choose the screen configuration:

- ***single-screen***: the different panes will be displayed on the same screen as the development environment.

- ***multi-screen***: the development environment will be displayed on a screen and the different panes will be grouped on the second screen.

- ***wide screen***: the free space on the right of the screen is optimized to free the bottom of the editor.  




The environment can be changed or customized at any time.
