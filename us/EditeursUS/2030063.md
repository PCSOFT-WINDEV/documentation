## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000267"></a>
Modern computers (servers and desktop computers) are equipped with 64-bit operating systems. 

The main difference between a "32-bit" and a "64-bit" system is as follows: in "64-bit", the applications and the system no longer have memory allocation limitations. 

In "32-bit" configurations the operating system is limited to 4 GB, while in "64-bit", there is nearly no limit (18 billion GB). 

**Operating mode of 32-bit applications**:

- 32-bit WINDEV applications operate on a 64-bit operating system without modification: executable, setup, ... 

- 32-bit applications run on a 64-bit system are indicated in the task manager. These applications are neither disrupted nor run in a compatibility mode: they are subject to the memory constraints of 32-bit applications. This limitation is not a constraint for most of the standard applications. 




**Remark**: All projects created with WINDEV 28 and later will be in 64-bit mode by default.

## How to?
<a name="how_ELTTEXTE000291"></a>


### Prerequisite
<a name="prerequisite_ELTPARAGRAPHE000032"></a>

- Determine which user computers run 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems. 
	Caution: 64-bit applications cannot run on a 32-bit system. 

- Check for 32-bit application dependencies. Does the application use any of the following? Is it available in 64-bit?: 

	- an ActiveX control,

	- an external database: you must make sure that a 64-bit Native Connector is available.

	- the user computer must have a 64-bit client library to connect to the external database,

	- a Windows API or a dll,

	- a .NET assembly,

	- external applications (OLE Automation). If the application uses Word, Excel, LibreOffice, etc.: you must make sure that the 64-bit versions of these external applications are installed on the user computers.










### Changing a WINDEV application to 64-bit
<a name="changing_windev_application_64bit_ELTPARAGRAPHE000048"></a>

To switch a WINDEV application from 32-bit to 64-bit: 


1. Open the 32-bit WINDEV project in the editor. 

2. Create a new project configuration: on the "Project" tab, in the "Project configuration" group, expand "New configuration", select "Windows executable", and then select "64-bit". The project configuration creation wizard starts. 

3. In the wizard: 

	- Specify the name of the project configuration. Choose an explicit name because this name will be used to create the generation directory of the files affected by the project configuration. 

	- Select the elements (windows, queries, ...) of this new configuration. In a standard case, all the elements of the 32-bit application must be selected. 
			Remark: The project elements will be shared between the two configurations. 

	- Validate the wizard. 




4. The project configuration is automatically created. 
	For more details on how to create and manage project configurations, see [Project configurations](../Editeurs/9000030.md). 




If your development computer is in 64-bit mode, you have the ability to run the test of the 64-bit application via the 64-bit "GO" option.

**Remarks**: 

- Creating a 64-bit application only: You have the ability to define that an application is a "64-bit" application when creating the project. However, this solution is more complicated because a "64-bit" application does not operate on a "32-bit" system bur only on a "64-bit" system.

- If you have created a project for a 64-bit application only, you can also create a specific project configuration for the 32-bit mode.

### Compilation error management mode
<a name="compilation_error_management_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000092"></a>

- For the applications and services (Windows or Linux) in 32-bit mode, the 64-bit compilation errors are disabled. 

- For the applications and services (Windows or Linux) in 64-bit mode, the 64-bit compilation errors are always enabled. 

- For the components, libraries and Webservices, the 64-bit errors are always enabled. 



<a name="NOTE3_3"></a>


### Compilation errors specific to the 64-bit mode
<a name="compilation_errors_specific_the_64bit_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000101"></a>

If the "32-bit" application was using Windows APIs or external DLLs, the transformation to "64-bit" mode may generate compilation errors. These compilation errors are specific to the "64-bit" mode. 

The most common error consists in using an "integer" variable to store a memory address.
 
On 64-bit machines, pointers take up 8 bytes of memory, whereas on 32-bit machines, they take up 4 bytes.
 
In this case, if a "standard" integer is used, the application may access a truncated memory address, therefore an invalid address. 

To avoid this problem, simply use the WLanguage [System int](../Motscles/1514049.md) type: this type uses an 8-byte integer in 64-bit and a 4-byte integer in 32-bit! 

**Tips**: 

- Don't forget to check that the APIs used exist in "64-bit" mode. And make sure that the DLL does not have a different name in "64-bit" mode and that its operating mode is identical. 
	If differences are noticed, you have the ability to use [In64bitMode](../WDLang1/1000019491.md) to call the API corresponding to the current system. 

- In 64-bit, if a value that is too large is assigned to a 1, 2, 4 or 8-byte Integer variable, the value of the variable will not be the same as in 32-bit.

## Limitations and adaptations
<a name="limitations_and_adaptations_ELTTEXTE000333"></a>


### Different limitations
<a name="different_limitations_ELTPARAGRAPHE000132"></a>

- [Hasp](../WDLang1/3013038.md) is not available in 64-bit.

- **NetXXX functions**: Only the client part is available in 64-bit, and is compatible with a 32-bit server. The server part ([NetStartServer](../WDLang3/3056013.md) and [NetEndServer](../WDLang3/3056024.md)) is not available.

- **64-bit external languages**: only C and C++ are available.





### Adaptations
<a name="adaptations_ELTPARAGRAPHE000147"></a>

- Access to the registry: on a 64-bit system, 32-bit applications that access the registry are redirected to the following location: "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node" .
	Remark: [RegistryQueryValue](../WDLang1/3065012.md) has an automatic access mode (*registryModeAuto* constant) that reads the right registry key according on the type of configuration and system the application is running on.

- Windows API or dll: in some cases, it will be necessary to use the "system int" WLanguage type. This type uses an 8-byte integer in 64-bit and a 4-byte integer in 32-bit.

- Access to system files: on a 64-bit system, 32-bit applications use different system directories. For example, 64-bit executables can access the "\\Windows\\system32\\" folder. However, 32-bit executables will access the "\\Windows\\SysWOW64" folder.

- For external components used in the project, you will need to enable 64-bit compatibility in the code of the component. For components created with a recent version of WINDEV, this mode is enabled by default.

- For specific processes on a 32 or 64-bit configuration, simply use [In64bitMode](../WDLang1/1000019491.md).





### Database management
<a name="database_management_ELTPARAGRAPHE000164"></a>Access to the database (whether HFSQL Classic or HFSQL Client/Server) remains the same, even when the application switches 
from 32 to 64-bit.

Note: By default, the HFSQL server is installed in 64-bit mode.

Two key points regarding external databases:

- Native Connectors are available in 64-bit mode, except for Sybase and Progress native connectors.

- do not forget to install the 64-bit version of the database client library on end-user computers (refer to the database developer).

## Installing the application
<a name="installing_the_application_ELTTEXTE000369"></a>


### Combined 32 and 64-bit installation
<a name="combined_32_and_64bit_installation_ELTPARAGRAPHE000181"></a>

If the telemetry report reveals that some users are still running a 32-bit operating system, a combined 32 and 64-bit installation can be performed.

For more details, see [Combined installation](../Editeurs/2030065.md).


### 64-bit installation only
<a name="64bit_installation_only_ELTPARAGRAPHE000191"></a>

If all users of the application are running a 64-bit operating system, the application can be available in 64-bit version only.

In this case, the 32-bit configuration is no longer useful and can be deleted (right-click the configuration in the "Project explorer" pane and select "Delete").

The setup procedure can be performed as usual. For more details, see [Setup procedure of an application](../Editeurs/2028062.md).  


### Switching from a 32-bit to a 64-bit installation
<a name="switching_from_32bit_64bit_installation_ELTPARAGRAPHE000203"></a>

If the 32-bit version of the application is already installed on user computers, and needs to be upgraded to the 64-bit version, simply deploy the 64-bit installation in the same directory as the 32-bit version.

Live Update will automatically show an update prompt to end users.

The application will then automatically switch to 64-bit on the user computers.

Remark: When generating the 64-bit executable, it is important to use a version number higher than the current 32-bit version.


### Switching from a combined installation to a 64-bit installation
<a name="switching_from_combined_installation_64bit_installation_ELTPARAGRAPHE000214"></a>

Just like in the previous case, simply create a 64-bit only setup procedure and deploy it on the same network directory as the combined installation.

Reminder: Make sure the 64-bit executable has a higher version number than the 32-bit executable, and make the update mandatory by setting a minimum version requirement.

When users launch the application, a mandatory update notification will appear and the application will switch to the 64-bit version.
