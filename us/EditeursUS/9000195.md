## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000232"></a>
After each new version of Android is deployed, Google requires a higher target API level ("TargetSdkVersion") to publish applications on Google Play. With the release of Android 10, Google now requires API level 29 to allow deployments. This new API level applies from:

- 3 August 2020 for new applications,

- 2 November 2020 for application updates.




**These are the changes that apply to applications**:

1. **On Android 10**

	- When the application is in the background, it is no longer possible to open a window. For more details, see [Behavior of applications in the background](#NOTE1_1b). 

	- It is no longer possible to get a unique device identifier with [SysIMEI](../WDLang1/3073029.md) and [SysSerialNum](../WDLang1/3073033.md). "Device owner" applications are not affected by this restriction.

	- It is no longer possible to manipulate WiFi connection parameters through programming. The following functions trigger a fatal error when used in Android 10 or higher: [WiFiActivate](../WDLang3/1000019350.md) (syntax to modify activation only), [WiFiAddNetwork](../WDLang3/1000019351.md), [WiFiDeleteNetwork](../WDLang3/1000019357.md), [WiFiConnect](../WDLang3/1000019352.md) and [WiFiListNetwork](../WDLang3/1000019356.md).
			"Device owner" applications are not affected by this restriction.

	- It is no longer possible to get the clipboard contents if the application is in the background.. In this case, [Clipboard](../WDLang1/3063004.md) will return an empty string.




2. **On Android 10 with API level 29**: 

	- Applications can no longer access files located on the external storage, outside their specific directories ([SysDirExternalStorage](../WDLang1/1000021793.md) with sseApp\* constants).
			These files can no longer be accessed in read or write mode. Hard-coded file paths or paths built from [SysDirStorageCard](../WDLang1/3073034.md) or [SysDirExternalStorage](../WDLang1/1000021793.md) with ssePublicxxx constants should no longer be used. This restriction will be permanent from Android 11, API level 30. On Android 10 (API level 29), some of these locations remain accessible, so they can be used with this version of WINDEV Mobile (to do so, the *requestLegacyExternalStorage* attribute is automatically added). However, it is recommended to make the necessary adaptations to the applications that access these locations.

	- Android 10 has implemented a new permission for the functions that allow locating the device: ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION. 
			This permission is automatically added when one of the following functions is used in the application to allow its use in the background: 
			


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [BeaconDetectBackground](../WDLang3/1000023112.md) | Notifies the application when the device enters or leaves the transmission range of a set of Beacons. |
| [BeaconDetectPrecise](../WDLang3/1000023115.md) | Used to find the Beacons near the device. |
| [BTLEListDevice](../WDLang3/1000021882.md) | Returns the list of accessible Bluetooth Low Energy devices. |
| [BTListDevice](../WDLang3/1000017132.md) | Returns the list of accessible Bluetooth devices. |
| [geoTrackingEnable](../WDLang3/1000021583.md) | Enables the management of location tracking in a WINDEV Mobile application. |
| [GPSDetectPosition](../WDLang3/1000019209.md) | Asks to be notified when the device gets close to a given location. |
| [GPSFollowMovement](../WDLang3/1000019206.md) | Requests to be notified periodically of the device's current location. |
| [GPSGetPosition](../WDLang3/1000019205.md) | Retrieves information about the current device position. |
| [GPSInfo](../WDLang3/1000019208.md) | Returns the information about the location provider used by the application for geolocation functions. |
| [GPSInitParameter](../WDLang3/1000019204.md) | Initializes the parameters of geolocation WLanguage functions and finds a location provider. |
| [GPSLastPosition](../WDLang3/1000019239.md) | Retrieves the information about the last known device position. |
| [GPSStatus](../WDLang3/1000019207.md) | Retrieves the activation status of the geolocation provider or asks to be notified when the status changes. |
| [GPSStopDetection](../WDLang3/1000019240.md) | Stops the location detection triggered by [GPSDetectPosition](../WDLang3/1000019209.md). |
| [MapFollowMovement](../WDLang3/1000019953.md) | Displays the current location of the device in a Map control and updates the location as it moves. |
| [MobileNetworkConnectionInfo](../WDLang3/1000020176.md) | Returns information regarding the current connection to data on the mobile network. |
| [WiFiDetectAccessPoint](../WDLang3/1000019353.md) | Starts detecting the Wi-Fi access points currently accessible from the device. |




**Remark**: The following error may appear when publishing an application on the Play Store: "The private key was not properly encrypted or is not a type of key we support". It is necessary to recreate the signature file of the application (this file can be recreated in the application generation wizard). 
**Caution**: If there are identifiers based on the signature file (e.g. Google Map identifier), it is also necessary to regenerate these identifiers with the new key. 


### Reminder: the target API level ("TargetSdkVersion")
<a name="reminder_the_target_api_level_targetsdkversion_ELTPARAGRAPHE000084"></a>

When an Android application is compiled, the generated APK includes a target API level ("TargetSdkVersion") of the Android SDK. With this level of target API, Android determines the features that can be included in the application, and the security rules that must be applied to it.

The target API level ("TargetSdkVersion") assigned to an application can be seen in the APK generation wizard, in the "Configuration" step: 

1. Click "Advanced configuration", 

2. In the "Advanced configuration" window, select "Edit manifest",

3. Expand the "uses-sdk" node,

4. "android:targetSdkVersion" shows the target API level.


This API level can also be modified. This means that it is possible to specify target API level 29 in a WINDEV Mobile application generated without update 118 661. But in this case the application will not have a framework adapted to the specifics of this API level. This solution should therefore be avoided, since Android will apply security rules different from those for which the application has been tested.

## Behavior of applications in the background
<a name="behavior_applications_the_background_ELTTEXTE000379"></a>


### Overview
<a name="overview_ELTPARAGRAPHE000106"></a>

From Android 10, Google no longer allows an application running in the background to open a window (Activity) [https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/background-starts](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/background-starts). This is a very important change that affects all Android applications, including those generated with WINDEV Mobile. "Device owner" applications are the only exception. In this specific mode, apps can still open a window.

An application that ran properly in all Android versions prior to 10 will therefore have limitations if it is installed on Android 10:

- when the application is running in the background, it is not possible to open a window ([OpenMobileWindow](../WDLang1/1000021018.md), [Info](../WDLang1/3021011.md), [Error](../WDLang1/3021013.md), [Dialog](../WDLang1/3021015.md), etc.),

- a WLanguage function that opens a window can no longer be used ([SMSRunApp](../WDLang3/1000020864.md), etc.),

- the Android framework of the application will also be blocked and will not be able to open a window from the background. Opening a background window via the framework is necessary to manage the following functionalities:

	- receiving a push notification,

	- detecting entry or exit from a beacon region ([BeaconDetectBackground](../WDLang3/1000023112.md)),

	- receiving a new position when position tracking is enabled ([geoTrackingProcedure](../WDLang3/1000021585.md)),

	- running tasks in the background ([BackgroundTaskxxx](../WDLang3/1000023472.md) functions).

	- running the application when the Android device is started.







These limitations apply to all applications generated with WINDEV Mobile 25 "Update 2" and earlier versions.
<a name="NOTE2_1"></a>


### Changes from WINDEV Mobile 25 Update 3
<a name="changes_from_windev_mobile_25_update_3_ELTPARAGRAPHE000153"></a>

The Android framework of WINDEV Mobile applications has been modified to take into account this requirement from Google. All necessary adaptations are included from WINDEV Mobile 25 Update 3 onwards. 

From WINDEV Mobile 25 Update 3, push notifications, position tracking, beacon detection, ... are restored. Additionally, the WLanguage security mechanism has been improved to trigger a fatal error if a function that opens a window is called when the application is in the background (see list of relevant functions). 

In order to make sure that an application runs properly on Android 10, you need to:

- use at least WINDEV Mobile 25 Update 3 to generate it,

- check all processes that can be run from the application in the background: these processes must not open a window. To optimize your code, you can: 

	- use [InBackgroundMode](../WDLang1/1000023457.md) to determine if the current process is running in the background.

	- use [ExeInfo](../WDLang1/3035001.md) to know if the application is launched when the device boots up. In this case, if this function is called with the **exeLaunch** constant as parameter, it will return the **exeStartup** constant.

	- If an application needs to interact with the user while it is in the background, the recommended solution is to display a notification. When the notification is clicked on, the application will be brought back to the foreground and will be allowed to open a window from the procedure called with the **ActionClick** property (the **ActivateApplication** property of the [Notification](../WDLang3/1000019441.md) variable must be set to True).




- when fine-tuning the application on an Android device, use the Android log to identify the origin of a possible crash during background execution. Since a window cannot be opened from the background, the WLanguage security mechanism cannot transmit any information. Errors are logged in the [Android log](../Editeurs/9000108.md).
