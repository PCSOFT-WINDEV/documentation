### Generating a Java application with WINDEV
<a name="generating_java_application_with_windev_ELTPARAGRAPHE000011"></a>

WINDEV allows you to generate a Java application without even knowing the Java language. The method for developing the application is identical to the method for developing any other WINDEV application.

When the WINDEV project is compiled, the windows and the WLanguage functions are automatically converted into Java.

**Remark**: We advise you create a new WINDEV project to develop a Java application rather than transform a WINDEV application into Java.

## Creating a Java project

### Creating the project
<a name="creating_the_project_ELTPARAGRAPHE000024"></a>

A Java project is created like any other WINDEV project. 

To create a project: 

- Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_nouveau.gif)
 in the quick access buttons. 

- The creation window appears: click "Project".

- The project creation wizard starts.




In one of the first steps of the wizard, you can choose how your project will be generated. To do so, select "Java archive" and continue.

Once your project is created, you develop in WLanguage like for any other WINDEV application.

**Remark**: The number of WLanguage functions that can be used in a Java project is limited in this version. This number of functions will increase in forthcoming versions. For more details, see [Functions available in Java](../Editeurs/9000056.md).

### Modifying the type of generation for the project
<a name="modifying_the_type_generation_for_the_project_ELTPARAGRAPHE000048"></a>

By default, a WINDEV project for Java corresponds to a specific project configuration. The type of generation for the project can be modified at any time. Simply create a new project configuration.

To manage the project configurations, go to the "Project" tab, "Project configuration" group and click "Manage configurations". For more details, see [Project configurations](../Editeurs/9000030.md).

### Characteristics of a Java project
<a name="characteristics_java_project_ELTPARAGRAPHE000072"></a>

Once the project has been configured as a Java project, all the tools available in WINDEV are automatically configured for the Java project:

- The compilation of the project indicates whether your project contains functions or controls that cannot be used in Java.

- The creation of the archive makes it possible to generate a ".jar" file in the EXE directory of the project.

- The setup module of the application only handles the files required for deploying the Java application.




**Remark**: We advise you create a new WINDEV project to develop a Java application rather than transform a WINDEV application into Java.

### RAD available in Java
<a name="rad_available_java_ELTPARAGRAPHE000085"></a>

On a Java project that handles data files, you have the abomotu to use the Full il Application RAD or the Window RAD (Simple RAD).

To use a RAD pattern other than the Simple RAD, the generated code will have to be adapted to operate in a Java application.

For more details, see [Handling a database from a Java application](../Editeurs/9000008.md).
