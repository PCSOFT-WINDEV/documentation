## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000135"></a>
Users are familiar with summaries, as the summary is the first element they look at in printed documentation.

The summary gives the user an idea of how the help system is organized.

Users can navigate the summary to find a specific help page.

The summary uses two categories of elements: 

- *** books***, which group the help pages into chapters and sections. In most cases, users click the book to view the book pages.

- ***pages***, which represent the individual help pages. Users click the page to open the corresponding help page.




In a CHM help file, pages and books can be in any order.

**Remarks**: 

- You can edit the summary in the help editor. All the help pages are displayed in the editor. These help pages can be moved and reorganized. If the help page must not be displayed in the summary at runtime, this must be specified in the [characteristics of a help page](../Editeurs/2010024.md).

- Help generated as a PDF document: the summary is used to create bookmarks in the PDF file.
