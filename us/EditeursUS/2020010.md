## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000082"></a>
The environments of WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile now respond to the voice commands.

It can be a menu choice that you dictate. For example, "File Open".  

This feature requires:

- Windows Vista (or later).

- a speech recognition program (Dragon Naturally Speaking for example, tests performed with version 9 "Preferred" or "standard").




**Remark**: The voice commands can also be used in the WINDEV applications. For more details, see [Voice commands in an application](../WDLang1/3013016.md).

To use the voice commands in the editor: 

1. Enable the voice recognition program.

2. Dictate the captions of menu options or buttons that you want to use.




**Remark**: The recognized language depends on the system used. A software (WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile) in English must be installed on a system in English.
