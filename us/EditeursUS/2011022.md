When a WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile project uses data files, it must be associated with an analysis. An analysis allows you to describe the structures of data (data files, items, etc.) used in your project.

The data model editor allows you to easily create an analysis.

Two methods can be used to create an analysis:

- ** 1st method**: Create the analysis (or Logical Data Model (LDM)) directly.

- ** 2nd method**: Create the Conceptual Data Model (CDM), then automatically create the analysis from the CDM.




**Remark**: In a WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile application, the "LDM" and "Analysis" terms are interchangeably used to define the structure of the database associated with a project.
