<a name="configuring_the_server_for_the_cgi_protocol_ELTTEXTE000136"></a>
To configure the Web server: 

1. Edit the "httpd.conf" file in a text editor.
	This file is located in the "/Conf" subdirectory of the Apache server  setup directory.

2. Add the alias definition for the CGI protocol (WD280AWP.EXE) to the "httpd.conf" file with the following lines:
	
	```txt
	ScriptAlias /<Alias>/ "Engine directory"
	<Directory "Engine directory">
	Require all granted
	</Directory>
	```


	- **Example: Development computer**: the engine is in the "C:\\WEBDEV\\PROGRAMS\\ENGINE\\WINDOWS\\AWP" directory and the alias name is WD280AWP:
			
		```txt
		ScriptAlias /WD280AWP/ "C:/WEBDEV/PROGRAMS/ENGINE/WINDOWS/AWP/"
		<Directory "C:/WEBDEV/PROGRAMS/ENGINE/WINDOWS/AWP/">
		Require all granted
		</Directory>
		```


	- **Example: Deployment computer**: the engine is in the "C:\\WEBDEV\\ENGINE\\WINDOWS\\AWP" directory and the alias name is WD280AWP:
			
		```txt
		ScriptAlias /WD280AWP/ "C:/WEBDEV/ENGINE/WINDOWS/AWP/"
		<Directory "C:/WEBDEV/ENGINE/WINDOWS/AWP/">
		Require all granted
		</Directory>
		```





3. Restart the Apache server.




**Remarks**:

- the \\ characters are changed into /

- don't forget the final / in the path.

- the case sensitivity must be complied with.

<a name="configuring_the_server_for_webdev_sites_ELTTEXTE000160"></a>
To configure the Web server:

1. Edit the "httpd.conf" file in a text editor. This file is located in the "/Conf" subdirectory of the Apache server  setup directory.

2. Add into the "httpd.conf" file the definition of alias for the images of each WEBDEV site:
	
	```txt
	;alias for the images, js, static files, css...
	Alias /<Name of Image alias>/ "Directory of application images"
	<Directory "Directory of application images">
	Require all granted
	</Directory>
	```


3. Add (if necessary) the information used to manage the short URLs in the "httpd.conf" file:
	
	```txt
	;for the management of short URLs
	<ProjectName Files>
		Require all granted
		ForceType application/WEBDEV28-awp 
	</Files>
	```


4. Example for the WEBDEMO site.
	
	```txt
	;alias for the images, js, static files, css...
	Alias /WEBDEMO_WEB/ "C:/WEBDEMO/WEBDEMO_WEB/"
	<Directory "C:/WEBDEMO/WEBDEMO_WEB/">
	Order allow,deny
	Allow from all
	</Directory>
	;to manage short URLs
	<WEBDEMO files>
		Require all granted
		ForceType application/WEBDEV28-awp 
	</Files>
	```


5. Restart the Apache server.

### Caution
<a name="caution_ELTPARAGRAPHE000062"></a>

- With the Apache server, the alias name is "case sensitive". You must comply with the case defined for the alias in the HTML pages that refer to the directory of images. 

- An alias of images must be defined for each WEBDEV site.

<a name="configuring_the_server_for_the_sites_that_use_active_webdev_pages_ELTTEXTE000190"></a>
To configure the Web server: 

1. Edit the "httpd.conf" file in a text editor. This file is located in the "/Conf" subdirectory of the Apache server  setup directory.

2. Add the following line into the "AddType" section:
	
	```txt
	AddType application/WEBDEV28-awp .awp
	AddType application/WEBDEV28-awws .awws
	```


3. Add the following line to the "Action" section:

	- In Windows: 
			
		```txt
		Action application/WEBDEV28-awp /WD280AWP/WD280AWP.exe virtual
		Action application/WEBDEV28-awws /WD280AWP/WD280AWP.exe virtual
		```


	- In Linux: 
			
		```txt
		Action application/WEBDEV28-awp /WD280AWP/WD280AWP virtual
		Action application/WEBDEV28-awws /WD280AWP/WD280AWP virtual
		```
