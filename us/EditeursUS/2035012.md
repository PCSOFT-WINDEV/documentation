## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000085"></a>
An object diagram represents a set of objects and how they relate to each other at a certain moment in time.

An object diagram is used to show a context (before or after an interaction between objects, for example).

For example, the diagram below presents a section of the general structure of motorcycles:

## Elements of an object diagram
<a name="elements_object_diagram_ELTTEXTE000109"></a>
An object diagram includes the following elements:

- **object**: represents a class instance.
	Remark: If a class diagram is opened, you can create an object from a class in this diagram (Drag and drop it from the "UML analysis" pane).

- **composite object**: visually represents an object made of other objects. For example: a window that contains scrollbars, buttons, etc.

- **link**: represents the relationship between different objects.

- **UML package**: divides and organizes the diagram representation (in the same way that directories organize files). Each package can contain objects and composite objects.
