## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000075"></a>
For the standard dynamic WEBDEV sites (with context), the access to the site can be done: 

- via a "standard" URL:
	
	```txt
	http://www.mysite.com/WD260AWP/WD260AWP.EXE/CONNECT/ProjectName
	```


- via a short URL. A short URL is easier to remember and it makes transparent the version of WEBDEV application server used.
	
	```txt
	http://www.mysite.com/ProjectName
	```





**The two types of URL are automatically available when installing a standard dynamic WEBDEV site.**

**Caution**: The short URLs only operate with the following Web servers: 

- Apache 2.2 and later,

- IIS 7 and later. 




**Remark**: The mechanism of short URLs only operates for the standard dynamic sites. For the AWP sites, the name of the application server can be hidden in the URL of the pages of an AWP site via the [mechanism for URL Rewriting](../Editeurs/2030054.md).
