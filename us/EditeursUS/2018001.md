	From version <B>18</B>, the User Groupware evolves. This help page corresponds to the User Groupware kept for backward compatibility. To get the help regarding the new version of the User Groupware, see [User Groupware](../Editeurs/1000021152.md).

## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000164"></a>
A Windows application, an Internet or Intranet site require to define the role of different contributors. Several access levels can be defined according to the user. All users have different responsibilities and requirements. Their field of action must therefore be more or less limited.

Let's take a simple example: a sales management application that offers the following features:

- Viewing the price list

- Modifying the price list

- Entering orders

- Entering customers.




Access may vary according to the user. For example:

- administrative assistants can see the price list and create orders

- sales representatives can see the price list, place orders and create new customers.

- sales directors have access to all options.




To manage these access levels in your WINDEV applications or WEBDEV sites, simply include the User Groupware. In just a few clicks, a standard application can be transformed into an application that manages several access levels. This feature can be easily implemented in a WINDEV application or in a WEBDEV site.

When starting the application or the site, the manager will be able to create users (identified by their login and password) and to give them access to some features of the site or application.

**Remark**: The User Groupware is available for WINDEV applications and for dynamic WEBDEV sites running on Windows or Linux. The User Groupware is not available in static, semi-dynamic, PHP or Ajax sites.

### To implement the User Groupware in your application
<a name="implement_the_user_groupware_your_application_ELTPARAGRAPHE000043"></a>

A single option is sufficient: on the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, click "User Groupware". For more details on the different options available, see [The options of the User Groupware](../Editeurs/2018004.md).

### Operating mode of the User Groupware
<a name="operating_mode_the_user_groupware_ELTPARAGRAPHE000081"></a>

An application that uses the User Groupware has two levels:

- user level

- supervisor level




**The user level**
The user connects to the application via a login window/page and he can access the features that have been allowed for him.

**The supervisor level**
The supervisor logs in to the application via a login window/page and accesses an advanced menu to configure users and their rights, or to launch the application. The configuration window/page allows the supervisor to:

- start the application.

- configure the groupware.




Configuring the groupware consists in creating users and groups, associating users with groups as well as managing the rights granted to each user (or group) on each window/page found in the application. Rights can be defined for menu options, groups of controls and controls. The supervisor can gray out these elements, make them inactive or invisible. These configurations take precedence over any configuration defined in the program.

For more information on the groupware configuration defined by the supervisor, see [Configuring the User Groupware](../Editeurs/2018006.md).

**Remark**: The details regarding the users and their rights are stored in files in HyperFileSQL format. The files regarding the users can be common to several applications. The files containing the rights granted to the users on the different windows/pages found in the application are specific to the application and they cannot be shared.

### Remark
<a name="remark_ELTPARAGRAPHE000113"></a>

In WEBDEV, the User Groupware stores the IP addresses of the Web users who are using the Web site.
