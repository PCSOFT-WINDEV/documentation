## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000120"></a>
Via the Project Monitoring Center, WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile allow you to define the different actions required to create a project:

- Managing requirements,

- Managing tasks,

- Managing bugs,

- Managing business rules.




These different elements are used to schedule and to monitor the evolution and the creation of a project.

During the development, the contributor can specify the current task (from the Project Monitoring Center for example).

**In "strict" mode, the developers cannot modify a project element (window, code, query, ...) without having previously specified the task affected by these modifications.**

The strict mode allows the project manager and the developer to easily monitor their work. Furthermore, the progress status of the requirements is close to reality: the status progress of a project is always known.

### Operating mode of the strict mode

When the strict mode is enabled, if the developer opens a project element that is not associated with the current task, this element is opened in read-only and a specific panel is displayed to the developer: ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=mode_strict.gif)


By clicking the "Managing the tasks" button, the developer can choose to:

- associate the current task with the element, 

- enable one of the tasks associated with the element, 

- associate a new task with the element and enable it, 

- associate an existing task with the element and enable it, 

- perform no action. In this case, the element cannot be modified.
