## Overview

From version 110042, the dates and times are stored in the Source Code Manager in UTC format (Universal Time Coordinates) instead of local computer time.

Consequences: 

- The times read from version 110042 in a repository and written with an earlier version will be shifted by 1 or 2 hours.

- Performance may decrease if developers use an SCM repository with both version 110042 and an earlier version. We recommend that developers use the same version of the product.

- The opening of projects found in the SCM is faster.
