WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile allow you to regularly save the different elements of your project in an archive file (ZIP extension). This file contains all the project elements that were saved. For more details, see [Making a project backup](../Editeurs/2030014.md). 

The archived project can be restored at any time. Projects are restored from WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile.
