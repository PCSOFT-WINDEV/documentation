## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000096"></a>
A query (typed in SQL code) can operate on different databases: HFSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, ...

You can perform a join between a query on a database of one type and a query on a database of another type.

Therefore, the data can be found in different databases. You have the ability to extract and aggregate data from any source.

This feature is very useful for managing existing Information Systems.

## How to?

To better understand the operating mode of the multi-database queries, let's look at a simple example:

1. On an Oracle database, the following query (named MyQry1) is run by [HExecuteSQLQuery](../WDLang4/3044084.md). This query is used to select the record numbers of the customers.
	
	```sql
	Select Customer.CUUniqueKey+10 as CUUniqueKey10 FROM Customer
	```


2. On an HFSQL database, the following query (named MyQry2) is run by [HExecuteSQLQuery](../WDLang4/3044084.md). This query is used to select the record numbers of the customers and their order number.
	
	```sql
	SELECT CUUNIQUEKEY,Orders.OrderNumber AS ORDERNUM from ORDERS
	```


3. The multi-database query executed is as follows:
	
	```sql
	SELECT * FROM MyQry1,MyQry2
		WHERE MyQry2.CUUniqueKey=MyQry1.CUUniqueKey10
		AND (MyQry2.ORDERNUM = '37348' OR MyQry1.CUUniqueKey10=80)
	```

	This query is run itself by [HExecuteSQLQuery](../WDLang4/3044084.md).
