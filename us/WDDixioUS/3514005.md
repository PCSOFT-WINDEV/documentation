## Overview

WDDIXIO is automatically installed along with WDMSG or WDINT.

To install WDDIXIO only, you must install and run the "InstallWDDixio.EXE" file (located in the WDMSG or WDINT setup package). 

**Remark**: The dictionary that comes with WDDIXIO is installed by default. To use a custom dictionary (created and edited with WDTRAD): 

1. Go to the WDTRAD setup directory and copy the "Dictionary" subdirectory (containing the custom dictionary).

2. Paste this subdirectory into the WDDIXIO setup directory.
