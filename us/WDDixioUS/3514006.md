## Using WDDIXIO with a WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile project
<a name="using_wddixio_with_windev_webdev_windev_mobile_project_ELTTEXTE000261"></a>
To use WDDIXIO in a WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile project: 

1. Configure WDDIXIO in you IDE. 

2. Set the options of WDDIXIO. 

3. Translate the different elements. 

4. Retrieve the translations. 




To configure WDDIXIO in your IDE:

1. Open the general options: on the "Home" tab, in the "Environment" group, expand "Options" and select "General options of WINDEV/WEBDEV/WINDEV Mobile".

2. In the "Translation" tab, select "WDDIXIO".

3. Select the source and target languages.

4. Validate.




To configure WDDIXIO:

1. Start WDDIXIO:

	- Select "Programs .. WDDIXIO .. WDDIXIO" in the "Start" menu.

	- Double-click "WDDIXIO.EXE" (in the WDDIXIO installation directory).




2. WDDIXIO is automatically minimized to the Windows taskbar:![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WDDixioBarreTaches.gif)


3. Open WDDIXIO (click the icon in the taskbar).

4. Configure the WDDIXIO interface:

	- Select the source language (current language of the text) and the target language (language into which the text will be translated).

	- Select the dictionary to use. This dictionary contains the different resources that have been translated with WDTRAD.
			WDDIXIO includes a French/English dictionary containing over 6000 translations.







To translate the different elements from WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile: 

1. Select the text to translate (e.g. the caption in the description window of a control).

2. Click "Translate" ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Combo_des_saisie_btn_multilangue.GIF)
 (in the description window of a control, for example).

3. If the text to translate:

	- is identical to an already translated expression, the corresponding translation is automatically applied (appears in the translation field, for example).

	- is not identical to an already translated expression, WDDIXIO opens automatically and suggests different translations. Translations are sorted by relevance. The icon on the left of each translation indicates the degree of relevance. 
			In this case, to retrieve the desired translation: 

		- In WDDIXIO: select the translation if necessary, and click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WDDixio%20-%20HC%20N%B0001%201.gif)
.  

		- In WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile, paste the translation in the desired field.

### WDDIXIO options
<a name="wddixio_options_ELTPARAGRAPHE000128"></a>

The ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Trad_param.gif)
  button is used to configure the options of WDDIXIO. WDTRAD also features these options. Options not available in WDDIXIO are grayed out. 

These options are available in two tabs. Only WDDIXIO options are presented here: 

- The "Translation" tab allows you to define translation options: 

	- **Allow "full-text" search**: By default, the dictionary searches for strings that match the beginning of the desired string, then strings that contain the search words, etc. A more complex search can be performed if this option is checked. This search mode can be used to find sections of sentences used in a different context.  

	- Web dictionaries: 

		- Google: If this option is checked, it is necessary to specify the Google API key to use Google Translate. The translation from Google will be suggested for each search, or only if the resource has not been found in the dictionary ("Use only when no WDTRAD translation is found" option). 

		- DeepL: If this option is checked, it is necessary to specify the Google API key to use DeepL. The translation from DeepL will be suggested for each search, or only if the resource has not been found in the dictionary ("Use when no WDTRAD translation is found" option). 


 Remarks: 

- You can use the arrows to the right of the list of dictionaries to define which dictionary will be used first. If the translation is found in the first Web dictionary, it will not be searched in the following dictionaries. 

- Remember to read the licenses and terms of use of the translation software used, particularly the invoicing terms and conditions. 

- The option "Protect sequences such as %1, &lt;%1!s!&gt; or even [%variable%] in the strings to translate" allows you to prevent the selected Web dictionary from translating these elements.

- Custom terminologies: The "Manage terminologies" button allows you to manage the dictionary and the terminology. You can: 

	- Generate dictionary statistics: number of resources, author, etc.

	- Reindex the dictionary if necessary ("Reindex" button). This option is recommended when a large number of resources have been modified or added to the dictionary. 

	- Manage custom terminologies. 

	- Search in the dictionary. 

	- See elements recently added to the dictionary. 

- The "Keyboard and input" tab allows you to manage input options. 

	- **Automatically change the keyboard language**. If necessary the missing keyboards can be automatically installed. This option installs and enables the missing keyboards in Windows (from Windows Vista). 








### Language settings
<a name="language_settings_ELTPARAGRAPHE000172"></a>

Each language has a menu button (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WDDixio%20-%20HC%20N%B0001%202.gif)
), which allows you to define the language settings: 

- Keyboard used and its variant, if necessary (e.g., English keyboard, US variant). 

- Format of symbols used for automatic reconstruction.  





### Translating to multiple languages
<a name="translating_multiple_languages_ELTPARAGRAPHE000182"></a>

By default, WDDIXIO supports two languages: a source and a target language. You can add a third language, which gives you two target languages. Thus, you can translate English text into Spanish and French. This translation mode is particularly useful when using web dictionaries. 

To add a new language, click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WDDixio%20-%20HC%20N%B0001%204.gif)
. To delete a language, click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WDDixio%20-%20HC%20N%B0001%203.gif)
