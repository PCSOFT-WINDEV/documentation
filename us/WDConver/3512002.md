## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000144"></a>
Before you start using WDConver, you must have:

- The WINDEV analysis (".WDD" file) into which the data must be imported. This analysis must have been generated at least once.
	Reminder: This analysis must contain the structure of the HFSQL files into which the data will be imported.

- The database containing the data to import.

## Choosing a conversion
<a name="choosing_conversion_ELTTEXTE000174"></a>
When it is started, WDConver proposes to:

- **Create a new conversion description**. This conversion will be automatically run at the end of its description.

- **Choose an existing conversion description** (".WDV" file) already created with WDConver. The conversion is automatically performed.
	This allows you to perform a conversion without having to re-describe it.
	A conversion description can also be used to start a conversion from a WINDEV application. For more details, see [Starting WDConver in command line mode](../WDConver/3512003.md).

## Converting the data found in a file of an external database into an HFSQL data file
<a name="converting_the_data_found_file_external_database_into_hfsql_data_file_ELTTEXTE000198"></a>
To describe and convert the data found in a file of an external database into an HFSQL data file:

1. Start WDConver and validate the different screens until you reach to the "Choose the data source" plane.

2. Select the "External database" data source.

3. Select the HFSQL Classic analysis (".WDD" file) containing the structure of the external files to convert.

4. Specify (if necessary) the password of this analysis at runtime. This password was defined in the description of the analysis.

5. Select the access mode to the external database ("Type" option). The connection can be established via:

	- an OLE DB provider,

	- an ODBC driver,

	- a native access (AS/400, Oracle, SQL Server, ...).
			**Remark**: To define the advanced connection parameters, click the ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=btn_fleche.gif)
 button.




6. Specify the data source of connection. This data source can correspond to:

	- The name and full path of database. 
			For example, with Access: "C:\\MyDirectory\\AccessDatabase.MDB"

	- The server name or alias.
			For example, with Oracle: "Oracle_Server"

	- The directory containing the xBase file (".DBF").
			For example: "C:\\MyxBaseDirectory"




7. Type (if necessary) the username that will be used to connect to the database. 
	**Remark**: This name was defined when creating the database. Several users with different rights can exist for the same database.

8. Enter (if necessary) the password used to connect to the database. This password was defined when creating the database.

9. Select the files (tables) whose data must be imported. The description of these files must be found both in the source database and in the destination WINDEV analysis. 
	**Remark**: If no table is found, enter the name of the table whose data must be imported.

10. Specify the directory where the HFSQL Classic data files will be created.

11. Save (if necessary) the description of the conversion (".WDV" file) so that it can be re-used.

12. Start the data conversion (validation button of the wizard). The HFSQL Classic data files are automatically created in the specified directory.
	**Remark**: If these files already exist, the converted records will be added after the existing records.

## Converting the data found in a file in Hyper File 5.5 format into an HFSQL Classic data file
<a name="converting_the_data_found_file_hyper_file_55_format_into_hfsql_classic_data_file_ELTTEXTE000222"></a>
To describe and convert a file in Hyper File 5 format into an HFSQL Classic data file:

1. Start WDConver and validate the different screens until you reach to the "Choose the data source" plane.

2. Select the "Hyper File 5" data source.

3. Select the analysis in Hyper File 5 format associated with the data to convert (".WDD" file) and specify (if necessary) the password of this analysis at runtime. This password was defined in the description of the analysis.

4. Select the HFSQL Classic analysis (".WDD" file) containing the structure of the files containing the data to convert and specify (if necessary) the password of this analysis at runtime. This password was defined in the description of the analysis.

5. Select the files (".FIC" files) whose data must be imported. The description of these files must be found both in the source database and in the destination analysis. Specify their logical name and password if necessary.

6. Specify the directory where the HFSQL Classic data files will be created.

7. Save (if necessary) the description of the conversion (".WDV" file) so that it can be re-used.

8. Start the data conversion (validation button of the wizard). The HFSQL Classic files are automatically created in the specified directory.
	**Remark**: If these files already exist, the converted records will be added after the existing records.
