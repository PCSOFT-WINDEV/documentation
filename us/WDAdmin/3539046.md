### Configuring the connections

<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WDADMIN_Onglets%20-%20HC%20N%B0005%201.gif)
The following options can be used to configure the connections:

- ***Maximum number of connections for the server***: 
	Maximum number of simultaneous connections allowed for all the sites managed by the administrator (a connection = a Web user).

- ***Maximum number of connections for a site***: 
	Maximum number of simultaneous connections allowed for each site managed by the administrator. This number can be modified for each site in the "Sites" tab.

- ***Maximum number of connections of a user to a site***:
	Maximum number of simultaneous connections allowed for a given Web user to each site managed by the administrator.
	If this parameter is set to zero, the user who tries to connect simultaneously to the same site will be automatically disconnected then reconnected.
	If this parameter is greater than zero, an error message will be automatically displayed after x simultaneous connections.
	This number can be modified for each site ("Sites" tab).
	The "Only one connection per automatically recycled IP" option limits to one the number of connections of a user. The same connection will be reused. To allow multiple connections from the same IP address (users through a router or proxy), select "Limits the number of connections to" and specify the number of connections allowed for the same IP address.




To validate the settings of connections, click the "Apply" button. The new settings are automatically taken into account.

To cancel the modifications, click the "Restore" button.

The following options are used to configure sessions and requests:

- ***Disconnect idle users since***:
	Maximum connection time allowed without any action performed by the user. When this time is exceeded, the Web user is automatically disconnected and an error message is displayed.
	This number can be modified for each site in the "Sites" tab.

- ***Duration of AWP contexts***: 
	Validity period of AWP contexts. As soon as the specified duration is over and if no new request was performed, the context file is deleted. For more details on AWP contexts, see [AWP: Management of contexts](../WDChamp/3539060.md).

- ***Duration of Webservices contexts***: 
	Validity period of webservice contexts. As soon as the specified duration is over and if no new request was performed, the context file is deleted. For more details on the management of webservice contexts, see [Generating a webservice](../WDLang3/3086002.md).

- ***Maximum request duration***: 
	Maximum timeout allowed between the beginning of an action performed by the user (via a button or a link) and the display of a response. When this time is exceeded, an error page is displayed but the Web user is not disconnected.

- ***Maximum task duration***: 
	Used to limit the runtime duration of a WEBDEV scheduled task or delayed task. The task will be automatically stopped when this duration is exceeded.
	For more details, see [WEBDEV: Scheduled tasks and delayed tasks](../WDLang2/1000019455.md).  

- ***Allow pre-launched sessions.***: This option is used to manage the pre-launched sessions on the WEBDEV Application Server. This option is used to optimize the connection time to the WEBDEV sites and Webservices found on the server. If this option is checked, you must: 

	- modify the project to manage the pre-launched sessions properly. For more details, see [Pre-launched sessions](../WDLang2/1000019485.md). 

	- configure the site or the webservice in order to specify the number of necessary pre-launched sessions ("Sites" or "Webservices" tab, "Parameters" button).







To validate the settings of connections, click the "Apply" button. The new settings are automatically taken into account.

To cancel the modifications, click the "Restore" button.

The WEBDEV administrator can allow (or not) the remote debugging of dynamic WEBDEV sites.
If the remote debugging is allowed, the following parameters must be specified:

- Main port (27 271 by default).

- Range of ports for sessions (between 27 282 and 27 289 by default).


The "Default" button is used to restore the default values.

This option is only available in the WEBDEV Deployment Administrator and opens the Hosting Control Center.
