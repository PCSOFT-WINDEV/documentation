## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000202"></a>
The WEBDEV administrator (Development version) is used to customize the error messages of a WEBDEV site.

The custom messages of a site are saved and automatically installed when deploying the WEBDEV site.

Remark: The page of site errors can also be customized from the WEBDEV project. For more details, see [Managing the site errors](../WDChamp/9000134.md).

### Priority order for the customization
<a name="priority_order_for_the_customization_ELTPARAGRAPHE000061"></a>

The priority order for the customization is:

1. customizing all messages for all sites installed on the server.

2. customizing the messages for a specific site.




**Caution**: Customizing the error messages for all sites is not recommended when using a shared server. Indeed, this modification will be applied to all WEBDEV sites installed on the server.

## How to?
<a name="how_ELTTEXTE000268"></a>
To customize error messages: 

1. Select the site that must be customized (specific site or all sites).

2. To customize ***the page used for all errors***:
	By default, the errors are displayed in a specific page. To customize this page:

	- Choose the "Custom" option:

	- Select an HTML page accessible from your computer.
			This must be a static HTML page that may contain images, ... 
			Two static controls are required in this page: These controls must respectively have the following tags for value: [%MSG%] and [%SYS%]. These controls will be replaced with the identifier and caption of the error. 
			This HTML page should be located in the &lt;ProjectName&gt;_WEB project directory.

3. To customize ***the error message and/or the error page***:

	- Choose the error identifier: the default caption is displayed. 
			To get an explanation about these messages, see [Error messages that can be displayed in the browser](../WDAdmin/3539002.md).

	- Select "Custom caption" and enter the new caption associated with the option. 
			Remark: The special characters used in the messages:

	- the {RECONNECT} tag means that the Web user will be automatically connected once the error message is displayed.

	- the %x characters will be automatically replaced when the error message is displayed.

4. To ***apply the changes***:

	- Click "Apply" to immediately apply the changes to the current computer.

	- Click "Save" to save the changes in a ".REG" file. 
			If the selected site is a specific site, the configuration file is saved in the project directory.
			If the selected site is "All the sites", the configuration file is saved in the WEBDEV directory.




5. To ***install the modified files***:

	- If the customization applies to a specific site, the remote setup will automatically select the configuration file and will run it on the server. If the HTML file for customizing the error page is in the project images directory (&lt;Project_Name&gt;_Web), it will be automatically installed.

	- If the customization affects all the sites on the server, you must:

		- Optional step: copy (if necessary) the HTML files of the error pages and the associated images to the Web server. 
						These files must be located in a server directory for which an alias was defined.

		- copy and run the ERR_MSG_WEBDEV.REG file on the Web server.







**Caution**: This customization is an advanced modification that requires knowledge in the management of Web servers.
