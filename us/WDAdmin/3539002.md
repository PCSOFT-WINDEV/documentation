The error messages that can be displayed in the browser are as follows:

| Errors | Designation |
| --- | --- |
| Error opening access log. Check setup | This message is displayed when starting a WEBDEV site.<br><br>This message is displayed by the OmniHTTPd server. This message can have several causes:<br><br>- the OmniHTTPd server is installed in a directory that uses long names. <br>	**Solution**: Re-install the OmniHTTPd in a directory that does not use long names.<br><br>- several OmniHTTPd servers are opened. <br>	**Solution**: Close all the opened servers and restart a single instance of OmniHTTPd.<br><br>- the "Log file" directory does not exist. <br>	**Solution**: In the control panel of the server, disable all the "Log File" directories and restart the server.<br><br><br> |
| HTTP/1.0 404 Object not found or Resource not found | This message is displayed in the Internet browser when starting the site.<br><br>This message is caused by a bad configuration of the Internet server. It means that the server cannot find the CGI protocol manager.<br><br>**Solution**: Check the configuration of the Internet server used, especially:<br><br>- the virtual directory (or alias) pointing to the directory containing the CGI protocol manager, WD280AWP.EXE<br><br>- the registry key of the CGI protocol manager must be set to WD280AWP.EXE.<br><br><br>Reminder: The WEBDEV configuration details are saved in the registry, in the following entry: "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\PC SOFT\\WEBDEV\\28.0". |
| Internet Explorer cannot open the Internet site... | This message is displayed by the Internet browser when running a WEBDEV site if no Internet server is started when running the site.<br><br>**Solution**: Start an Internet server before starting the WEBDEV site. |
| Could not resolve local name, Error code: 11004 | This message is displayed when starting the OmniHTTPD server.<br><br>**Solution**:<br><br>1. Open the properties of OmniHTTPD server (right-click the server icon in the taskbar).<br><br>2. Display the "Server" tab.<br><br>3. Uncheck "Lookup Site Address (Dynamic)".<br><br>4. Validate and restart the server.<br><br><br> |
| RunTime Error .WDD missing or invalid JW06 name | If you are using a WEBDEV site in development mode:<br><br>- Open your project in WEBDEV.<br><br>- Save your project.<br><br><br>If you are using a site installed on the WEBDEV application server:<br><br>- Recompile your project: on the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, expand "Recompile and synchronize" and select "Recompile project".<br><br>- Regenerate the library.<br><br>- Re-create the setup of your site.<br><br>- Re-install the site on the server.<br><br><br>**Remark**:<br><br>- In all cases, check whether the setup directory of example corresponds to the directory used by the WEBDEV administrator ("Applications" tab).<br><br>- Otherwise:<br><br>	- delete the administrator site.<br><br>	- in the development version, open your project in WEBDEV and click the "GO" icon.<br><br>	- in the deployment version, re-install the site.<br><br><br><br><br><br> |
| 1, ERR_MISSING_PAGE | The request is incomplete.

| 4, ERR_BUTTON_EXPECTED | The request is invalid. The action to perform is missing.<br><br>This error message can be displayed in several cases:<br><br>- a link is specified in the HTML page with the [%URL()%] syntax without button name in the parameters.<br>	**Solution**: In the parameters of a link, specify the name of button in the WEBDEV page corresponding to the action to perform.<br><br>- a click was performed on a button that only exists in the HTML page. This button does not exist in the page. <br>	**Solution**: The buttons found in the HTML page must have an equivalent in the corresponding WEBDEV page.<br><br>- a form validation is performed without using a button (JavaScript code) or a validation is performed via the ENTER button. <br>	**Solution**: A button must be used to perform the validation of a form. <br>	**Tip**: To allow the Web user to validate a form via the ENTER key, define a button whose type is "Send the value of controls to the server" in the WEBDEV page and associate this button with the ENTER shortcut ("Details" tab of control).<br><br><br> |
| 5, ERR_NO_CURRENT_PAGE | The site did not operate properly because no page was returned (<u><u><u><u>EndProgramm</u></u></u></u> may have been called without returning a page).<br><br>This error message occurs when a WEBDEV site is closed without using the HTML page indicating the end of connection.<br>To avoid this message, a page indicating the end of connection must be displayed by <u><u><u><u>PageDisplay</u></u></u></u> or <u><u><u><u>EndProgram</u></u></u></u>. |
