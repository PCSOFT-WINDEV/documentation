## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000392"></a>
To handle a Gantt Chart control through programming, WINDEV proposes: 

- [GanttXXX functions](../WDLang1/1000020914.md). 

- the [GanttTask](../WDLang1/1000020881.md) variable that represents a task. 

- the [GanttLink](../WDLang1/1000021076.md) variable that represents a link between two tasks. 




This help page explains how to handle a Gantt Chart control through programming:

## Handling the Gantt Chart control through programming
<a name="handling_the_gantt_chart_control_through_programming_ELTTEXTE000416"></a>




### Adding a task
<a name="adding_task_ELTPARAGRAPHE000064"></a>

To add a task into a Gantt Chart column: 

1. Define and fill a [GanttTask](../WDLang1/1000020881.md) variable. 

2. Add the task with [GanttAddTask](../WDLang1/1000020904.md).  




Example: 


```wl
NewTask is GanttTask

// Configures the task
NewTask.ID = GetIdentifier()
NewTask.Row = 1
NewTask.Progress = 50
NewTask.StartDate = Today()
NewTask.DurationInDay = 1
NewTask.Title = "New task"

// Adds the task
GanttAddTask(COL_Gantt, NewTask)
```


**Tip**: If the tasks are stored in a data file, the items must be named like the members of the [GanttTask](../WDLang1/1000020881.md) variable. Then, you will have the ability to use [FileToMemory](../WDLang1/3013071.md) to fill the variable in a single line of code: 


```wl
//Updates the variable with the data of the items in the data file
FileToMemory(NewTask, TaskForGantt)
```

<a name="NOTE2_2"></a>




### Adding a link
<a name="adding_link_ELTPARAGRAPHE000095"></a>

To add a link between two tasks found in a Gantt Chart column, all you have to do is call [GanttAddLink](../WDLang1/1000021075.md). This function accepts two syntaxes: 

- syntax used to link 2 tasks identified by their identifier: 
	
	```wl
	t1 is GanttTask
	t1.ID = "T1"
	t2 is GanttTask
	t2.ID = "T2"
	GanttAddLink(COL_Gantt, t1, t2)
	```


- syntax that handles a variable of type [GanttLink](../WDLang1/1000021076.md).
	
	```wl
	// Create a link via a GanttLink variable
	Link is GanttLink
	Link.SourceID = "T1"
	Link.DestinationID = "T2"
	GanttAddLink(COL_Gantt, Link)
	```





Remark: The created link is an "End to Start" link by default. The type of created link can be configured in the [GanttLink](../WDLang1/1000021076.md) variable or in [GanttAddLink](../WDLang1/1000021075.md). The available links are: 

- "Start to Start" link: The target task can only start if the source task is started.

- "Start to End" link: The destination task cannot end as long as the source task is not started (rare case).

- "End to Start" link (default case): The target task cannot start as long as the source task is not ended. 

- "End to End" link: The destination task cannot end as long as the source task is not ended.



<a name="NOTE2_3"></a>




### Organizing the tasks
<a name="organizing_the_tasks_ELTPARAGRAPHE000132"></a>

By default, the Gantt Chart columns are configured to automatically reorganize the tasks according to their links: if the user moves a task in time, all the tasks that depend on this task will be automatically moved. 

To disable this parameter and to freely organize the tasks: 

1. Open the control description window. 

2. In the "Details" tab, uncheck "Reorganize other tasks when the user makes changes". 

3. Use [GanttOrganizeTask](../WDLang1/1000020890.md) to force a selective reorganization of tasks.  



<a name="NOTE2_4"></a>


### Filling a Gantt Chart column with the data found in an HFSQL data file
<a name="filling_gantt_chart_column_with_the_data_found_hfsql_data_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000152"></a>

The records are stored in an HFSQL data file. The initial fill of the Gantt Chart control can be done by browsing the data file via the FOR EACH syntax and by adding each task via [GanttAddTask](../WDLang1/1000020904.md).


```wl
// GanttTask variable
MyTask is GanttTask

// Browse the tasks stored in database
FOR EACH Task 
	// Fills the information of the variable
	MyTask.ID = Task.Identifier
	MyTask.Progress = Task.Progress
	MyTask.StartDate = Task.Date
	MyTask.DurationInDay = Task.TaskDuration
	MyTask.Title = Task.Title
	// Adds the task
	GanttAddTask(COL_Gantt, MyTask)
END
```

<a name="NOTE2_5"></a>


### Retrieving a list of tasks
<a name="retrieving_list_tasks_ELTPARAGRAPHE000164"></a>

[GanttListTask](../WDLang1/1000021073.md) is used to get: 

- the list of all the tasks found in the Gantt Chart column: 
	
	```wl
	// Lists all the tasks
	arrList is array of GanttTask
	
	// Retrieves the list of tasks
	arrList = GanttListTask(COL_Gantt)
	
	InfoBuild("The tasks have been retrieved: the array contains %1 tasks.", ...
		arrList.Occurrence)
	```


- the list of tasks included between two dates: 
	
	```wl
	// Lists the tasks from today's date
	arrList is array of GanttTask
	
	// Retrieves the list of tasks
	arrList = GanttListTask(COL_Gantt, DateSys())
	```


- the task that is currently selected or hovered: 
	
	```wl
	// Retrieves the selected task
	arrList is array of GanttTask
	
	// Retrieves the list of tasks
	arrList = GanttListTask(COL_Gantt, ganttSelectedTask)
	
	InfoBuild("The retrieved task: %1.", arrList[1].Title)
	```




<a name="NOTE2_6"></a>


### Displaying the Gantt chart from a specific date
<a name="displaying_the_gantt_chart_from_specific_date_ELTPARAGRAPHE000183"></a>

To display the Gantt chart from a specific date and time, use [GanttDateTimePosition](../WDLang1/1000021036.md). 


```wl
GanttDateTimePosition(COL_Gantt, DateSys())
```

<a name="NOTE2_7"></a>


### Deleting a task
<a name="deleting_task_ELTPARAGRAPHE000195"></a>

[GanttDeleteTask](../WDLang1/1000020923.md) is used to delete a task. 

For example: 


```wl
// "Delete" button
IF YesNo("Do you want to delete this task") THEN
	GanttDeleteTask(COL_Gantt1)
END
```

<a name="NOTE2_8"></a>


### Deleting a link
<a name="deleting_link_ELTPARAGRAPHE000208"></a>

[GanttDeleteLink](../WDLang1/1000021080.md) is used to delete a link.

For example: 


```wl
// Deletes the links from the T2 task
GanttDeleteLink(COL_Gantt, "T2")
```


[GanttDeleteAll](../WDLang1/1000020924.md) is used to delete all the tasks and all the links from a Gantt Chart column. 

<a name="NOTE3"></a>
<a name="NOTE3_1"></a>


## Using the context menu (AAF)
<a name="using_the_context_menu_aaf_ELTTEXTE000482"></a>
The Gantt Chart Column control is associated with a context menu (AAF). The popup menu allows you to: 

- Add, delete or modify a task. 

- Link the selected task to a prerequisite task. 

- Delete all the prerequisites from a task. 

- Print the content of the Gantt chart. This option is available only if a "Gantt Chart" report was created.




To save the operations performed, you must use the events of the column. 

In the corresponding event, simply retrieve the task or link currently used and perform the corresponding process. 

**Example**: To store a task added by the user via the context menu in a "Task" data file, simply enter the following code in the "Exit from task input" event: 


```wl
PROCEDURE EnterInInput(gtEdited is GanttTask)

// Store the data
Task.Title = gtEdited.Title
Task.StartDate = gtEdited.StartDate
Task.EndDate = gtEdited.EndDate
...
HAdd(Task)
```


The same type of code can be implemented for the different events of the Gantt Chart column. Indeed, for each event in the control that handles a task or link, a procedure has been automatically declared by the Column control. 

These procedures receive a [GanttTask](../WDLang1/1000020881.md) or [GanttLink](../WDLang1/1000021076.md) variable affected by the event as parameter. 

<a name="NOTE4"></a>
<a name="NOTE4_1"></a>


## Advanced use of events associated with a Gantt Chart column
<a name="advanced_use_events_associated_with_gantt_chart_column_ELTTEXTE000506"></a>


### Advanced use of events with procedures
<a name="advanced_use_events_with_procedures_ELTPARAGRAPHE000257"></a>

You can also allow the user to define more precisely the characteristics of his task during an addition or a modification. 

To do so, create a window with the information to specify. 

In the code, simply open the window in the "Enter the task in input" event. To lock the direct input via the context menu of the column, the event must return <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>. 

This principle can be applied to all the events called by the context menu of the column. 

Example: 


```wl
PROCEDURE EnterInInput(gtEdited is GanttTask)

// Opens the window for task input 
// with the selected task (in Creation or Modification mode)
Open(WIN_TaskInput, gtEdited)

// Returns False to lock the direct input in the column
RESULT False
```

## Managing the bank holidays, the holidays and the working hours
<a name="managing_the_bank_holidays_the_holidays_and_the_working_hours_ELTTEXTE000530"></a>


### Managing public holidays
<a name="managing_public_holidays_ELTPARAGRAPHE000280"></a>

Public holidays can be set programmatically. Several WLanguage functions (starting with BankHolidayXXX) are available.

To define the bank holidays displayed in the Organizer, Scheduler, Calendar and Gantt Chart Column controls, you must use [BankHolidayAdd](../WDLang1/1000017304.md). This function allows you to define the list of bank holidays that will be used. This function allows you to customize the public holidays according to the country and local regulations. This function must be used at the beginning of the application because it has a global effect on the application.

The bank holidays will be colored in green in the Gantt chart. 

Example:


```wl
// Delete all public holidays
BankHolidayDeleteAll()
// Initialize the 11 public holidays common to the French regions and territories
BankHolidayAdd("0101")		// 1st of January
BankHolidayAdd(bhEasterMonday)	// Easter Monday
BankHolidayAdd("0501")		// 1st of May
BankHolidayAdd("0508")		// 8th of May
BankHolidayAdd(bhAscensionDay)	// Ascension day
BankHolidayAdd(bhWhitMonday)	// Whit Monday
BankHolidayAdd("0714")		// 14th of July
BankHolidayAdd("0815")		// 15th of August (Assumption)
BankHolidayAdd("1101")		// All Saints' Day
BankHolidayAdd("1111")		// 11th of November
BankHolidayAdd("1225")		// Christmas

// Add 2 additional public holidays for the regions of Moselle and Alsace
BankHolidayAdd("1226" + CR + bhGoodFriday)
```



### Managing the holidays
<a name="managing_the_holidays_ELTPARAGRAPHE000296"></a>

To manage the holidays in a Gantt chart for a given row, all you have to do is use [GanttAddHoliday](../WDLang1/1000021116.md). In this case: 

- The new holiday period is considered as being a non-working period for the row.

- The duration of the tasks is adjusted according to the specified holiday period.




Example: 


```wl
// Holidays for row 4
GanttAddHoliday(COL_Gantt, 4, "20140204", "20140204")
```



### Managing the working hours
<a name="managing_the_working_hours_ELTPARAGRAPHE000311"></a>

By default, the working hours are defined when describing the Gantt Chart control in the window editor. These working hours can be modified for the entire control with [WorkingHourStart](../Proprietes/1000018958.md) and [WorkingHourEnd](../Proprietes/1000019056.md). 

[GanttWorkingHour](../WDLang1/1000021117.md) is used to customize the working hours for a given row. 

Example: 


```wl
// For row 2, the working hours go from 9:30 to 12:00 then from 13:00 to 18:30
GanttWorkingHour(COL_Gantt, 2, "0930", "1200", "1300", "1830")
// For row 3, the working hours go from 10:00 to 17:00
GanttWorkingHour(COL_Gantt, 3, "1000", "1700")
```


Remarks: 

- This function affects the drawing of the Gantt chart if the hours are displayed in the Gantt chart. 

- This function affects the calculation of the task duration if the tasks are specified in hours.
