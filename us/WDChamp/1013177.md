## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000327"></a>
A Table control based on a data file is a control whose columns are bound to the items of a data file or query (data source). Each Table control column can be:

- Bound to an item of the data source.

- Bound to an item of a data file related to the data source.

- Calculated: If the column is not bound to a data file item, then it is a **calculated column**. For calculated columns, the content of the column is recalculated each time a row is displayed.




Each row in the Table control corresponds to a record of the data source.

**A table based on a data file control is used to**:

- View the content of a data file (or query) with one record per row and select a record (view the entire file or a selection of records selected according to a filter).

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) View the content of bound records (for example, view the order lines associated with an order displayed in the Table control). 

- Delete a record by deleting a row from the Table control.

- Modify a record by modifying the content of a row found in the Table control.

- Add a record by entering a row in the Table control.

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![HFSQL Client/Server](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HFCS.png) Automatically refresh the data modified from another computer.  




The number of records that can be viewed is unlimited, but only the visible rows in the Table control are loaded in memory.






### Notes
<a name="notes_ELTPARAGRAPHE000054"></a>

- Table controls based on a data file are mainly used to view data. To enter data, use the Edit controls.

- The row selected in the Table control corresponds to the current record in the data file. If the position is set to a different row in the Table control, the position in the data file also changes to the corresponding record.

## Table controls with direct access to the data source and with in-memory data source

### Types of Table controls based on a data file
<a name="types_table_controls_based_data_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000100"></a>

There are two types of Table controls based on data files:

- Table controls with direct access to the data source. These are the "standard" Table controls based on a data file.

- Table controls with in-memory data source. Only a specific number of file records (specified in the editor) are loaded in memory. These Table controls are mainly used to perform sorts and searches on any column.
	




For more details on these two types of Table controls, see [Comparison between the features of Table controls](../WDChamp/1013290.md).

### Limitations in Java: Cascading input
<a name="limitations_java_cascading_input_ELTPARAGRAPHE000121"></a>

In Java, cascading input operations are not available for Table controls with direct access to the data source. Cascading input operations are only available for Table controls with in-memory data source.

## Automatic synchronization (HFSQL Client/Server data)
<a name="automatic_synchronization_hfsql_clientserver_data_ELTTEXTE000399"></a>
A Table control based on a data file can be automatically refreshed, as soon as the associated HFSQL Client/Server data file is modified. This feature can be defined: 

- in the editor: 

	1. Open the Table control description window. 

	2. In the "Content" tab, select the display synchronization mode: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Table_Fichier_Synchro%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)


		- Never: No synchronization is performed (default case). 

- Modification only: The synchronization is performed when modifying a record. 

- Addition/Deletion only: The synchronization is performed when adding or deleting a record

- Always: The synchronization is performed when records are written to or deleted from the data file.

3. Validate. 

- programmatically: using the [SynchroHFSQL](../Proprietes/1000023408.md) property in the Table control. 




The automatic synchronization is performed:

- between the different instances of the same application on a computer or different computers,

- between different applications on one or multiple computers,

- between the different windows of the same application, whether or not the HFSQL context is the same between the windows.




Caution: Enabling this feature increases the server load when displaying the Table control or when elements are moved within the control.

## Automatic view of bound records
<a name="automatic_view_bound_records_ELTTEXTE000423"></a>
In a Table control based on a data file, you can expand a row to see the records from other data files bound to the selected row. 

Example: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Visu_enreg_li%E9_auto%20-%20HC%20N%B0004.gif&type=thumb)



### Implementation via the window editor (automatic mode)
<a name="implementation_via_the_window_editor_automatic_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000172"></a>

To allow the user to expand rows in a Table control based on a data file to see the bound records: 

1. Open the Table control description window. 

2. In the "Content" tab, check "Show row details with [ + ]". <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Visu_enreg_li%E9_auto%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif&type=thumb)
The settings window appears automatically. 

3. In the settings window: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Visu_enreg_li%E9_auto%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif)


	- If necessary, check "Display bound data". 

- Select the "Automatic" display mode. In this mode, all related data files are shown to the user. 

- Validate. 

4. Validate the Table control description window. 




At runtime, a context menu allows the user to see the data from the data file that is bound to the current values in the Table control. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Visu_enreg_li%E9_auto%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.gif)<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Visu_enreg_li%E9_auto%20-%20HC%20N%B0004.gif&type=thumb)


Remark: the image of the "+" sign displayed at the beginning of the row can be customized: 

1. Open the Table control description window. 

2. In the "Style" tab: 

	- Select "[+]/[-] image IW for row details". 

	- Click the "Plus/Minus image of the details internal window" button. 

	- Select the image corresponding to the button and validate.








### Implementation via the window editor (custom mode)
<a name="implementation_via_the_window_editor_custom_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000220"></a>

To allow the user to expand rows in a Table control based on a data file to see the bound records: 

1. Open the Table control description window. 

2. In the "Content" tab, check "Show row details with [ + ]". The settings window appears automatically. 

3. In the settings window: 

	- If necessary, check "Display bound data". 

	- Select the "Manual" display mode. In this mode, only the data from one data file is shown to the user. You can customize the data to be displayed. 

	- Select the source item in the data file displayed by the Table control. 

	- Select the bound item in the linked data file. 

	- Select the items that will be displayed in the table of bound data. You can use the ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=IconeAjouterPropriete.gif) and ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=IconeSupprimerPropriete.gif) buttons to choose the information to be displayed. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Visu_enreg_li%E9_manuel%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif&type=thumb)


	- Validate. 

4. Validate the Table control description window. 




When running the Table control, a "+" sign allows the user to display the data bound to the data file currently displayed in the Table control based on a data file. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Visu_enreg_li%E9_manuel%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.gif)


Remark: the image of the "+" sign displayed at the beginning of the row can be customized: 

1. Open the Table control description window. 

2. In the "Style" tab: 

	- Select "[+]/[-] image IW for row details". 

	- Click the "Plus/Minus image of the details internal window" button. 

	- Select the image corresponding to the button and validate.








### Implementation through programming
<a name="implementation_through_programming_ELTPARAGRAPHE000272"></a>

To allow the user to expand rows in a Table control based on a data file to see the bound records: 

1. Create a Table control based on a data file or query. 

2. In the Table control initialization code, use the [RowDetailsBinding](../Proprietes/1000023414.md) property.
