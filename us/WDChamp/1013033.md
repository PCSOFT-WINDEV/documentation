## Element identifier
<a name="element_identifier_ELTTEXTE000091"></a>
WINDEV, WINDEV Mobile and WEBDEV give you the ability to associate an identifier with each element found in a TreeView control. This identifier can be a character string or an integer.

This identifier can be used to store a specific information (number of the record corresponding to the element selected in the TreeView control for example).

**Remark**: You also have the ability to associate an image with an element. For more details, see [Associate an image with the elements](../WDChamp/1013034.md).

## Associating an identifier with an element
<a name="associating_identifier_with_element_ELTTEXTE000115"></a>
To associate an identifier with an element found in a TreeView control, this identifier must be specified in the following programming functions:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [TreeAdd](../WDLang1/3018012.md) | Adds a "leaf" element (and all necessary nodes) into a TreeView control. |
| [TreeInsert](../WDLang1/3018023.md) | Inserts a leaf into a TreeView control at a specific position. |
| [TreeModify](../WDLang1/3018013.md) | Modifies an element (node or leaf) in a TreeView control. |





These functions are also available in prefix syntax: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [&lt;TreeView&gt;.Add](../WDLang1/1000023422.md) | Adds a "leaf" element (and all necessary nodes) into a TreeView control. |
| [&lt;TreeView&gt;.Insert](../WDLang1/1000023761.md) | Inserts a leaf into a TreeView control at a specific position. |
| [&lt;TreeView&gt;.Modify](../WDLang1/1000023763.md) | Modifies an element (node or leaf) in a TreeView control. |

## Reading the element identifier
<a name="reading_the_element_identifier_ELTTEXTE000179"></a>
To find out the element identifier, all you have to do is use the following function:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [TreeIdentifier](../WDLang1/3018004.md) | Returns the identifier associated with an element (node or leaf) in a TreeView control. |





This function is also available in prefix syntax: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [&lt;TreeView&gt;.Identifier](../WDLang1/1000023766.md) | Returns the identifier associated with an element (node or leaf) in a TreeView control. |
