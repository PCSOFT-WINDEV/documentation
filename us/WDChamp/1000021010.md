## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000154"></a>
The Sunburst chart is a Pie chart containing several levels of hierarchical data.

This type of chart presents two benefits:

- On one hand, it allows for an organized display of several data. 

- On the other hand, this type of chart is interactive: clicking a section lets you get details about the sub-level of this section.

In this chart:

**1.** **Chart title.**
The characteristics of the chart title can be defined in the "Details" tab of the control description ("Edit chart title").
You can define the chart title, its position and style.

**2.** **Size of the hole**
A Sunburst chart can have a hole in the middle. The size of the hole can be defined in the "General" tab of the control description. 

**3.** **Chart section**
At each level, the values displayed represent a section. 

The end user can click a section of the chart to see the details of this section: the clicked section becomes the center of the chart and all its sub-levels are represented around it. And so on, ... A click in the center of the chart moves one level up.

The display of details is automatic: it is managed by the control.

Remarks: 

- You can display the labels of the sections (category labels) perpendicularly: use [grParameter](../WDLang3/1000018337.md) with the *grSunburstCaptionPerpendicularSection* constant.
	

- To define the starting angle of the first section, use [grSunburstStartAngle](../WDLang3/1000021915.md).

- To pull out a section (or all the sections), use [grSunburstPullOut](../WDLang3/1000021916.md).




**4.** **Tooltip**
The value of the data hovered by the mouse is displayed in a tooltip.

**Other characteristics**: 

- A radial color gradient by level is automatically managed by default. You have the ability to define the color of a section with [grSunburstSectionColor](../WDLang3/1000021288.md). 

- To limit the number of levels displayed, use [grParameter](../WDLang3/1000018337.md) with the *grSunburstMaxLevel* constant.
