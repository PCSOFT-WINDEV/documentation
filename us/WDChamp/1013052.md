### Creating a Crosstab report
<a name="creating_crosstab_report_ELTPARAGRAPHE000078"></a>

The report editor allows you to create "Crosstab" reports. In this case, the report contains a double-entry table only.

**To create a Crosstab report**: 

- Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_nouveau.gif) in the quick access buttons. 

- The creation window appears: click "Report" then "Report".

- The report creation wizard starts.

- In the wizard, select the type of report to create: Crosstab.






### The main steps
<a name="the_main_steps_ELTPARAGRAPHE000092"></a>

The main steps for creating a Crosstab report are:

- The item corresponding to the captions of columns.
	Remark: If this item is a "Date" item, the wizard proposes to:

	- keep only the day or the year for these dates.

	- define the period to take into account (start date and end date).




- The item corresponding to the captions of the rows.
	Remark: If this item is a "Date" item, the wizard proposes to:

	- keep only the day or the year for these dates.

	- define the period to take into account (start date and end date).




- The information that will be displayed in the table cells. This information can correspond to:

	- the number of records corresponding to the intersection between rows and columns.
			For example: the number of products ordered per product and per year. The customer named "Smith" has placed 2 orders in 2000 and 3 orders in 2001.

	- the sum, the average, the maximum or the minimum of an item.
			For example: the number of products ordered per product and per year. In 2000, 279 sofas were ordered.

	- an item.
			For example: the score given by each judge to a skater in competition. In the European championships 2002, the Italian referee gave a score of 5.2 to skater "A".




- The calculation of totals for the table rows and columns (if necessary).

- The format of the page on which the report will be printed. The report is printed in A4 format by default.

- The skin template of the report if necessary.

- The name and title of the report. This name (".WDE". file corresponding to the report) will be used to identify the report in your applications or in your sites.

- selecting the source of the report. For more details, see [Report data source](../WDChamp/1011055.md).

- selecting the data to display in the report. This data will be displayed in the data row of the table.

## Inserting a table into a report
<a name="inserting_table_into_report_ELTTEXTE000372"></a>
A table can be inserted into any report that does not already contain a table (except for the Label reports).

**Remark**: Only a simple table can be inserted. A crosstab cannot be inserted into an existing report.

This report must contain at least two blocks: the *Body* block and a header block (*Page header*, *Break header* or *Start of document*).

**To insert a table into a report**: 

- On the "Creation" tab, in the "Structure" group, click "Table". 

- The table creation wizard starts.




Depending on the data source of the current report, you can:

- select the items that will be displayed in the table (report based on data file, query, ...). The selected controls are automatically included in the table.

- specify the headers of the table (report without data source, report based on text file).




In all cases, the header row of the table is created in the header block and the data row is inserted into the *Body* block of the report.
