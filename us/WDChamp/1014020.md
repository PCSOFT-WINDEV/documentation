## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000139"></a>
WEBDEV proposes two modes for moving controls in a page:

- **Controls that can be moved through programming**: several properties are available for positioning the controls.

- **Controls that can be moved with the mouse**: you have the ability to specify that a control can be moved by the user with the mouse. The new position of the control can be saved.

## Controls that can be moved through programming
<a name="controls_that_can_moved_through_programming_ELTTEXTE000163"></a>
The page controls can be moved dynamically by programming.

[X](../Proprietes/2510135.md) and [Y](../Proprietes/2510137.md) are available in read/write, in server code and in browser code.

You can:

- allow users to position controls or groups of controls.

- dynamically modify the location of controls according to some processes and actions.




Example: Following the mouse pointer: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Deplacement_Souris4.gif)

## Controls that can be moved with the mouse
<a name="controls_that_can_moved_with_the_mouse_ELTTEXTE000187"></a>
In a page, users can directly move controls using the mouse. Users will be able to reorganize the page as they like. You can also store the new position of the control defined by the user. Therefore, the next time the page is opened, the controls will be located at the desired position.

This feature is mainly used to easily move the controls found in a cell, in a looper or in a supercontrol, ...

**To allow the controls to be moved with the mouse**: 

1. Open the control description window.

2. In the "UI" tab, check the desired options in the "Overlay and move" area. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Champ_Deplacable_Page%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif&type=thumb)





If the control can be stacked, it can be moved with the mouse and its new position can be stored.

**Remark**: you can define a control that can be moved with the mouse in an internal page. This control can be moved in the page that hosts the internal page.

### Looper controls, Supercontrols and Cell controls
<a name="looper_controls_supercontrols_and_cell_controls_ELTPARAGRAPHE000062"></a>

To make Looper controls, Supercontrols and Cell controls movable with the mouse, you must also specify the controls that will allow the relevant control to be moved. 

For example, for Cell control: 

1. Open the control description window.

2. In the "UI" tab, in the "Overlay and move" area, select "Overlayable and movable with the mouse". <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Champ_Deplacable_Page%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif)


3. Click "Parameters" and select the controls that will allow moving the Cell control with the mouse: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Champ_Deplacable_Page%20-%20HC%20N%B0005.gif)





**Caution**: iFrame, WebCam, Flash or Java Applet controls cannot be used to move Looper controls, Supercontrols and Cell controls with the mouse.
