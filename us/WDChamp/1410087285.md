## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000105"></a>
Flexbox controls allow arranging controls exactly as desired when the browser is resized.

Here is a configuration example. 

A page contains 5 cells with images and text. These 5 cells are in a Flexbox control.

With the Flexbox control, when the browser is resized horizontally, the 5 cells are automatically positioned according to 3 rules:

- cells must be laid out on one or more rows depending on the available width,

- all cells must remain justified,

- cells must remain the same size.




Remark: This page is based on the "WW_Flexbox" example.





## How to?
<a name="how_ELTTEXTE000129"></a>
To rearrange the cells according to the size of the browser: 

1. Place the Cell controls in a Flexbox control: 3 cells on the first row and 2 cells on the second. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Flexbox_Exemple1%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif&type=thumb)


2. Open the Flexbox control description. The options to be modified are in the "Details" tab of the description window.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Flexbox_Exemple1%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif&type=thumb)
 Each rule to be applied corresponds to an option: 

	- when the width of the browser is reduced, cells move to the next row: 
			To apply this rule, go to "Line wrap (flex-wrap)" and choose "wrap". 

	- cells must occupy all the available width and be evenly spaced: To apply this rule, go to "Horizontal alignment (justify-content)" and choose "space-around". 

	- cells must remain the same size: To apply this rule, the "Vertical alignment on each line (align-items)" value is set to "flex-start".







To obtain a clean interface, the spacing between rows and columns is set to 20 pixels.

The anchoring options of the Flexbox control are set in a way so that it occupies all the available horizontal space and adapts vertically to fit its content.

Here is the result at runtime: 

- Maximized browser:
