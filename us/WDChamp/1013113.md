WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile handle the following events by default (order of appearance in the code editor):

| Event | Runtime condition |
| --- | --- |
| Initializing | Executed when the window is opened. (\*) |
| Click | Run when the user clicks the button. |
| ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Click on the arrow | Run when the user clicks the arrow of a split button. This code is run before the action associated with the arrow. For more details, see [Drop-down button](../WDChamp/1013163.md). |


(\*) By default, the "Initialization" event of each control is executed according to the order in which the controls were created in the window. To change this order of execution: 

1. On the "Window" tab, in the "Order" group, click "Initialization". 

2. In the window that appears, use the arrows on the right to change the order in which the controls are initialized.
