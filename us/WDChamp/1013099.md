## Overview of the Looper control
<a name="overview_the_looper_control_ELTTEXTE000372"></a>
A Looper control is used to repeat the controls found in a specific area. More precisely, a Looper control is a "container" control that is used to repeat several times all the controls (edit controls, static controls, combo boxes, ...) included in it.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ZR_Verticale.gif)
The Looper control allows displaying and entering data more easily.

Compared to the Table control, the Looper control presents richer interfaces as all types of controls can be repeated. 

The information displayed in the Looper control can:

- be defined programmatically: this is referred to as ***Looper control populated programmatically***.

- come from a data file or query: this is referred to as ***Looper control based on a data file***.

- come from a WLanguage variable: this is referred to as ***Looper control based on a variable***. 






 
![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) Only Looper controls populated programmatically are available.Remarks: 

- According to the platforms, the Looper controls can be displayed: 

	- vertically (by default on all the platforms). 

	- horizontally. 
			In WEBDEV, this type of control corresponds to the [Linear Looper controls](../WDChamp/9500203.md).

## Creating a Looper control
<a name="creating_looper_control_ELTTEXTE000396"></a>
To create a Looper control:

1. On the "Creation" tab, in the "Data" group: 

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) expand "Looper" and select "Looper (vertical)".
			![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png) Remark: You can create a horizontal looper via "Horizontal looper". 




2. Click where the control will be created in the window or page. The Looper control creation wizard starts automatically.




**Remarks**: 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) The dimensions of the control are optimized to take up the available space at the specified position. If the control size does not suit you, press Ctrl + Z: the control size will be reset to default. 




**To view the control characteristics**, select "Description" in the context menu of the control.

### Creating a horizontal Looper control
<a name="creating_horizontal_looper_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000172"></a>You also have the ability to create horizontal Looper controls. In this case, the control will include a horizontal scrollbar used to scroll the different rows. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ZR_Horizontale.gif)
To create a horizontal Looper control:

1. On the "Creation" tab, in the "Data" group, expand "Looper" and select "Horizontal Looper".

2. Click where the control will be created in the window or page. The Looper control creation wizard starts automatically.




To view the characteristics of the control, select "Description" in the context menu. 

For more details, see [Characteristics of a Looper control found in a window](../WDChamp/1013294.md).

## Attributes of a Looper control
<a name="attributes_looper_control_ELTTEXTE000426"></a>
<a name="NOTE2_2"></a>
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png)![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) 

### Attributes of a Looper control in WINDEV or WINDEV Mobile
<a name="attributes_looper_control_windev_windev_mobile_ELTPARAGRAPHE000221"></a>

A Looper control includes controls that are repeated on each row.

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png) The content of the tables, charts, ... can differ in each row. For more details, see [Displaying different content on each row](../WDChamp/1013289.md).

To get or set a characteristic of a control (value, color, etc.), simply handle this control programmatically.

**Remark**: For compatibility with WEBDEV, you can also use attributes. In this case, to get or set a characteristic of a control (value, color, etc.), simply handle this control or the corresponding attribute programmatically.

## Vocabulary
<a name="vocabulary_ELTTEXTE000456"></a>
To easily handle a Looper control, you must be familiar with the following vocabulary:

| Name | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Attribute | An attribute is the association between the control in the looper and the property of this control that will be modified on each row.<br>For each attribute, you must define:<br><br>- the attribute name.<br><br>- the name of the control in the looper.<br><br>- the property of the control that will be modified on each row (value, color, etc.).<br><br><br><br><br>![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) **Reminder**: The attributes are not mandatory. |
| Looper based on a data file | The Looper control is based on a data file or on a query. A record from the data file is displayed on each row. Two types of Looper controls based on a data file are available:<br><br>- ***Looper with in-memory data source***: The content of the looper is loaded in memory, then displayed. The access to the different control elements is faster. This mode is reserved for data files with less than 100,000 records.<br><br>- ***Looper with direct access to the data source (no limit)***: The Looper control displays the content of the data file or query directly. The current record corresponds to the selected element. Selecting an element in the control triggers an access to the linked data file. This mode is reserved for data files with more than 100 000 records.<br><br><br> |
| Looper populated programmatically | The Looper control is not based on a data file or on a query. The elements displayed in the control are defined by the developer (by programming). |
| Looper based on a variable | The Looper control is based on a variable (global to the project, window or page, class member, etc.). |

### Swapping a Table control and a Looper control
<a name="swapping_table_control_and_looper_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000284"></a>

WINDEV, WINDEV Mobile and WEBDEV allow you to automatically transform a Table control into a Looper control: 

1. Select the Table control to transform. 

2. On the "Modification" tab, in the "Transformations" group, expand "Refactoring and swapping" and select "Table to Looper".



<a name="NOTE5_2"></a>


### Refactoring: creating a Looper control from the selected controls
<a name="refactoring_creating_looper_control_from_the_selected_controls_ELTPARAGRAPHE000306"></a>

WINDEV, WINDEV Mobile and WEBDEV allow you to automatically create a Looper control from the controls currently selected:

1. Select the desired controls. 

2. On the "Modification" tab, in the "Transformations" group, expand "Refactoring and swapping" and select "Create a looper from the selection".
