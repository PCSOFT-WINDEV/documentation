### Control of a site
<a name="control_site_ELTPARAGRAPHE000011"></a>

The Site Map control allows the Web user to:

- have a global view of the pages found in the site.

- access a specific page directly.




The Site Map control is also used to improve the referencing of a site.

### Create a Site Map control
<a name="create_site_map_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000025"></a>

To create a Site Map control:

1. On the "Creation" tab, in the "Navigation" group, click "Site map".

2. Click where you want to create the control in the page. The control appears in the editor. If a navigation path is defined for the current site, the Site Map control displays the corresponding data.




To view the characteristics of the control, select "Description" in the context menu.

### Characteristics of a Site Map control
<a name="characteristics_site_map_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000049"></a>

The description window of a "Site Map" control allows you to:

- Build the site map of the site if necessary ("General" tab).
	If your site contains no "Site Map" control, you have the ability to edit and build [the site map path](../WDChamp/1013301.md).

- Specify the different sections of the site map to display ("General" tab).
	Indeed, several "Site Map" controls can be used in the same page: you have the ability to display them side by side and to use different presentation modes. If no element is selected, the entire site map will be displayed in the control (limited by the number of visible levels).

- Specify the number of columns for each level as well as the indentation of each level ("Details" tab).

- Indicates the styles used for each level of the site map ("Style" tab).
