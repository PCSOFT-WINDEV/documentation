## Events managed by default
<a name="events_managed_default_ELTTEXTE000131"></a>
WEBDEV manages the following events by default (order of appearance in the code editor):

| Event | Runtime condition |
| --- | --- |
| Declaration of global variables (Server code) | Declaration code of the variables global to the popup. All the types of variables are supported. They can be used in any event associated with the popup or with one of the controls included in the popup. |
| Initialization (Server code) | Executed when the page is opened. \* |
| Loading (Browser code) | Executed when the page is loaded. |
| Set the Value property (Server code) | Executed each time the [Value](../Proprietes/2510130.md) property is assigned to the popup (directly or with the [Value](../Proprietes/2510130.md) property) |
| Retrieve the Value property (Server code) | Executed each time the [Value](../Proprietes/2510130.md) property of the popup is retrieved. |


(\*) By default, the "Initializing" event of each control is run according to the order in which the controls were created in the page. To modify this order of execution: 

1. On the "Page" tab, in the "Edit" group, expand "Tab order" and select "Edit". 

2. In the window displayed, use the arrows on the right to modify the order in which the controls are initialized.

Several optional events can be managed.

To add an optional event:

1. Select the desired control.

2. Display the code window of this control (F2 key).

3. Click the link "Add other events to xxx" at the bottom of the window code, after the last event.  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Traitements_optionnels_WD_OK%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)


4. All the optional events available for the control are displayed. 

5. Check the optional event to add and validate. 
	Remark: You can select several optional events. 

6. The selected optional event is automatically added to the events managed by the control.




To disable an optional event, simply perform the same operations to display the list of optional events. Then simply uncheck the optional events to delete. 
Remark: If the disabled code contains WLanguage code, this code is automatically deleted.

You can manage, for example:

- the mouse hover over the control,

- left mouse button down, up, with a double click,

- right mouse button down, up, double click, 

- mouse wheel, etc.
