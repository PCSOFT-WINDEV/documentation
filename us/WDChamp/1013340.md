## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000072"></a>
WINDEV allows you handle a TreeMap control through programming. To do so, use the variable of the TreeMap control in the code. 

The variable of the TreeMap control corresponds to the name of the TreeMap control.

The TreeMap control can be handled through programming via: 

- the [TreeMap control functions](../WDLang1/1000019801.md). 

- the [properties associated with the TreeMap control](../WDChamp/1013337.md). 




**Remark**: You also have the ability to handle an element found in a TreeMap control through programming.



## Initializing a TreeMap control
<a name="initializing_treemap_control_ELTTEXTE000113"></a>
To initialize a TreeMap control, all you have to do is describe all the elements with [&lt;TreeMap&gt;.Add](../WDLang1/1000019740.md). 

**Remark**: A TreeMap control can be populated programmatically with: 

- records from a data file,

- elements from a Table control, ... 




**Example**:

```wl
// Fill a TreeMap control from a Table control based on a data file
Path is string
TMAP_Wine.DeleteAll()
FOR I = 1 _TO_ TABLE_WINE.Count
	Path  = TABLE_WINE.COL_WineType[I] + "\" + TABLE_WINE.COL_Owner[I]
	SWITCH TABLE_WINE.COL_WineType[I]
		CASE "RED"
			TMAP_Wine.Add(Path, TABLE_WINE.COL_Price[I], LightRed)
		CASE "WHITE"
			TMAP_Wine.Add(Path, TABLE_WINE.COL_Price[I], White)
		CASE "ROSÉ"
			TMAP_Wine.Add(Path, TABLE_WINE.COL_Price[I], PastelRed)
	END
END
```




## Handling a TreeMap control associated with a Table control

### Overview
<a name="overview_ELTPARAGRAPHE000180"></a>

When a TreeMap control visually displays the elements found in a Table control, it may be useful to allow interactions between the two controls. For example: 

- select in the TreeMap control the element selected in the Table control (and conversely). 

- select in the TreeMap control the group selected in the Table control. 




Let's see some examples of operations that can be performed.


### Displaying in the TreeMap control the element selected in the Table control
<a name="displaying_the_treemap_control_the_element_selected_the_table_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000195"></a>

To display in the TreeMap control the element selected in the Table control, all you have to do is use [&lt;TreeMap&gt;.Seek](../WDLang1/1000019742.md). 

**Example**: 

```wl
SelectionPath is string
SelectionPath = COL_WineType[TABLE_WINE] + "\" + COL_Owner[TABLE_WINE]
TMAP_Wine = TMAP_Wine.Seek(SelectionPath)
```



### Displaying in the Table control the element selected in the TreeMap control
<a name="displaying_the_table_control_the_element_selected_the_treemap_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000218"></a>

To display in the Table control the element selected in the TreeMap control, all you have to do is use [TableSearch](../WDLang1/3074015.md). 

**Example**: This code can be entered in the selection code of an element found in the TreeMap control: 

```wl
Path is string
Path = TMAP_Wine[TMAP_Wine]
Path = ExtractString(Path, 2, "\")
RowIndex is int = COL_Owner.Seek(Path)
TABLE_WINE.SelectPlus(RowIndex)
```



### Displaying in the TreeMap control the group selected in the Table control
<a name="displaying_the_treemap_control_the_group_selected_the_table_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000239"></a>

To display in the TreeMap control the group of elements selected in the Table control, all you have to do is use [&lt;TreeMap&gt;.SelectGroup](../WDLang1/1000019793.md). 

**Example**:  

```wl
SelectionGroup is string
SelectionGroup = COL_WineType[TABLE_WINE]
TMAP_Wine.SelectGroup(SelectionGroup)
```
