### Window control
<a name="window_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000011"></a>

The Camera control is used to: 

- ![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png) view the video captured by a camera connected to the current computer.




You can save this video or save a video snapshot.

**This help page presents the use of the Camera control in a WINDEV window. For WINDEV Mobile, see [Camera control (mobile application)](../WDChamp/1013349.md).**




### Creating a Camera control in a WINDEV window
<a name="creating_camera_control_windev_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000055"></a>

To create a Camera control:

1. On the "Creation" tab, in the "Graphic controls" group, expand "Video and capture" and select "Camera".

2. Click at the desired location to create the control. The control appears in the editor.




To view the characteristics of the control, select "Description" in the context menu.

The Camera control can be handled programmatically using the [Camera functions](../WDLang1/1410086597.md). 
Remark: These functions are also available with a prefix syntax. For more details, see [Camera functions (Prefix syntax)](../WDLang1/1000022386.md).

**Remarks**: 

- The Camera control operates with all the Windows versions, regardless of the driver installed, via the DirectShow technology. The behavior of the previous versions can be restored by selecting the "Use the former 'Video for Windows' APIs (compatibility)" option. 
	Remark: A Camera control that uses the DirectShow technology and a compatible Camera control should not be used in the same window.

- To retrieve an image transmitted by a Camera, specify the video driver used ("General" tab in the control description window). This driver can be defined programmatically with the [Driver](../Proprietes/2510061.md) property or the [CameraChangeDriver](../WDLang1/1000022451.md) function.

Only the video being captured can be viewed in a Camera control.

To view:

- an image captured with [CameraCapture](../WDLang1/1000022450.md), use an [Image control](../WDChamp/1013218.md).

- a video captured with [CameraCapture](../WDLang1/1000022450.md), use a [Multimedia control](../WDChamp/9500200.md).
