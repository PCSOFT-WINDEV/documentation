A bubble chart shows the correlation between three variables via bubbles of different sizes: categories and values on the X and Y axes and an additional parameter. The size of the bubble indicates the value of this third parameter.

In this chart:

**1. Bubble with its value**.
The value of the bubble is displayed if "Show values" is checked in the "Details" tab of the Chart control description.
To modify the color of a bubble, use [grCategoryColor](../WDLang3/1000020928.md). 

**2. Title of axes**. 
The title of horizontal and vertical axes is displayed if the title was defined in the "General" tab of the Chart control description. This parameter can also be defined through programming with [grAxisTitle](../WDLang3/3042057.md).

**3. Chart title**. 
The characteristics of the chart title can be defined in the "Details" tab of the control description ("Edit chart title").
You can define the chart title, its position and style.

**4. Legend**. 
The characteristics of the legend can be defined in the "Details" tab of the control description ("Edit chart legend").
You can define its position and its style.

**5. Labels of series**. 
The caption of the legend corresponds to the caption of the first series displayed in the chart (defined in the "Series" tab or through programming with [grSeriesLabel](../WDLang3/3042024.md)).

**6. Color of series**. 
The color of series corresponds to the color of first series. A color can be defined for each series in the "Series" tab of the control description. The color of series can also be defined through programming with [grSeriesColor](../WDLang3/3042013.md). An automatic color is used by default. 

**7. Category label and marks**.

The category labels can be defined in the "Series" tab of the control description.

The mark is automatically calculated by default. The "General" tab of the control description is used to:

- define a specific mark.

- define a scale on the X-axis according to the time. This option operates with Date or DateTime data coming from a Table control or from an HFSQL item. This option cannot be used with a series filled through programming.

- define a logarithmic scale on the Y axis.




You also have the ability to use the secondary scale for one or more series ("Series" tab).

**8. Gridlines**. 
To display the gridlines, select "Gridlines" and "Gridlines" in the "General" tab of the control description.

**9. Scrollbars used to perform a zoom**. 
The ability to zoom in a chart can be defined in the "Details" tab the of control description. This option is available in WINDEV only.

**Other characteristics**: 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) The "Bubble" charts can be displayed with an animation. To animate this type of chart, simply check "Enable animations" in the "Details" tab of the control description.
