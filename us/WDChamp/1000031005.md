### Overview

By default, the Dashboard control proposes to the user to: 

- Change to edit mode: the Edit mode allows users to configure their dashboard.

- Save the content of Dashboard control in image format.  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ChampTdB_FAAsimple.gif)





When users switch to "Edit" mode, they can configure the different elements in the dashboard:<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ChampTdB_FAAEdition.gif)
You can: 

- hide an element,

- add an invisible element,

- restore the initial configuration.  


The edit mode can also be used to modify the position and size of elements.

### Edit mode in the Dashboard control
<a name="edit_mode_the_dashboard_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000059"></a>

The following options are available in the context menu of the Edit mode: 

- Add: This option opens a submenu that displays the list of widgets made invisible and that can be added. 

- Hide: This option is used to hide the current widget. 

- Restore initial configuration: This option is used to restore the dashboard to its previous status (before the modifications performed in edit mode). All the modifications performed (size, position, hiding, addition) are canceled. 




The Edit mode can be configured through programming: 

- [DashMode](../WDLang1/1000020956.md) is used to: 

	- know whether the Edit mode is enabled,

	- enable or disable the Edit mode,

	- configure the available actions in Edit mode. You can for example allow the widgets to be moved and resized only.  




- Using [AAFDisable](../WDLang1/1000022018.md) with the *aafDashEditMode* constant disables the context menu used to switch to edit mode.
