## Default events
<a name="default_events_ELTTEXTE000114"></a>
WINDEV Mobile manages the following events by default (in order of appearance in the code editor):


| Event | Runtime condition |
| --- | --- |
| Initializing | Run when the window is opened. \* |
| Creating | Used to create the Native Container control. <br><br>This event must contain the call to the procedure for creating the control. You have the ability to pass parameters to the procedure called, especially the [Value](../Proprietes/2510130.md) property of control that is used to retrieve the handle (UIView in iOS, View Identifier in Android) expected by the SDK to handle the control. <br><br>![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Remark: [Handle](../WDLang1/3015005.md) can also be used to retrieve the control handle.<br><br>For more details, see [Handling a Native Container control through programming](../WDChamp/1410087045.md). |


(\*) By default, the "Initializing" event of each control is run according to the order in which the controls were created in the window. To modify this order of execution: 

1. On the "Window" tab, in the "Order" group, click "Initialization".

2. In the window displayed, use the arrows on the right to modify the order in which the controls are initialized.

4. All the optional events available for the control are displayed. 

5. Check the optional event to add and validate. 
	Remark: You can select several optional events. 

6. The selected optional event is automatically added to the events managed by the control.




To disable an optional event, simply perform the same operations to display the list of optional events. Then simply uncheck the optional events to delete. 
Remark: If the disabled code contains WLanguage code, this code is automatically deleted.
