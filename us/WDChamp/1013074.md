## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000189"></a>
When defining the action of a button in a page, a button can perform different operations depending on the type of the action selected.

<a name="NOTE2"></a>
<a name="NOTE2_1"></a>


## The different available choices
<a name="the_different_available_choices_ELTTEXTE000213"></a>
The operation performed during the action is chosen in the button description window ("General" tab).<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Btn_operation1.gif)
The possible operations during the action are:

- **Send values to the server (submit)**: 
	The button validates all the controls in the current page and returns the value of the controls to the server. Then, the server performs the specified action.

- **Do not send anything to the server**: 
	The button performs the requested action but it does not return the content of the controls found in the current page to the server.

- **Delete content of the controls in the browser (reset) - for compatibility**:
	The button clears all the page controls (except for the controls initialized through programming).

### Remark: Internet browsers only allow a single action on the page per process
<a name="remark_internet_browsers_only_allow_single_action_the_page_per_process_ELTPARAGRAPHE000035"></a>

Some types of buttons automatically trigger an action on the page ("Send the value of controls to the server (submit)").

This function will be ignored if [PageSubmit](../WDLang2/3058020.md) or [EmailOpenMail](../WDLang2/3032021.md) are used in the "Click" browser event of these buttons (or in a procedure called by this event): only the action of the button will be performed.

**Consequences**: [PageSubmit](../WDLang2/3058020.md) or [EmailOpenMail](../WDLang2/3032021.md) cannot be used in a code that triggers an action (automatically or not). These functions are ignored:

- in the click code of a button that performs the action "Send values to the server (submit)".

- in the click code of a button that performs an action different from "Do not send anything to the server".

- if [PageSubmit](../WDLang2/3058020.md) is followed by [EmailOpenMail](../WDLang2/3032021.md) (in the current event, in a procedure called by the current event or in another process called by [Execute](../WDLang1/3013041.md)).

- if [EmailOpenMail](../WDLang2/3032021.md) is followed by [PageSubmit](../WDLang2/3058020.md) (in the current event, in a procedure called by the current event or in another process called by [Execute](../WDLang1/3013041.md)).




To use [PageSubmit](../WDLang2/3058020.md) or [EmailOpenMail](../WDLang2/3032021.md) from a button ("Click" browser event of the button), this button must have the following characteristics ("General" tab in the description window):

- Operation on the controls: "Run browser click code only". 

- Action: "Do not send anything to the server".

<a name="choosing_type_button_ELTTEXTE000243"></a>
Let's see some "standard" examples for using buttons in a page:


| Action to perform | Example | Operation available with the action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Send data of the current page to the server to be processed | Registration form<br>The button checks whether the entered information is correct and displays a confirmation page. | Send value of controls to server (submit) |
