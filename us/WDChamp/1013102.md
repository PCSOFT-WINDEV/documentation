### Control of a report or window
<a name="control_report_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000011"></a>

The Shape control allows you to create geometric shapes in your windows and reports:

- Rectangle.

- Ellipse (this type of shape is not available in the reports).

- Diamond (this type of shape is not available in the reports).

- Arrow (this type of shape is not available in the reports).

- Line.




![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) The Shape control is available in the report editor only.

### Creating a Shape control in the window editor
<a name="creating_shape_control_the_window_editor_ELTPARAGRAPHE000049"></a>

To create a Shape control in the window editor: 

1. On the "Creation" tab, in the "Other controls" group, click "Shape".

2. Click at the desired location to create the control. The shape creation wizard starts. Choose the shape to create and its characteristics (line thickness, ...).

3. Validate the shape creation.




To view the characteristics of the control, select "Description" in the context menu.

Remarks: 

- To directly create a specific shape, on the "Creation" tab, in the "Other controls" group, expand "Shape" and select the desired shape.

- From version 12, the Arrow, Ellipse and Line shapes use the [GDI+ framework](../Editeurs/2020007.md): therefore, the "jagged" effects are reduced. If your window contains Shape controls that have been created with an earlier version, this new drawing mode is automatically applied.

- In the window editor, you can set a background image for the Rectangle, Ellipse and Diamond shapes ("Background image" option in the "Details" tab of the control description window). 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) In the window editor, [ShapePolygon](../WDLang1/1000022000.md) is used to create a free shape.

To move the extremities of an arrow, use the [ArrowXXX](../WDLang1/3029033.md) functions: 

- [ArrowStart](../WDLang1/3029059.md) is used to position the source extremity of the arrow.

- [ArrowEnd](../WDLang1/3029060.md) is used to position the end extremity of arrow.
