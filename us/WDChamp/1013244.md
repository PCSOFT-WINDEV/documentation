## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000185"></a>
WINDEV, WINDEV Mobile and WEBDEV allow you to handle several types of animated images:

- The **images animated by default**. These images have an animated image format (animated GIF for example). These animated images are automatically managed. No specific configuration is required.
	

- The **images animated by WINDEV/WINDEV Mobile/WEBDEV**. These images contain all animation drawings.






This help page explains how to handle the images animated by WINDEV, WINDEV Mobile and WEBDEV.

## Creating an image animated by WINDEV/WINDEV Mobile/WEBDEV
<a name="creating_image_animated_windevwindev_mobilewebdev_ELTTEXTE000209"></a>
To create an animated image: 

1. Create an image file.

2. In this image file, insert the different animation drawings. These drawings can be organized in rows or in columns, or in a combination of rows and columns.




Caution: All the drawings must have the same size and the spacing between the drawings must be identical.

### Using an animated image in a WINDEV or WINDEV Mobile application
<a name="using_animated_image_windev_windev_mobile_application_ELTPARAGRAPHE000081"></a>

To use a custom animated image in a WINDEV or WINDEV Mobile application:

1. Create an Image control.

2. Open the control description window ("Description" in the context menu of the Image control).

3. In the "General" tab, select the file containing the animated image.

4. In the "Details" tab, configure the animation options. Choose the type of animation and configure the associated options.




The options may differ according to the selected display mode.

The "one-way" and "alternate" options are used to configure the mode for reading the drawings of the image file. The images can be read from left to right and from top to bottom ("standard direction") or in the "reverse direction".

You can specify:

- The display time for each drawing of the animation ("Duration/Image").

- The number of drawings found in width and in height in the image file. Depending on the specified number, the image will be automatically divided into as many drawings as necessary.




The animation will be performed by displaying each drawing at regular time interval.

## Programming an animated image
<a name="programming_animated_image_ELTTEXTE000263"></a>
Several WLanguage functions are used to manage the animated images. These functions are as follows:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [AnimationGetParameter](../WDLang1/3017003.md) | Reads the value of one of the animation parameters defined for an Image or Static control. |
| [AnimationSetMode](../WDLang1/3017001.md) | Changes the type of animation: <br><br>- for an image in an Image control. <br><br>- for a text in a static control.<br><br><br> |
| [AnimationSetParameter](../WDLang1/3017002.md) | Changes one of the animation parameters used for: <br><br>- an animated image (in an Image control),<br><br>- an animated text (in a Static control).<br><br><br> |




<a name="NOTE4_2"></a>
Several WLanguage properties are used to manage the animated images. These properties are as follows:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [Animation](../Proprietes/2510006.md) | The **Animation** property animates an image. |
| [InitialAnimation](../Proprietes/2510012.md) | The **InitialAnimation** property determines whether the animation of an Image, Button, Static or Carousel control is enabled when the control is created. |
