## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000130"></a>
A report can be very wide, with a width exceeding the width of a paper sheet. This is the case of the Table, Scheduler or Gantt Chart reports, ...

The multipage print is used to print a report on several pages (2 or more) that can be placed side by side. 

This feature allows you to read large tables or schedules. 

In the editor, the report displays the different pages side by side: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Etat_Multipage_Editeur.gif&type=thumb)


At run time, all the pages are displayed in the report viewer and they can be printed: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Etat_Multipage_Go.gif&type=thumb)

If the report is too large for the specified format, the report creation wizard shows the following options: 

- Print the report on several pages. In this case, a multipage report is automatically created. 

- Use the landscape mode. 

- Reduce the report size. In this case, according to the reduction percentage, the printed report may become unreadable.
