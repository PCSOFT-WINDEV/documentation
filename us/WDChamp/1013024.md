A Combo Box control can be bound to an item in a data file, query, etc.

The following types of items can be bound to a Combo Box control:

- Text, 

- Numeric, 

- Date or Time, 

- Radio Button, List Box, Combo Box.




**The item bound to the Combo Box control will contain the index of the element selected in the control.**

**Remark**: When an item is bound to a Combo Box control, the content of the item is the same for all the records in the data file. For example, if the Combo Box item contains the options "Paid", "In progress", and "Pending", this content will be the same for all records. 

The contents of the Combo Box control can be: 

- entered directly in the data model editor,

- entered in the window or page editor,

- assigned in the code (with [ListAdd](../WDLang1/3049004.md)).
