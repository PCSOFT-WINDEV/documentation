	From version <B>18</B>, the framesets are available for backward compatibility with the former sites. However, they are not supported in HTML 5 and they are not recommended for the referencing and/or for the navigation from mobile devices. <br>We advise you to replace the framesets by pages that share page templates and/or control templates.
