## Overview of native Container control
<a name="overview_native_container_control_ELTTEXTE000091"></a>
The native Container control is used to manage the controls not created with WINDEV or WINDEV Mobile. This allows you to easily include in a window controls coming from an external module such as SDK. 

The Container control returns the handle (UIView in iOS, View Identifier in Android) expected by the SDK. Then, this handle can be directly used to handle the control.
