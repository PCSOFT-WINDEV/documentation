### Control of a report
<a name="control_report_ELTPARAGRAPHE000011"></a>

The "Internal report" controls are used to print several reports (secondary reports) in a single report (main report) without programming.

For example, the following main report is made of two secondary reports printed side-by-side:

- a report displaying the data in a table.

- a report displaying the data in a chart.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=EtatInterne.gif&type=thumb)

## Benefits of internal reports compared to the nested reports
<a name="benefits_internal_reports_compared_the_nested_reports_ELTTEXTE000288"></a>
The [**nested reports**](../WDChamp/1011001.md) can also be used to print several secondary reports in a main report. The secondary reports are printed one below another.
To print secondary reports, use [iPrintReport](../WDLang5/3046032.md) in the code of the block where the secondary reports must be printed.

The **internal reports** are used to print several reports **without programming**:

- one below another.

- side by side.

### Creating a main report made of several secondary reports
<a name="creating_main_report_made_several_secondary_reports_ELTPARAGRAPHE000061"></a>

To create a main report made of several secondary reports: 

1. Create and save all the secondary reports.

2. Create the main report: 

	- Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_nouveau.gif) in the quick access buttons. 

	- The creation window appears: click "Report" then "Report". The report creation wizard starts.

	- In the wizard, select "Blank report" and validate.




3. In the main report, create as many "Internal report" controls as the number of secondary reports to print. 
	To create an internal report, go to the "Creation" tab, "Structure" group and click "Internal report".
	**Remark**: The main report can contain all the other types of controls.

4. Associate each "Internal report" control with a secondary report ("Printed report" in the "General" tab of the control description). The secondary report will be entirely printed in the "Internal report" control.

5. Position the "Internal Report" controls in the main report.

6. Test the main report (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_GO_fenetre_WD_bl.GIF) in the quick access buttons) to check the print of your report.

### Main report not blank
<a name="main_report_not_blank_ELTPARAGRAPHE000099"></a>

If the main report and the secondary reports have the same data source, we recommend that you use an independent HFSQL context:

- for the main report.

- for the secondary reports.




**Remark**: To define an independent HFSQL context:

1. Open the report description (select "Report description" in the context menu).

2. In the "Data" tab, check "The report execution does not affect iterations (independent HFSQL context)".



<a name="NOTE3_3"></a>


### Secondary report
<a name="secondary_report_ELTPARAGRAPHE000120"></a>

A secondary report can contain all types of controls except for the "Internal report" controls.
<a name="NOTE3_4"></a>


### Secondary report based on a query with parameters
<a name="secondary_report_based_query_with_parameters_ELTPARAGRAPHE000127"></a>

If the secondary report is based on a query with parameters, use [iInitReportQuery](../WDLang5/3046021.md) to pass the parameters to the query. This function must be used in the "Before printing" event of the block containing the "Internal report" control.
<a name="NOTE3_5"></a>


### Secondary report based on a query that uses a specific connection
<a name="secondary_report_based_query_that_uses_specific_connection_ELTPARAGRAPHE000137"></a>

If the secondary report is based on a query that handles a specific connection, use [iInitReportQueryConnection](../WDLang5/3046028.md) to run this query (and to pass parameters if necessary). This function must be used in the "Before printing" event of the block containing the "Internal report" control.
<a name="NOTE3_6"></a>


### Secondary report based on an HFSQL view
<a name="secondary_report_based_hfsql_view_ELTPARAGRAPHE000147"></a>

If the secondary query is based on an HFSQL view:

1. Declare a global variable (character string) in the project and assign the name of the HFSQL view to this variable **before running the main report**.

2. Associate the view with the secondary report (with [ViewName](../Proprietes/2511030.md)) in the opening code of the secondary report:
	
	```txt
	NameSecondaryReport>.ViewName = <NameGlobalVariable
	```




<a name="NOTE3_7"></a>


### Passing parameters to an internal report
<a name="passing_parameters_internal_report_ELTPARAGRAPHE000164"></a>

The parameters given to the report (during the call to [iPrintReport](../WDLang5/3046032.md)) are automatically sent to the internal report. Caution: in this case, it may not be possible to pass parameters by reference. 

To pass parameters to an internal report, we recommend that you use global variables. For example, a global variable can be declared in the calling report. This variable can then be handled in the internal report via the following syntax:


```txt
<NameCallingReport>.<Variable name>
```


<a name="NOTE4"></a>
<a name="NOTE4_1"></a>

### Dimension of secondary reports
<a name="dimension_secondary_reports_ELTPARAGRAPHE000180"></a>

When printing the main report, the width of secondary reports is adjusted in relation to the width of the "Internal report" control.

All the blocks found in the secondary reports will be printed. The main report will automatically adapt to the height of the secondary reports by:

- increasing (if necessary) the height of the "Internal report" control.

- increasing (if necessary) the height of the block containing the "Internal report" control.

- moving to the bottom the controls located below the "Internal report" control.



<a name="NOTE4_2"></a>


### Reducing the width of a secondary report
<a name="reducing_the_width_secondary_report_ELTPARAGRAPHE000193"></a>

To reduce the width of a secondary report:

1. Go to the "Format" tab in the description of the secondary report ("Report description" in the popup menu).

2. Modify the width of the page where the secondary report will be printed.

3. Validate. 



<a name="NOTE4_3"></a>


### Page break in the secondary report
<a name="page_break_the_secondary_report_ELTPARAGRAPHE000204"></a>

The page breaks defined in a secondary report will be ignored when printing the main report.
<a name="NOTE4_4"></a>


### Opening the internal report
<a name="opening_the_internal_report_ELTPARAGRAPHE000213"></a>

The popup menu of the "Internal Report" control in the editor is used to directly open the internal report via "Open the internal report".
