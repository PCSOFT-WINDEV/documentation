## Creating a Chart control
<a name="creating_chart_control_ELTTEXTE000312"></a>
**To create a Chart control**:

- in a window or page: 

	1. On the "Creation" tab, in the "Graphic controls" group, click "Chart". 

	2. Click where the control will be created in the window or page. The Chart control creation wizard starts automatically.
			**Tip**: You also have the ability to create a Chart control directly by choosing its type: simply expand "Chart" on the "Creation" tab. The list of available types of charts is displayed. Click the type of chart you want to create. 




- in a report: 

	1. On the "Creation" tab, in the "Data" group, click "Chart". 

	2. Click where the control will be created in the report. The Chart control creation wizard starts automatically.





Remark: The dimensions of the control are optimized to take up the available space at the specified position. If the control size does not suit you, press Ctrl + Z: the control size will be reset to default.

To view the characteristics of the control, select "Description" in the context menu. For more details, see [Chart control: Characteristics in the editor](../WDChamp/3042076.md). 


### Automatic downsampling
<a name="automatic_downsampling_ELTPARAGRAPHE000119"></a>When a chart contains a large amount of data and becomes unreadable, a downsampling process is automatically used. 
![At the top: a chart without downsampling. At the bottom: the same chart with downsampling](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WD-Graphe-Echatillonage-Sub-Sampling.jpg)


Remark: the downsampling method is automatically used. It can be disabled by [grParameter](../WDLang3/1000018337.md).
