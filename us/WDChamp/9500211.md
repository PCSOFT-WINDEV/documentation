### Page control
<a name="page_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000011"></a>

The Multimedia control is used to easily display a video in the browser.
 Remark: In previous versions, this control was called Video control.

The control searches for the best video player found on the client computer according to the format of the video file to display. 

If the browser used supports the HTML 5 standard. the video will be automatically played without any specific video driver. 

The video can be controlled in browser code via [Multimedia functions](../WDLang1/1000015005.md).


### Creating a Multimedia control

### Video source (Video file)
<a name="video_source_video_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000057"></a>

The video file can be assigned to the control in server code only.

The video file can be:

- a path and a file name: in this case, the file will be sought in the _WEB directory (or in one of its sub-directories), the path given to the control must be relative to this directory.

- a URL (starting with http:// or https://) ending with the name of a video file (for example: http://videoserver.mycompany.com/films/presentation.wmv)

- a URL (starting with http:// or https://) not ending with the name of a video file (for example: http://videoserver.mycompany.com/film.awp?id=51452). In this case, [MultimediaReader](../Proprietes/1000019055.md) must be filled.

- a complete URL of a video hosted off-site (YouTube video for example). 
	Remark: In the case of a YouTube video, subtitle customization is not available.




The multimedia player used by the control depends on the file format and on the operating system.
If the browser used supports the HTML 5 standard. the video will be automatically played without any specific video driver. 
The table below summarizes the main cases:

| File extension | Multimedia player used by the video control |
| --- | --- |
| *Windows Media format*:<br><br>- .wmv<br><br>- .wvx<br><br>- .wma<br><br>- .wax<br><br>- .asf<br><br>- .asx<br><br>- .avi<br><br>- .wav<br><br><br> | In Windows, the Windows Media player is used.<br><br>On the other operating systems, the player to use is chosen by the browser. |
| *Flash video*:<br><br>- .flv<br><br><br> | The Flash software will be used if it is found. Otherwise, the video player to use is chosen by the browser. |
| *MPEG-4 Part 14 (ISO/IEC 14496-14:2003)*:<br><br>- .mp4<br><br><br> | The QuickTime software will be used if it is found. Otherwise, the video player to use is chosen by the browser. |
| *MPEG*:<br><br>- .mpg<br><br>- .mpeg<br><br>- .mp3<br><br><br> | In Windows with Internet Explorer, the Windows Media player is used.<br><br>On the other operating systems or with other browsers, the player to use is chosen by the browser. |
| *Apple QuickTime*:<br><br>- .mov<br><br>- .aiff<br><br><br> | The QuickTime software will be used if it is found. Otherwise, the video player to use is chosen by the browser. |
| *Ogg Vobis*:<br><br>- .ogg<br><br>- .ogm<br><br>- .oga<br><br>- .ogv<br><br><br> | In Firefox (version 3.5 and later), a "&lt;VIDEO&gt;" tag in HTML 5 standard is used.<br><br>With the other browsers, the video player to use is chosen by the browser. |

The video player used is returned by the [MultimediaReader](../Proprietes/1000019055.md) property.

**Remarks**: 

- The Multimedia control does not contain any playback codecs. The appropriate codecs must be installed on the computer of the Web user.

- If the choice of the multimedia player used was done by the browser, [the Multimedia functions](../WDLang1/1000015005.md) cannot be used.

- Depending on the multimedia player actually used, some features may not be available (for example, the Flash player of Adobe does not support the "Allow the full-screen mode" parameter).

- If the Web server used is IIS, a MIME type must be added onto the Web server for each type of video. 

- The browser used may not support all the formats. To check whether the browser supports the desired format (AVI for example), simply drop the desired file in the browser.

### Modifying the video dynamically through programming 
<a name="modifying_the_video_dynamically_through_programming_ELTPARAGRAPHE000216"></a>To dynamically change the video file associated with the control, simply assign the new file to the control. Example: 


```wl
// Modify the video displayed
// The new video is found in a "Video" subdirectory of the _WEB directory of the project
VIDEO_Video1 = "/" + FolderWeb() + "/Video/Wildlife.wmv"
```
