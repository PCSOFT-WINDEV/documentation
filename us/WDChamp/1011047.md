## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000150"></a>
The **Body complement** block is a block found in a report created with the report editor. The **Body complement** block is linked to the *Body* block. This block is used to fill the print until the page footer if the number of lines issued from the *Body* block is not sufficient.

This block is printed as soon as a free space if found between the *Body* block and the *Page footer* block.
