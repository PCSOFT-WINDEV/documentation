<a name="events_managed_default_ELTTEXTE000103"></a>
WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile manage the following events by default (order of appearance in the code editor):

| Event | Runtime condition |
| --- | --- |
| Initializing | Run when the window is opened. \* |
| Whenever modified | Run whenever the cursor of the slider moves, regardless whether the move is performed with the mouse or with the arrow keys. |


(\*) By default, the "Initializing" event of each control is run according to the order in which the controls were created in the window. To modify this order of execution: 

1. On the "Window" tab, in the "Order" group, click "Initialization". 

2. In the window displayed, use the arrows on the right to modify the order in which the controls are initialized.
