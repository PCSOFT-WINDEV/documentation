### Control of a report
<a name="control_report_ELTPARAGRAPHE000011"></a>

The Signature control is a report control used to sign: 

- the reports generated as PDF. 

- the report duplicates. 




This Signature control is used to implement 2 types of signatures: 

- **Approval signature**: An approval signature is a numeric signature applied to a document. A PDF document can contain several successive approval signatures, perform with the relevant software. When the document contains an approval signature, a bar with a green checkmark is displayed in Adobe Acrobat. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ChampSignature%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)


- **Certification signature**: In relation to the approval signature, the certification signature guarantees a higher level  for checking documents. When the document is certified, a blue bar with a certification icon is displayed in Adobe Acrobat. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ChampSignature%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif)

## Characteristics of the Signature control
<a name="characteristics_the_signature_control_ELTTEXTE000197"></a>
The Signature control can be configured in the editor via its description window.

The main control characteristics are available in the "General" tab: 

- **Type of signature**: Type of signature to generate: approval signature or certification signature. 
	Remark: The type of signature can be modified through programming with the [SignatureType](../Proprietes/1000021995.md) property. 

- **Caption**: Caption displayed in the Signature control. This caption can contain information about the person who signed the report for example. 
	Remark: The signature caption can be modified through programming with the [Caption](../Proprietes/2510053.md) property. 

- **Image**: Image displayed in the Signature control. 
	Remark: The image of the signature can be modified through programming with the [Image](../Proprietes/2510034.md) property. 

- **Default certificate**: Certificate used to sign the report. The different certificates installed on the current computer are proposed.
	Remark: The certificate used for the signature can be modified through programming with the [Certificate](../Proprietes/1000021684.md) property. 




Remarks: 

- The caption and the image are optional information.

- If the Signature control is invisible (option available in the "UI" tab of the description window), the generated PDF report (or the duplicate) will not be signed. 

- If the certificate associated with the Signature control is not found, the generated PDF report (or the duplicate) will not be signed.




- **Caution**: For Acrobat to recognize a signed PDF file, the organization that creates the signing certificate must be in the Adobe Approved Trust List ([Adobe Authorized Trust List](https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/kb/trust-services.html)) or in the Certified Document Services program (CDS). 
	If the certificate is not recognized, Acrobat will display the following message: "At least one signature has problems".
