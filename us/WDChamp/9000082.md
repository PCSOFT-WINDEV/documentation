## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000135"></a>
The "eYe magnet" (also called conditional formatting) consists in modifying the visual aspect of a control in order to attract the user's attention to this control. WINDEV allows you to automatically modify this visual aspect according to a set of conditions. 

For example, a control for which the input is mandatory will be displayed on a red background as long as its content remains empty.

The eYe magnet feature applies to the following controls:

- Edit controls.

- Combo Box controls.

- Columns of Table controls in input mode.

- Columns of TreeView Table controls in input mode.

- Cells of Pivot Table control.

<a name="defining_new_eye_magnet_ELTPARAGRAPHE000031"></a>

To define a new eYe magnet (conditional formatting):

1. Open the control description window (select "Description" in the context menu).

2. In the "UI" tab, click the link "eYe magnet: &lt;No layout&gt;" or the description of the current eYe magnet (if an eYe magnet was already defined). 
	Remark: For the cells of a Pivot Table control, in the "Content" tab, click the desired value ("Value to display in the table"). In the "Display" area of characteristics, click the link "eYe magnet: &lt;No layout&gt;" or the description of the current eYe magnet (if an eYe magnet was already defined). 

3. If the control has no formatting yet, the window for creating a conditional formatting is opened directly. 
	If one or more formatting already exist for this control, a window presenting the list of eYe magnets is displayed. 

4. Click the "Add an eYe magnet" button to open the description window of an eYe magnet.




The window for describing the conditions and actions is as follows: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=eyemagnet_fen_edition.gif)

- When all the conditions occur simultaneously, all the associated actions are automatically performed.

- Several eYe magnets can be defined on the same control to perform different actions according to the conditions.

- The eYe magnet is applied after the processes of the control (Entry in edit, Whenever modified, etc.). Its effects cannot be overloaded by programming.
