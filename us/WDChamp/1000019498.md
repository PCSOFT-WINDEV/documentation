<a name="control_found_window_page_report_ELTPARAGRAPHE000011"></a>

The Scheduler control is used to automatically display and handle schedules. It is used to manage the display of multiple resources and it is used in several applications or sites. 

The display is performed: 

- on a daily, weekly or montly basis,

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) on 6 months or on 1 year.


The time period, the first day of the week and the number of days to display can be configured. These parameters can be easily defined in the control description window. 

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) **Remark**: Scheduler controls are also available in Scheduler reports. For more details on how schedulers work in reports, see [Scheduler report](../WDChamp/1011078.md).

<a name="the_control_options_window_editor_and_page_editor_ELTPARAGRAPHE000080"></a>

The Scheduler control can be set up directly in the editor using the description window.

In the "General" tab it is possible to specify the window or the internal Page to be used to customize the display of appointments. For more details, see [Scheduler control: Customize appointments](../WDChamp/1000019658.md). 

In the "Detail" tab, the Scheduler control parameters are as follows: 

- **With buttons to change the time range**: This option is used to display buttons in order for the user to scroll the different periods of the schedule. These buttons are displayed at the top left of schedule. 
	

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) **Display**: By default, the display is performed on a monthly basis with a granularity for move and duration set to one day. When clicking the display options, a window is opened, allowing you to define the different display options: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Planning_Affichage_WD%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif&type=thumb)
It is possible to define the following elements: 

	- Total schedule range: day, week (5 or 7 days), according to the number of appointments, according to the number of days, 6 months, one year.

	- Granularity of appointments: Corresponds the display precision of schedule. The appointments can start on a multiple of XX minutes, hours, ... and they can have a duration multiple of XX minutes, hours, ... The arrow button is used to enter preset values. The lock is used to link (or not) the values. 

	- Range viewed: The range viewed is calculated from the control size in the editor. By entering the range to view, you get the minimum dimension of the element according to the selected unit. 




- When validating this window, the selected characteristics are summarized in the control description window.  

- **Resource display mode**: By default, resources are displayed by rows. 
	![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) They can also be displayed by columns. 

- **Time display**: Used to define:

	- the format of the date displayed for the "day" columns (or rows) of the scheduler.

	- whether the time must be displayed or not in the control. 

	- the format of the time displayed for the "day" columns (or rows) of scheduler.

	- whether the week number must be displayed or not, as well as its format. In the format, the '%1' string corresponds to the week number. Example of format: "Wk. %1". 




- **Time slots**: Used to define: 

	- **the visible time period**: Time period that will be displayed in the control. 

	- **the working time period**: Time period for which an appointment can be defined. 


![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) To define specific time slots, use [SchedulerWorkingHour](../WDLang1/1000022404.md) and [SchedulerWorkingHourResource](../WDLang1/1000022403.md).

- **Appointments**: Used to specify the characteristics of the appointments: 

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) **Overlap**: Management of overlapping appointments. The appointments can be displayed side by side or slightly shifted. 

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) **Continuous display if several days**: Used to display an appointment over several days as a single appointment. If this option is unchecked, the appointments on several days will correspond to as many appointments as the number of days.




- Other parameters: 

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) **Allow time range selection**: Allows the user to select a period with the mouse. 

	- **Allow direct input of an appointment**: Allows the user to add an appointment directly. 
			![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) To do so, click the Scheduler control to create the appointment and enter its caption via the keyboard. 
			

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) **Display and allow the appointments for the entire day**: Used to specify that an appointment can correspond to a whole day. In this case, a specific area is displayed in the Scheduler control. This area is used to enter the daily appointments.
			![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) You can specify the height of the area. 
			Examples: 

		- if the schedule is displayed with the resources in rows: 

			- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) In WINDEV: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Planning_journee_ligne.gif)







The edit options via the mouse are as follows:

### Context menu proposed automatically
<a name="context_menu_proposed_automatically_ELTPARAGRAPHE000326"></a>

The Scheduler control can display a specific context menu with automatic features available to the user. This menu is proposed by the AAF (Automatic Application Features). 

As soon as at least one resource is found in the schedule, this menu allows the user to: 

- Change the display mode of the schedule: daily, weekly, monthly display or display of the current day only. 

- Add, delete or modify an appointment when selecting a time period. 

- Copy the content of an appointment. 

- Print the contents of the Scheduler control.
