## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000446"></a>
WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile allow you to add optional events to the ones proposed by default for the different application elements. For more details, see [Optional events](../WDChamp/1014004.md). 

Depending on the optional event used, specific information can be retrieved via the _EVE.LPARAM and _EVE.WPARAM variables.

## Examples
<a name="examples_ELTTEXTE000518"></a>
The following example is used to find out the rotational direction of the mouse wheel: 

```wl
// -- Optional event: Mouse wheel 
Direction is int 
Direction = HiWord(_EVE.wParam) 
IF Direction < 0 THEN 
	Trace("The mouse wheel is going to the bottom") 
ELSE 
	Trace("The mouse wheel is going to the top") 
END
```

<a name="NOTE4_2"></a>
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png) The following example is used to add the window icon into the task bar when the window is minimized and to remove it when the window is maximized.


```wl
// -- Optional event: Resizing 
// Declare the constants 
CONSTANT 
	SIZE_RESTORED=0 
	SIZE_MINIMIZED=1 
	SIZE_MAXIMIZED=2
END 

// Add the "C:\Icons\Icon.ICO" icon into the taskbar 
// when the window is minimized 
IF _EVE.wParam = SIZE_MINIMIZED THEN 
	SysIconAdd("C:\Icons\Icon.ICO") 
END 

// Delete the "C:\Icons\Icon.ICO" icon 
// when the window is restored 

IF _EVE.wParam = SIZE_RESTORED THEN SysIconDelete()
```

<a name="NOTE4_3"></a>
The following example is used to delete the current row from a table when the Del key is pressed:

```wl
// -- Optional event: Key up 
// Include the "KeyConst.wl" file that contains 
// the standard Windows constants 
EXTERN "KeyConst.WL" 

// [Del] key up? 
IF _EVE.wParam = VK_DELETE THEN 
	// Delete the current row? 
		IF YesNo("Delete the current row?") = Yes THEN 
			TableDelete(MySelf) 
		END 
END
```
