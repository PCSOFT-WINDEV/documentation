<a name="events_managed_default_ELTTEXTE000212"></a>
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile manage the following events for control templates:

| Event | Runtime condition |
| --- | --- |
| Global declarations | Declaration of variables global to the control template.<br>This event is run before the "Global declarations" event of the host window (window in which the control template is integrated). |
| Initializing | Run when the window is opened.<br>The events are run in the following order:<br><br>- Initializing the controls of host window<br><br>- Initialization of the window<br><br>- Focus gain<br><br><br> |
| Entry | Run when the cursor enters in one of the controls of control template. |
| Exit | Run when changing control (going from a control found in the control template to another window control). |
| Whenever modified | Run whenever the content of control template is modified. |
| Set the Value property | Executed each time the ***Value*** property is specified for the control template (directly or with the Value property). This event is used to retrieve the parameters passed to the control template, for example. See [programming the control templates](../WDChamp/9000098.md). |
| Get the Value property | Run whenever the ***Value*** property of the control template is retrieved. This event allows the control template to return a value to the window that hosts the Control Template control. See [programming the control templates](../WDChamp/9000098.md). |


**Remark**: The control templates can have their own local procedures. These local procedures can be created:

- from the "Project explorer" pane (select the control template then "Local procedures", "New local procedure" in the context menu).

- from the code editor (go to the "Code" tab, "Procedures" group, expand "New" and select "New local procedure").

4. All the optional events available for the control are displayed. 

5. Check the optional event to add and validate. 
	Remark: You can select several optional events. 

6. The selected optional event is automatically added to the events managed by the control.




To disable an optional event, simply perform the same operations to display the list of optional events. Then simply uncheck the optional events to delete. 
Remark: If the disabled code contains WLanguage code, this code is automatically deleted.You can manage, for example:

- the mouse hover over the control,

- left mouse button down, up, with a double click,

- right mouse button down, up, double click, 

- mouse wheel, etc.
