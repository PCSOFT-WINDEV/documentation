## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000189"></a>
The images are often used to illustrate the site pages.

**Several types of images are available in WEBDEV for a dynamic page**. Each type corresponds to a specific use of image.

The type of the image is chosen in the "General" tab of the image description.

Four types of images are proposed:

- Static image.

- Dynamic image.

- Generated image.

- From a database.


To use the images generated and stored in a database in Linux, you must install the QT library (Core and GUI), version 5 or later.

|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Static image** |
|   | Use | Image not modified when using the site:<br><br>- company logo<br><br>- etc.<br><br><br>Image modified in browser code only: image selected by an upload control. |
|   | Characteristics | The image associated with a static image must be selected in the WEBDEV editor. This image can be modified through programming in browser code only.<br>All the image formats recognized by WEBDEV are allowed.<br>When saving the page, the image is automatically converted into GIF or JPEG format and saved in the &lt;Project Name&gt;_WEB directory (except if the image is already in GIF or JPEG format).<br>When deploying the WEBDEV site:<br><br>- The file associated with the image must be found on the server.<br><br>- If the image is modified in browser code, the new image must be accessible ([FolderWeb](../WDLang2/3012015.md) is used to find out the directory of images on the server) and it must be in a format recognized by the browser.<br><br><br> |
| **Dynamic image**: this is the most common type of image |
|   | Use | Image modified when using the site:<br><br>- image of the product in a product form<br><br>- photo of the contact in a directory<br><br><br><br><br>This type of image is used to manage the automatic scroll of images. For more details, see [Automatic scroll of images](../WDChamp/9500118.md). |
|   | Characteristics | A dynamic image can be modified through programming in server code or in browser code.<br>The image associated with the control through programming must be:<br><br>- Found in the &lt;ProjectName&gt;_WEB directory<br><br>- in a format recognized by the browser (GIF, JPEG or other)<br><br><br>Caution: no binary memo can be used.<br><br><br>To use the dynamic images, you must install the QT library (Core and GUI), version 5 or later. |
| **Generated image** |
|   | Use | Image drawn when using the site:<br><br>- Charts ([chart functions](../WDLang3/3042003.md))<br><br>- Drawings ([drawing functions](../WDLang1/3029033.md))<br><br><br>**Remark**: To specify a source image, the full path of this image must be specified. |
|   | Characteristics | A generated image is built while the WEBDEV site is used.  This type of image should not be used to display existing "image" files: the performance of your site might be reduced.<br>When the browser asks to display the image (when displaying or refreshing the page for example), a temporary image of current drawing is built on the server and saved in JPG format. <br>This image is displayed in the browser.<br><br>**Remark**: This type of image supports the transparent effect. This allows you to set a background image ("Style" tab of the Image control description window). |
| **From a database** |
|   | Use | <br><br>- Memo: Images of products displayed in a looper. The images are saved in the binary memos.<br><br>- Path: Images of products displayed in a looper. The path of the image is stored in a text item. This path must be relative to the "&lt;ProjectName&gt;_WEB"directory of the site.<br>	This type of image (from a database: Path) is used to manage the automatic scroll of images. For more details, see [Automatic scroll of images](../WDChamp/9500118.md).<br><br><br> |
|   | Characteristics | We recommend that you use a centered homothetic image: all the displayed images will be proportionally resized in order to be displayed in the Image control. |
