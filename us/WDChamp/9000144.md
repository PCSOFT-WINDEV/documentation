## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000209"></a>
A fixed area in a page is a page section that remains visible even if the Web user moves the browser scrollbar. This area (as well as the controls found inside it) remains visible while the page content scrolls. This area is fixed. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WB_ZoneFixe.gif)
WEBDEV offers a management of fixed areas for several types of elements: 

- [the layout areas](#NOTE2_1) (in Zoning mode). 

- [the Cell controls](#NOTE3_1). 

- [the popups](#NOTE4_1). 




**Use condition**: To use this feature, the page must be generated in HTML5. The generation mode can be defined: 

- in the "Advanced" tab of the project description, "Generation mode" option. To open the project description window, go to the "Project" tab, "Project" group and click "Description". In this case, the generation mode is applied to all the project pages. 

- in the "General" tab of page description, "Generation mode" option. To open the page description window, select "Description" in the context menu of the page. This option allows you to specify the generation mode that will be used for the page (it can differ from the generation mode selected for the other project pages).
