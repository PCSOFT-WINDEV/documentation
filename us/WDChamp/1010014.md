## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000110"></a>
WINDEV, WEBDEV et WINDEV Mobile allow you to handle a group of controls through programming. To do so, use the variable corresponding to the name of the group of controls in the code.

The variable of the group of controls corresponds to the name of the group of controls.

Example: 

```wl
// Handle the GR_Review group of controls
// Makes the group of controls invisible
GR_Review.State = Invisible
```


The operation performed on the groups of controls is global to the window being executed: it includes of the groups of controls found in the window, including the groups of controls found in an internal window, in an internal page, in a control template or in a supercontrol. In this case, the name of the group of controls must not be prefixed by the name of the element that contains it (internal window, internal page, control template or supercontrol for example).

Example: 

```wl
// Handle the GR_Review group of controls 
// in the IW_User internal window
// Makes the group of controls invisible
GR_Review.State = Invisible
```


Remark: In the code, you can identify the controls that make up a group of controls using [EnumControl](../WDLang1/3025005.md).

## Properties specific to groups of controls
<a name="properties_specific_groups_controls_ELTTEXTE000134"></a>
The following properties are used to manage the characteristics of a group of controls through programming.



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [ContextMenu](../Proprietes/2510077.md) | Used to find out and modify the context menu associated with a group of controls. |
| [Count](../Proprietes/2510097.md) | Used to find out the number of controls in a group of controls. |
| [Modified](../Proprietes/2510080.md) | Used to find out whether a control belonging to a group of controls was modified by the user (with the keyboard or with the mouse). |
| [State](../Proprietes/2510039.md) | Used to find out and modify the display status of a group of controls. |
