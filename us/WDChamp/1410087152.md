<a name="processes_managed_default_ELTTEXTE000141"></a>
WINDEV manages the following processes by default (in the order in which they appear in the code editor):

| Event | Runtime condition |
| --- | --- |
| Initializing | Run when the window is opened. \* |
| Modify selection | Run when selection is changed in the HTML Editor control. This event accepts parameters. This event has the following format: <br><pre><code>PROCEDURE ModifySelection(HTMLselection is edtHTMLSelection)</code></pre><br> where &lt;HTMLselection&gt; is an [edtHTMLSelection](../WDLang1/1000026093.md) variable that corresponds to the selected elements. |
| Load resources | Allows you to be notified and prevent application scripts or images from being loaded (for security purposes, for example). <br><br>This event accepts parameters. This event has the following format: <br><pre><code>PROCEDURE LoadResources(sURL is string, nType is int)</code></pre><br> where: <br><br>- &lt;sURL&gt; is a character string that corresponds to the URL of the resource to load.<br><br>- nType is a constant used to identify the type of resource to be downloaded: <br><br>	- *typehtmlImageRes*: the resource to download is an image. <br><br>	- *typehtmlScriptRes*: the resource to download is a script. <br><br>	- *typehtmlCssRes*: the resource to download is a CSS style.  <br><br>	- *typehtmlXMLHttpRequestRes*: the resource to download is an XML document generated as response to an HTTP request. <br><br>	- *typehtmlOther*: the resource to download is of an unknown type. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>If this event returns <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>, the resource will not be loaded. |
| Whenever modiying | Run whenever the HTML Editor control is modified. |


(\*) By default, the "Initializing" event of each control is run according to the order in which the controls were created in the window. To modify this order of execution: 

1. On the "Window" tab, in the "Order" group, click "Initialization".

2. In the window displayed, use the arrows on the right to modify the order in which the controls are initialized.

Several optional events are supported.
To add an optional event:

1. Select the desired control.

2. Display the code window of this control (F2 key).

3. Click the link "Add other events to xxx" at the bottom of the window code, after the last event.  ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Traitements_optionnels_WD_OK%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)


4. All the optional events available for the control are displayed. 

5. Check the optional event to add and validate. 
	Remark: You can select several optional events. 

6. The selected optional event is automatically added to the events managed by the control.




To disable an optional event, simply perform the same operations to display the list of optional events. Then simply uncheck the optional events to delete. 
Remark: If the disabled code contains WLanguage code, this code is automatically deleted.You can manage, for example:

- the mouse hover over the control,

- left mouse button down, up, with a double click,

- right mouse button down, up, double click, 

- mouse wheel, etc.
