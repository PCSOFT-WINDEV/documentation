## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000181"></a>
The animation of the Chart control allows you to propose a dynamic display in your applications. 

For example, during the first display of a Column chart, each bar seems to fly out from the X-axis. The animation is also performed when a value is modified. 

The animation of the Chart control is defined in the editor, in the ["Details"](../WDChamp/3042080.md) tab of the control description window.

### Animating a Chart control
<a name="animating_chart_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000042"></a>

To animate a Chart control: 

1. Open the Chart control description window.

2. In the "Details" tab: 

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) In "Animations of 2D charts", check "Enable animations". <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Graphe_Animation_WD%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)





3. Validate the control description window. 




Remarks: 

- This option is available for the following types of charts: 

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Area, Bubble, Line, Donut, Column, MinMax, Radar, Pie, Waterfall. 




- The animation performed on the Chart controls depends on the type of chart displayed. This animation cannot be configured. 

- By default, the animation of a Chart control lasts 30 milliseconds. 

- If a Chart control is animated, the animation will also be performed when the chart is drawn further to a change of value ([grDraw](../WDLang3/3042026.md)).  

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) The Chart controls created from version 19 are animated by default.

### Modifying or deleting the animation through programming
<a name="modifying_deleting_the_animation_through_programming_ELTPARAGRAPHE000120"></a>

The [AnimationDuration](../Proprietes/1000021069.md) property allows you to: 

- Find out and modify the duration of the animation in a Chart control. 
	
	```wl
	// Increase timeout
	CHART_MyChart.AnimationDuration = 2000
	```


- Cancel the animation of a Chart control. To do so, change the duration of the animation and give it a null value. 
	
	```wl
	// Temporarily stops the animation
	CHART_MyChart.AnimationDuration = 0
	```
