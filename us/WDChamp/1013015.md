## Creating a control in a report
<a name="creating_control_report_ELTTEXTE000454"></a>


### Creating a simple control
<a name="creating_simple_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000048"></a>

To create a control in a report:

1. On the "Creation" tab, click the control you want to create: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Etat_Ruban_Creation.gif&type=thumb)

### Creating a control from a dictionary control
<a name="creating_control_from_dictionary_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000063"></a>

A report control can be created from a control from a control found in a dictionary. A dictionary is used to store several elements (controls, reports, ...) for a future use in new projects. For more details, see [Dictionary](../Editeurs/2023002.md).

To create a control from a control found in a dictionary:

1. Display the ["Dictionary" pane](../Editeurs/2027014.md).

2. Open the dictionary if necessary ("Open" in the context menu).

3. Select the initial control found in the dictionary (in the "Report controls" category).

4. Drag and Drop the control from the dictionary to the future position of the control in the report.

5. Subscribe the created control to the dictionary if necessary. If the created control subscribes to the dictionary, the modifications made to the control found in the dictionary will be automatically applied to the created control. For more details, see [Subscribing an element to the dictionary](../Editeurs/2023001.md).

| Clipboard content | Type of created control |
| --- | --- |
| Unformatted text, retrieved in a text editor for example. | Static control |
| Formatted text, retrieved in a text editor for example. | RTF control |

To create a control from the clipboard content:

1. Copy the element to the clipboard (Ctrl + C from the element editor).

2. In the report editor, on the "Home" tab, in the "Editing" group, click "Paste" (or Ctrl + V).

You can bind: 

- a report control (Static, Calculated, Image, Bar code, Check box, Link or Chart) to a data file item found (or not) in the report data source.

- a report control (Static, Calculated, Image, Bar Code, Check box or Link) to a variable in the report data source.




To bind an existing control to data file item or variable:

### Copying a control from a report into another report
<a name="copying_control_from_report_into_another_report_ELTPARAGRAPHE000246"></a>

To copy a control from a report into another report: 

- ** 1st method**:

<a name="NOTE5_4"></a>


### Copying the control style
<a name="copying_the_control_style_ELTPARAGRAPHE000294"></a>

Copying the style of a control consists in copying the characteristics of a control style to another control. Only the control style is copied (not its content). 

For more details, see [Copying the control style](../Editeurs/2021001.md).
<a name="NOTE5_5"></a>


### Moving one or more report controls
<a name="moving_one_more_report_controls_ELTPARAGRAPHE000306"></a>

To move one or more report controls: 

1. Select the controls to move.

2. Keep the left mouse button down and move the controls with the mouse. The real-time interface checker allows you to align the controls (see the paragraph below).




Remarks:

- A control necessarily belongs to a block.

- The selected controls can also be moved with the arrow keys found on the keyboard. To speed up the move, press the Ctrl key together with the arrow key. To slow down the move, press the Shift key together with the arrow key.



<a name="NOTE5_6"></a>


### Locking controls
<a name="locking_controls_ELTPARAGRAPHE000321"></a>

In some cases, you may want to lock the controls in a fixed position: in this case, the control cannot position be modified and the control is not selected during a selection performed with the lasso. This feature is often useful for the layout controls.

To lock a control:

1. Select the control.

2. Use:

	- "Lock" in the context menu of control.

	- the Alt + V keys.

## Using an off-report control
<a name="using_offreport_control_ELTTEXTE000641"></a>


### Overview
<a name="overview_ELTPARAGRAPHE000363"></a>

In most cases, the controls belong to a report. Therefore, these controls appear in the report in edit mode and at runtime.

A control can also be positioned in the home window of a report: the control is said to be "off report". This control will be visible in edit mode only. This control will not be printed. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=EtatFenAccueil.gif)
An "off-report" control is used to store a report control without printing it. This allows you to use the content of the control programmatically (like a variable).
<a name="NOTE6_2"></a>


### Creating an "off-report" control 
<a name="creating_offreport_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000374"></a>

To create an "off-report" control: 

1. On the "Creation" tab, click the control you want to create.

2. Click the left section of the home window where the control must be created.
