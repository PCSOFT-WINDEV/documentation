## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000309"></a>
The "Image gallery" Looper control is used to manage the display of a set of images without programming. The images can have differents sizes and proportions: the Image Gallery control performs a harmonious display. 

The navigation between images is automatically managed. The control displays the images found in a directory, coming from a database or defined through programming.

## Gallery in rows
<a name="gallery_rows_ELTTEXTE000333"></a>


### Overview
<a name="overview_ELTPARAGRAPHE000034"></a>

An image gallery in rows proposes the same height for each image of the same row . The rows do not necessarily have the same height: this height is automatically defined according to the images found on the row.

The gallery in rows automatically adapts the width of each row to respect the image proportions.

Example: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Zone_r%E9p%E9t%E9e_galerie%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif)


A Gallery in Rows control is recommended to display images only (without text below for example).

- **Reference control**: A gallery in rows includes several rows. Each row contains at least one reference control. This reference control corresponds to an Image control, a clickable Image control or a Thumbnail control. This reference control is used to define a reference size (a minimum size). 
	This reference control is defined in the "Details" tab of the Looper control description window. 

- **Scroll popup**: It is possible to automatically open a scroll popup when clicking on the reference control: 

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) In the Looper control description window, in the "Details" tab, check "Display a popup on click". 




- At runtime, the height of each row automatically adjusts to fit the content displayed. 
	Caution: the display mode of Image control is very important. 

	- If the source image is smaller than the reference Image control, the display mode of the image is applied at runtime. 

	- If the height of source image is greater than its width in relation to the reference Image control, the row height will be increased.

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) **Defining the number of columns** ( "Details" tab of the control description): You have the ability to customize the display mode of columns in the gallery: 

	- Variable column width: If the width of the looper allows for an additional column, the number of columns does not change. Only the width of columns is modified. 

	- Variable width and number of columns: If the width of the looper control allows for an additional column, it will be added. Before adding the column, the rows are stretched horizontally. 

	- Variable number of columns (left):  If the width of the looper control allows for an additional column, it will be added. Images are aligned to the left. Before adding the column, an empty area may appear on the right. 

	- Variable number of columns (columns):  If the width of the looper control allows for an additional column, it will be added. Before adding the column, the columns are centered and an empty area may appear on either side of the centered columns.

	- Fixed width and number of columns (left): The number of columns and the width of the columns are not changed. Columns are aligned to the left. 

	- Fixed width and number of columns (centered): The number of columns and the width of the columns are not changed. The columns are centered.




- **Reference control**: A gallery in columns includes several rows. Each row contains at least one Image control. The "Gallery in columns" Looper control is associated with this Image control (or Clickable Image control or Thumbnail control). This control is used to define a reference size. 
	This reference control is defined in the "Details" tab of the Looper control description window. 

- **Scroll popup**: It is possible to automatically open a scroll popup when clicking on the reference control: 

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) In the Looper control description window, in the "Details" tab, check "Display a popup on click". 




- **At runtime**, the height of each row automatically adjusts to fit the content displayed. 
	Caution: the display mode and the anchoring options of Image control are very important. 

	- If the source image is smaller than the reference Image control, the dimensions of reference control are applied to the image at runtime. 

	- If the width of source image is greater than its height in relation to the reference Image control, the column width will be increased.
