<a name="overview_the_spin_control_ELTTEXTE000111"></a>
A Spin control is used to increase or reduce a value found in a control. The Spin control can be associated with an edit control for example.

A Spin control can be vertical of horizontal.

A Spin control includes a lower bound and an upper bound that represent the limits of the values taken by the Spin control. The value of the Spin control is given by the value of the control.

**To create a Spin control**:

1. On the "Creation" tab, in the "Graphic controls" group, click "Spin".

2. Click at the desired location to create the control. The control appears in the editor.




To view the characteristics of the control, select "Description" in the context menu. You have the ability choose the orientation of spin.
