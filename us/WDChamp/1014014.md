## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000870"></a>
WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile propose two types of masks:

- the ***input masks*** that define the characters that can be typed in the controls found in a window or in a page. Sometimes, these masks can also be used to modify the case (uppercase/lowercase characters) of the values assigned to the window controls or to the page controls by programming.

- the ***display masks*** that define the characters that can be printed in the controls found in a report.

## Default display masks
<a name="default_display_masks_ELTTEXTE000894"></a>
In a window, a page or a report, no input mask (or display mask) is associated by default with a text control. You can:

- select a preset input mask.

- create a custom input mask.


Remark: If the control is linked to an item, the value saved in the file will be the displayed value.

## Preset masks
<a name="preset_masks_ELTTEXTE000918"></a>
The following masks are proposed by WINDEV, WINDEV Mobile or WEBDEV (in the order in which they appear in the window editor or in the page editor):

- [Text masks](#NOTE3_2).

- ["Text and digit" masks](#NOTE3_3).

- ["Computer" masks](#NOTE3_4).

- ["Phone number" masks](#NOTE3_5).

- ["Company/Bank" masks](#NOTE3_6).

- ["Social security number" masks](#NOTE3_7).

- ["Zip code" masks](#NOTE3_8).

| Selected mask | Effects during the input in the control | Effects during the assignment through programming | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| INSEE number<br><br>(see the note below) | Only the digits can be typed.<br><br>The first number always corresponds to a '1' or to a '2'.<br><br>up to 13 digits. | All the characters are allowed.<br><br>up to 13 characters. | <br><br>- 2790221241598<br><br>- 1590866795412<br><br><br> |

| The identification numbers used by other countries are also available in WINDEV, WINDEV Mobile and WEBDEV. |


**Reminder**: The INSEE number is used to identify a French individual. This number contains:

- the gender (1: Man, 2: Woman), 

- the last two digits of the year of birth, 

- the month of birth, 

- the region of birth, 

- the INSEE number corresponding to the city of birth, 

- the order number corresponding to the rank of the birth registration on the city records.
	The INSEE number can be completed by a two-digit number called "Key". This key is used to check the validity of the INSEE number.

### "Zip code" masks
<a name="zip_code_masks_ELTPARAGRAPHE000653"></a>

The zip code numbers used by other countries are also available in WINDEV, WINDEV Mobile and WEBDEV.
<a name="NOTE3_9"></a>
**Caution**: Only the following preset masks are supported in a text control found in a report: "1st letter in uppercase", "All in uppercase" and "All in lowercase".

<a name="NOTE4"></a>
<a name="NOTE4_1"></a>


## Custom input masks
<a name="custom_input_masks_ELTTEXTE000990"></a>
The custom  masks can be described via the following characters:

- '9': single digit

- 'C': digit or space character

- 'L': uppercase letter

- 'l': lowercase letter

- 'A': uppercase alphanumeric character

- 'a': lowercase alphanumeric character

- '?': any character




Any other character is reproduced as it is. Therefore, the masks are never wrong.

**Caution**: The custom input masks are only applied to the characters typed. These masks are not applied to the initial values or to the values assigned by programming.

**Remark**: A numeric mask can be described in a text control. The value retrieved will be a numeric character string and not a numeric value.

For example: For a French registration plate, the 'CCCC LL 9A' mask (9A for the 2A and 2B regions) will return a result in the following format: "1245 QD 34".





## File input mask
<a name="file_input_mask_ELTTEXTE001014"></a>
In the case of a "file path" input mask, a help for entering a file path can be enabled during runtime thanks to the "Assisted input of file path" check box below the mask choice:<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=MasqueSaisie_fic_assist.gif)


Remarks:

- This mask is only available for a text control. 

- This mask cannot be applied on the initial value or on the value assigned by programming.

- This option will be ignored if the assisted input on data is enabled.

- ![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This type of mask is not available.





- ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Advancedinputmask.gif) ***Unit examples (WINDEV)*** : **Advanced input mask** <br>Handling the input masks in WINDEV:<br>- Defining the format of positive/negative number in a numeric edit control<br>- Defining how negative numbers will be displayed in a numeric edit control<br>- Defining how the value 0 will be displayed in a numeric edit control<br>- Using a regular expression to prevent from typing characters other than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.<br>- Using a regular expression to "regulate" the input of a French registration number
