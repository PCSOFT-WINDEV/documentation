| Add a shape | Executed when a shape is added in the Diagram Editor control. |
| Select a shape | Executed when a shape is selected in the Diagram Editor control. <br>You can get the characteristics of the selected shape using the [Selection](../Proprietes/1000023033.md) property, which returns a variable of type [diagSelection](../WDLang1/1410088172.md). <br><br>Remark: when creating a shape from a library, the shape is selected. |
| Move a shape | Executed when a shape is moved in the Diagram Editor control. |

| Change a shape | Executed when a shape is modified in the Diagram Editor control (e.g., when the text associated with the shape is validated). |
| Double click on a shape | Executed when a shape is double-clicked in the Diagram Editor control. |
| Whenever modifying | Executed whenever the Diagram Editor control is modified: move shape, add shape, delete shape, etc. |

1. On the "Window" tab, in the "Order" group, click "Initialization".

2. In the window that appears, use the arrows on the right to change the order in which the controls are initialized.
