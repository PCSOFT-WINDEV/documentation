## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000121"></a>
The report editor allows you to create "Crosstab" reports. In this case, there are two possibilities for a WINDEV application: 

- the data source corresponds to multiple data files: a Crosstab report based on a query will be created. 

- the data source corresponds to a Pivot Table control present in a window (example in this page): the report created contains a Pivot Table control. 




When creating a report based on a Pivot Table control from a window, the report contains only a Pivot Table control. This type of control can only be created in this type of report: it cannot be created independently of the report. 

In the editor, this control includes two blocks: 

- The "Header" block that displays the titles of the columns in the Pivot Table. 

- The "Pivot Table" block that displays the titles of the rows and the associated data. 




For more details on the different sources of a "Crosstab" report, see [Crosstab report](../WDChamp/1011062.md).

### Creating the report
<a name="creating_the_report_ELTPARAGRAPHE000031"></a>

To create a "Pivot Table" report: 

1. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_nouveau.gif) in the quick access buttons. 

2. The creation window appears: click "Report" then "Report".

3. The report creation wizard starts. 

4. In this wizard, specify:

	- the type of report to create: "Crosstab".

	- the Pivot Table control used as data source.

	- the skin template of the report (if necessary).

	- the name and title of the report. This name (".WDE". file corresponding to the report) will be used to identify the report in your programs.

## Characteristics of a Pivot Table report and a Pivot Table control

### Characteristics of the Pivot Table (Report editor)

You can change the following characteristics of a Pivot Table report: 

- The data source of the report can be modified in the "Data" tab of the description window of report ("Report description" in the context menu of the report). 

- The "General" tab in the description window of Pivot Table control is used to specify: 

	- **the mode for calculating the width of cells**: the available options are: 

		- Use the width defined in edit mode:  the width of the cells will be the same as the one defined in the report editor.
						Remark: The handles can be used to resize the data area in the Pivot Table control found in the report. 

		- Fill the page as much as possible in width: the cells will be enlarged to fill the available space found in the page.

		- Avoid the truncated cells: the cells will be possibly enlarged to display the entire data if there is enough space in the page.




- **the expanding dimensions**: the available options are: 

	- Like the control: the level of details displayed in the report will be the same as the one displayed in the Pivot Table control used as data source.

	- All expanded: the entire data found in the Pivot Table will be displayed.

	- All collapsed: only the first detailed level of the Pivot Table will be displayed.

- The "Style" tab in the description window of the PVT control is used to define the style of the control: the option "Define the style independently of the printed PVT control" is used to define a specific style for the control found in the report. If this option is checked, you have the ability to specify the style for the row headers and for the data.
