In most cases, a report is linked to a project. To be able to extract the data from the data files, the report editor must know the description of the data files that is stored in the analysis, the analysis being associated with a project.![In this case, a WINDEV analysis is shared between two projects (WINDEV, WINDEV Mobile or WEBDEV).](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P1-Comment-creer-un-etat.gif)


To load a project, on the "Home" tab, in the "General" group, expand "Open" and select "Open a project".
