## Overview of Carousel control
<a name="overview_carousel_control_ELTTEXTE000286"></a>
The Carousel control is used to display an animated menu made of images.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CHP_Carroussel.gif)


**To create a Carousel control**: 

1. On the "Creation" tab, in the "Other controls" group, click "Carousel".

2. Click at the desired location to create the control.




To display the characteristics of the control, select "Description" in the context menu of the control:

- The "General" tab is used to define the orientation, the animation and the background image.

- The "Details" tab is used to define the display mode of the carousel control.

- The "Content" tab is used to define the images displayed in the carousel control as well as their caption.




**Remark**: WINDEV allows you to automatically create a Carousel control from several controls:  

1. Select the controls to include in the Carousel control. 

2. On the "Modification" tab, in the "Transformations" group, expand "Refactoring and swapping" and select "Create a carousel from the selection".




Only the Image controls and the Button controls are taken into account to create this carousel.

## Two modes for using the Carousel control
<a name="two_modes_for_using_the_carousel_control_ELTTEXTE000310"></a>


### Overview
<a name="overview_ELTPARAGRAPHE000061"></a>

To optimize the Carousel control, WINDEV proposes two operating modes:

- Using the .NET 3.0 framework.

- Using the WINDEV framework (GDI+).



<a name="NOTE2_2"></a>


### .NET 3.0 framework
<a name="net_30_framework_ELTPARAGRAPHE000071"></a>

To base the Carousel control on the .Net 3.0 framework, simply check the option "The control is based on the .Net 3.0 framework
(the Xaml functions will also be available for this control)" in the "Details" tab of the control description window.

In this case:

- The functions from the Xaml family are available for this control.

- You can propose to download the .Net 3.0 framework if this one is not installed on the end-user computer. This framework is included in Vista and it can be downloaded for Windows XP (from the Microsoft site).

- The first use of a control that requires the.Net 3.0 framework (Carousel control, Cube control or Xaml control) loads this framework, which may cause delay (out of our control).

- This control consumes a lot of resources: we recommend that you use it on high-performance computers only.




Depending on the configuration of the computer, the display of the Carousel control will be done as follows:


|   |   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|   | **"Download" option checked** | **"Download" option unchecked** |
| **Computer with .NET 3.0 framework** | **Computer without .NET 3.0 framework** | **Computer without .NET 3.0 framework** |
| **Computer with the GDI+ framework** | Using the .NET framework | Using the GDI+ framework | Using the GDI+ framework |
| **Computer without GDI+ framework** | x | Link for downloading the .NET framework<br>Link for displaying a listview | Using a listview (crippled mode) |


**Limitations of the Carousel control in.Net 3.0 mode**: 

- The .Net framework version 3.0 (or later) must be installed on the computer. This framework is included in Vista (and later) and it can be downloaded for Windows XP (from the Microsoft site). 

- The application cannot be started from the network.

- The DDW (Dim Disabled Windows) feature is disabled for all the windows containing a Carousel control.

- This control does not operate under TSE.

- This control uses the wd280xaml.dll library. This library cannot be renamed when creating the executable.

### WINDEV framework (GDI+)
<a name="windev_framework_gdi_ELTPARAGRAPHE000154"></a>

To base the Carousel control on the WINDEV framework, simply check the option "The control is based on the WINDEV framework (GDI+)" in the "Details" tab of the control description window.

In this case, the functions from the Xaml family are not available for this control.

Depending on the configuration of the computer, the display of the Carousel control will be done as follows:


|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   | **Computer with .NET 3.0 framework** | **Computer without .NET 3.0 framework** |
| **Computer with the GDI+ framework** | Using the GDI+ framework | Using the GDI+ framework |
| **Computer without GDI+ framework** | x | Using a listview (crippled mode) |


For more details, see [Installing the GDI+ Framework](../Editeurs/2020007.md).
<a name="NOTE2_4"></a>


### Crippled mode
<a name="crippled_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000204"></a>

The .Net framework version 3.0 (or later) or the WINDEV framework (GDI+) is required to use the Carousel control. However, WINDEV proposes a "crippled" mode for this control so that it can be used regardless of the configuration of the end-user computer. If the .Net 3.0 framework or the WINDEV framework (GDI+) is not installed on the end-user computer, the Carousel control will be automatically replaced with a listview in crippled mode.

**To use this crippled mode in your applications**:

1. Open the description of the Carousel control.

2. In the "Details" tab, you can configure the ListView control used via "ListView control settings".

3. Validate the control description.




The ListView control will be used according to the display mode of the Carousel control and according to the configuration of the user computer (see the previous paragraphs).

### Simulating the absence of .Net 3.0 framework
<a name="simulating_the_absence_net_30_framework_ELTPARAGRAPHE000225"></a>

When developing an application containing a Carousel control, it may be wise to run the test the application on a computer where the .Net framework version 3.0 (or later) is not installed.

To simulate the absence of the framework on a computer:

- use the [XamlDisable](../WDLang1/1000015004.md) function.

- rename the following registry key: "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\.NETFramework\\v3.0".


**Remarks**: A Carousel control that uses the .NET framework can be automatically replaced with a Carousel control that uses the WINDEV framework (GDI+).
