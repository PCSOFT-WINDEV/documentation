## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000082"></a>
WINDEV allows you to handle a Wire control through programming. To do so, use the variable of the Wire control in the code.

To handle a Wire control through programming, WINDEV proposes several functions and properties. 

This help page explains how to handle a Wire control through programming.

### The WLanguage functions
<a name="the_wlanguage_functions_ELTPARAGRAPHE000018"></a>

The following WLanguage functions are used to handle a Wire control: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [AttachPointAdd](../WDLang1/1000021902.md) | Defines an attach point for one of the two extremities of a Wire control. |
| [AttachPointDeleteAll](../WDLang1/1000021903.md) | Deletes all the connection points for a control. |








### Properties specific to the management of a Wire control
<a name="properties_specific_the_management_wire_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000026"></a>

The following properties are used to manage the characteristics of a Wire control through programming: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [AttachPointEnd](../Proprietes/1000021908.md) | The **AttachPointEnd** property is used to get and change the position of the end attachment point of a Wire control. |
| [AttachPointStart](../Proprietes/1000021907.md) | The **AttachPointStart** property is used to get and change the position of the start attachment point of a Wire control. |
| [EndControl](../Proprietes/1000021878.md) | The **EndControl** property is used to determine or change the end control of a Wire control. |
| [MaxNbSegment](../Proprietes/1000021906.md) | The **MaxNbSegment** property is used to get and change the maximum number of line segments for drawing a Wire control. |
| [OriginWaypoint](../Proprietes/1000022161.md) | The **OriginWaypoint** property is used to get and define the origin of points whose coordinates are specified in the [WayPoint](../Proprietes/1000021957.md) property. |
| [ShapeExtremityEnd](../Proprietes/1000021890.md) | The **ShapeExtremityEnd** property is used to identify and change the type of shape used for the end of a Wire control. |
| [ShapeExtremitySize](../Proprietes/1000021960.md) | The **ShapeExtremitySize** property is used to identify and change the size of the shape at the beginning and end of a Wire control. |
| [ShapeExtremityStart](../Proprietes/1000021889.md) | The **ShapeExtremityStart** property is used to get and change the source end shape of a Wire control. |
| [StartControl](../Proprietes/1000021877.md) | The **StartControl** property is used to determine or change the start control of a Wire control. |
| [WayPoint](../Proprietes/1000021957.md) | The **WayPoint** property is used to determine and change the points a Wire control has to pass through. |
