### Page control
<a name="page_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000011"></a>

A Linear Looper control is used to display a set of controls in a horizontal scrolling list.

The Linear Looper control is used to harmoniously display a menu with images for example.

The information displayed in the Linear Looper control can:

- be defined through programming: this is referred to as ***Linear Looper populated programmatically***.

- come from a data file or query: this is referred to as ***Linear Looper control based on a data file***.

- come from a WLanguage variable: this is referred to as ***Linear Looper control based on a variable***.




**Remark**: The Linear Looper control shares numerous characteristics with the Looper control. It is specifically intended to display a small number of elements in order to propose a nice viewing.

## Attributes of a Linear Looper control
<a name="attributes_linear_looper_control_ELTTEXTE000196"></a>
A linear Looper control includes:

- **controls**, that are repeated on each row.

- **attributes**. An attribute is used to define the control characteristic that will be modified on each row. For example, if the value and the color of PRICE control must change on each row, you will have to define two different attributes for the same control.




To find out or modify the characteristic of a control (its value, its color, ...), all you have to do is handle this control or the corresponding attribute by programming.

## Creating a Linear Looper control
<a name="creating_linear_looper_control_ELTTEXTE000220"></a>
To create a Linear Looper control:

1. On the "Creation" tab, in the "Data" group, expand "Looper" and click "Linear Looper".

2. Click where you want to create the control in the page. The Linear Looper control creation wizard starts automatically.




To view the characteristics of the control, select "Description" in the context menu. Two types of information can be viewed:

- the information regarding the entire Looper control (all you have to do is select the name of Looper control).

- the information regarding each attribute of Looper control (all you have to do is select the name of an attribute in the Looper control).

## Vocabulary
<a name="vocabulary_ELTTEXTE000244"></a>
To easily handle a Linear Looper control, you must be familiar with the following vocabulary:

| Name | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Attribute | An attribute corresponds to a modifiable value for each element of the Linear Looper control.<br>An attribute can be linked to a property of a control found in the Linear Looper control to make this property change in all the columns.<br><br>For each attribute, you must define:<br><br>- the attribute name.<br><br>- the name of the control in the linear looper that is linked to the attribute.<br><br>- the property of the control corresponding to the attribute (value, color, ...).<br><br><br> |
| Linear Looper based on a data file | The Linear Looper control is based on a data file or on a query. A record found in the data file is displayed on each row.  Two types of linear Loopers based on a data file are available:<br><br>- ***Linear Looper with in-memory data source***: the content of the linear Looper control is loaded in memory, then displayed. The access to the different elements of the Linear Looper control is faster. This mode is reserved for data files with less than 100,000 records.<br><br>- ***Linear Looper with direct access to the data source (no limit)***: The Linear Looper control displays the content of the data file or query directly. The current record corresponds to the selected element. Selecting an element in the Looper control triggers an access to the linked data file. This type of Linear Looper control is reserved for data files with more than 100,000 records.<br><br><br> |
| Linear Looper populated programmatically | The Linear Looper control is neither based on a data file nor on a query. The elements displayed in the Linear Looper control are defined by the developer (through programming). |
| Linear Looper based on a variable | The Linear Looper control is based on a variable (global to the project or page; class member, etc.). |

### Operations in AJAX
<a name="operations_ajax_ELTPARAGRAPHE000109"></a>

Linear Looper controls cannot be modified in AJAX (addition or deletion of elements).

However, their content can be read from a function or from a process in AJAX mode. Similarly, the processes of the controls displayed by the Linear Looper control can be in AJAX mode.
