## Overview

### Reminder
<a name="reminder_ELTPARAGRAPHE000011"></a>

WINDEV, WINDEV Mobile and WEBDEV propose two types of masks:

- the ***input masks*** that define the characters that can be typed in the controls found in a window or in a page. Sometimes, these masks can also be used to modify the case (uppercase/lowercase characters) of the values assigned to the window controls or to the page controls through programming.

- the ***display masks*** that define the characters that can be: 

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) displayed in the window controls.

	- printed in the report controls.

<a name="NOTE2_1"></a>


## Default mask
<a name="default_mask_ELTTEXTE000357"></a>
By default, when creating a Date control: 

- the "Date defined by the project" input mask is selected: the information defined in the parameters for managing the dates for the project is automatically taken into account. Reminder: These parameters are defined for each language in the "Languages" tab of project description: 

	1. On the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, click "Description".

	2. Select the "Languages" tab then the "Date" tab.

	3. The format used corresponds to:

		- the settings of the operating system, 

		- the specified parameters (with the defined days and months).




- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) the "Same mask as the input" display mask is selected.




Remarks: 

- In a report, when creating a preset Date control, the wizard allows you to select the display format of the control. 

- A list of preset masks is proposed in the description window of the control. You can:

	- select a preset mask.

	- create a custom mask.

## The preset masks
<a name="the_preset_masks_ELTTEXTE000381"></a>
The following masks are proposed (in the order in which they appear in the window editor, page editor or report editor):

- the date defined by the project. The date defined by the project depends on the date format selected in the parameters of the project language ("Project .. Project description", "Language" tab, linguistic options about the date).

- 'DD/MM/YYYY' ("01/02/1979" for example)

- 'DD/MM/YY' ("01/02/79" for example)

- 'DDD DD' ("Tue 15" for example)

- 'MM/DD/YYYY' ("02/01/1979" for example)

- 'MM/DD/YY' ("02/01/79" for example)

- 'YYYY/MM/DD' ("1979/02/01" for example)

- 'YY/MM/DD' ("79/02/01" for example)

- 'DD/MM/YYYY HH:mm:SS' ("01/02/1979 21:35:15" for example)

- 'MM/DD/YYYY HH:mm:SS' ("02/01/1979 21:35:15" for example)

- 'DD/MM/YYYY HH:mm:SS:CC' ("01/02/1979 21:35:15:10" for example)

- 'MM/DD/AAAA HH:mm:SS:CC' ("02/01/1979 21:35:15:10" for example)

- 'DDDD DD MMMM YYYY' ("Thursday 01 february 1979" for example)

- 'Dddd DD Mmmm YYYY' ("Tuesday 13 June 2000" for example)

- 'Dddd DD Mmm YYYY' ("Saturday 01 Dec 2001" for example)




Additional masks are available in WINDEV and WEBDEV: 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Relative duration (yesterday, in 3 days, ...).

### Additional mask
<a name="additional_mask_ELTPARAGRAPHE000173"></a>

In WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile, you have the ability to select an additional display mask: "Relative duration (yesterday, in 3 days, ...)". 

This mask is used to express the duration passed (or the future duration) between the date of the day and the date entered in the control. This format is expressed in natural language. 

The different formulations used can be configured in the project description for the current language:

1. On the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, click "Description".

2. In the "Languages" tab:

	- select the language to configure.

	- select the "Date" tab.




3. Click the "Dates and Times in natural language" button.

4. Define (if necessary) the custom captions to use. These captions will be used:

	- for the result of [DateToString](../WDLang1/3027025.md) (used with the *maskDateRelativeDuration* constant).

	- for the Date edit controls that use the "Relative duration" display mask.

## The custom masks
<a name="the_custom_masks_ELTTEXTE000417"></a>
The following elements can be used to define a custom mask (case sensitive):

- 'DDDD' (corresponding day of the week, "Thursday" for example. The case used depends on the linguistic options of the project.)

- 'Dddd' (corresponding day of the week with the first letter in uppercase, for example: Monday)
	![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This notation is not available.

- 'dddd' (corresponding day of the week with the first letter in lowercase, for example: monday)
	![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This notation is not available.

- 'DDD' (abbreviation of the day of the week, "Thu" for example)

- 'Ddd' (abbreviation of the day of the week with the first letter in uppercase, for example: Mon)
	![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This notation is not available.

- 'ddd' (abbreviation of the day of the week with the first letter in lowercase, for example: mon)
	![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This notation is not available.

- 'DD' (date in digits, "25" for example)

- 'MMMM' (month spelled out, "January" for example. The case used depends on the linguistic options of the project.)

- 'Mmmm' (month spelled out with the first letter in uppercase, for example: January)
	![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This notation is not available.

- 'mmmm' (month spelled out with the first letter in lowercase, for example: january)
	![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This notation is not available.

- 'MMM' (abbreviation of the month, "Jan" for example)

- 'Mmm' (abbreviation of the month with the first letter in uppercase, for example: Jan)
	![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This notation is not available.

- 'mmm' (abbreviation of the month with the first letter in lowercase, for example: jan)
	![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This notation is not available.

- 'MM' (month in digits, "06" for example)

- 'YYYY' (year on four digits, "2001" for example)

- 'YY' (last two digits of the year, "01" for example)

- 'HH' (hour in digits, "13" for example)

- 'mm' (minutes in digits, "32" for example)

- 'SS' (seconds in digits, "46" for example)




These masks can be combined. For example: 'DDD DD MMMM YYYY at HH:mm' will return a result in the following format: "Fri 02 February 1979 at 21:35".
