## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000183"></a>
The "Internal Window" control is used to display an existing internal window. Several operations can be performed on the Internal Window control by programming.

**Caution: Do not confuse "Internal Window control" and "Internal window": the "Internal window" control is a type of control while the "Internal window" is a type of window.**

## Programming in WLanguage
<a name="programming_wlanguage_ELTTEXTE000207"></a>


### Available functions and properties
<a name="available_functions_and_properties_ELTPARAGRAPHE000041"></a>

The following WLanguage functions and properties are available:

- WLanguage functions:
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [ChangeSourceWindow](../WDLang1/3038053.md) | Dynamically changes the window displayed in an Internal Window control. During this modification, parameters can be passed to the new internal window. |
| [WinUsefulSize](../WDLang1/1000017089.md) | Dynamically changes the useful size of the internal window displayed in an Internal Window control.<br> |



- WLanguage property:
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [SourceWindow](../Proprietes/2511020.md) | Used to find out the source of an internal window (which means the internal window displayed by the Internal Window control). |

### Passing parameters to an internal window
<a name="passing_parameters_internal_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000086"></a>

To pass parameters to an internal window, we advise you to:

1. Create an initialization procedure in the internal window.

2. Call this procedure in the window that contains the "Internal Window" control.Example:





```wl
// -- Initialization code of WIN_Window1
// IW_MyInternalWin is a control of WIN_Window1
// That is linked to an internal window 
// This internal window includes a procedure named Init()
IW_MyInternalWin.Init(Param1, Param2)
```
**Remark**: [ChangeSourceWindow](../WDLang1/3038053.md) is used to dynamically change the internal window displayed in an Internal Window control. During this modification, you have the ability to pass parameters to the internal window.

### Operating mode of groups of controls
<a name="operating_mode_groups_controls_ELTPARAGRAPHE000102"></a>

The groups of controls are global to the window and to its internal windows. The groups of controls found in two internal windows displayed in the same window are not differentiated.

Therefore, hiding a group of controls found in an internal window can also hide the controls found in another internal window if the internal windows use the same name for the groups of controls.

## Example: File picker created via an internal window
<a name="example_file_picker_created_via_internal_window_ELTTEXTE000243"></a>


### Getting the default value of the file picker
<a name="getting_the_default_value_the_file_picker_ELTPARAGRAPHE000113"></a>

**To get** the default value of the file picker in the internal window:

1. In the initialization code of the host window for example, initialize the value of the internal window:
	
	```wl
	IW_InternalWindow1 = "C:\temp"
	```


2. In the "Set the Value property" event of the internal window, retrieve the value and assign it to the Edit control of the file picker: 
	
	```wl
	EDT_DirEdit = Myself.Value
	```

### Transmitting the value typed in the internal window
<a name="transmitting_the_value_typed_the_internal_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000127"></a>

**To transmit** the value typed by the user to the host window:

1. In the "Get the Value property" of the internal window, enter:
	
	```wl
	RESULT EDT_DirEdit
	```


2. In the host window, retrieve the value of the internal window control:
	
	```wl
	Info(IW_InternalWindow1.Value)
	```
