### Principle of inheritance and override
<a name="principle_inheritance_and_override_ELTPARAGRAPHE000011"></a>

When a window template is applied to a window, all the controls and code found in the template are "copied" into the window. This is the concept of **inheritance**.

The template controls are visible in the window, in the window editor. A yellow square is found in the upper-left corner of each control. By default, the controls found in the template cannot be modified.

The template code is visible in the code editor, in the different events of the window or its controls. This WLanguage code can be easily identified: 

- the events associated with the template are followed by "(&lt;Template name&gt; template)" (for example: "*Click the Validate button (MyTemplate template)*").

- the background of the events is grayed because the code cannot be modified.




For a template of templates, the inheritance is performed on several levels.

You can **override** controls, local procedures and the code of the template. Overriding controls, local procedures and the code enables you to modify, for a given window, the code, the local procedures and/or the controls of the template.

## Overriding windows
<a name="overriding_windows_ELTTEXTE000237"></a>


### Overriding window properties
<a name="overriding_window_properties_ELTPARAGRAPHE000031"></a>

Overriding the properties of the template windows consists in modifying the characteristics of the window that uses the template (the characteristics displayed in the description window for example).

As soon as one of the characteristics of the window that uses the template is modified (the width of the window for example), this property is overridden.

**Remark**: The template window can use a skin template with "Layout" controls (the ActiveVista template for example). These controls are used to display the title of the window, the system buttons, ... These layout controls are considered as being properties of the window.

### Overriding the code of the windows
<a name="overriding_the_code_the_windows_ELTPARAGRAPHE000042"></a>

To override the code of template windows:

1. Open the events of the window (select "Code" in the context menu).

2. If an event exists in the template window, this event appears twice in the window that uses the template. Indeed, the following elements are displayed:

	- the event from the template. This event appears in gray and its caption is followed by "(&lt;Template name&gt; template)".

	- the window event.




3. The code typed in the window event will be run as follows:  

	- the "Global declarations" event is merged between the template and the window that uses the template. Therefore, variables with the same name must not be used in this event.

	- for all the events (except the window closing event): the events of templates applied to the window are run in the order in which they were included, then the event corresponding to the window is run.

	- for the window closing event: the window closing event is run, then the events of templates applied to the window are run in the reverse order in which they were included.

## Overriding controls
<a name="overriding_controls_ELTTEXTE000267"></a>


### Overriding the control style (UI override)
<a name="overriding_the_control_style_override_ELTPARAGRAPHE000062"></a>

To override the interface of a template control (a button for example):

1. Display the popup menu of a template button found in the window.

2. Select "Override control".

3. The yellow square was replaced with a blue square, indicating that this control can be overridden.

4. You can now modify all the aspects of the button interface: dimensions, position, style, ... <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ModeleFen_IHMModifiee.gif)

### Overriding the control code (code override)
<a name="overriding_the_control_code_code_override_ELTPARAGRAPHE000081"></a>

To override the code of a template control (code of a button for example):

1. Display the popup menu of a template button found in the window.

2. Select "Override control".

3. The yellow square was replaced with a blue square, indicating that this control can be overridden.

4. Display the button code ("Code" in the context menu).

5. Two sections of click code are found: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ModeleFen_CodeNonSurcharge.gif)


	- the click code issued from the template.

- the click code of the window. A function was automatically added: [ExecuteAncestor](../WDLang1/3013063.md). This procedure runs the click code of template.

6. Add the code of the button specific to the current window, before and/or after the procedure for calling the template code. You have the ability to delete [ExecuteAncestor](../WDLang1/3013063.md) if you do not want the template code to be run.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ModeleFen_CodeSurcharge.gif)

### Remarks
<a name="remarks_ELTPARAGRAPHE000106"></a>

- An overridden button cannot be deleted from a template.

- Overriding a table also overrides the columns. You have the ability to add columns into an inherited table.

- You have the ability to add panes to a template tab and to include template controls in this pane.

- Style override is not available.

## Managing overridden properties of a control
<a name="managing_overridden_properties_control_ELTTEXTE000303"></a>


### Finding out the overridden properties:
<a name="finding_out_the_overridden_properties_ELTPARAGRAPHE000118"></a>

To find out the control properties that have been overridden:

1. Open the popup menu of control.

2. Select "Overridden properties".

3. The override management window opens.




This window allows you to delete overridden properties. To do so, select the requested property and delete it.

To entirely delete the overridden operations performed on a control, simply select "Full override".





## Overriding local procedures
<a name="overriding_local_procedures_ELTTEXTE000327"></a>


### Overriding the code of a local procedure
<a name="overriding_the_code_local_procedure_ELTPARAGRAPHE000135"></a>

To override the code of a local procedure from the "Project explorer" pane:

1. Select the element associated with the local procedure (window, page, report, etc.).

2. Expand the element options and select "Local procedures".

3. Select the procedure to override.

4. Open the context menu and select "Override code of local procedure".

5. Two sections of click code are found: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=heritage_surcharge_proc.gif)


	- the code of the procedure issued from the template.

- the code of the new procedure. A function was automatically added: [ExecuteAncestor](../WDLang1/3013063.md). This function runs the code of the template procedure.

6. Add the code of the new procedure specific to the current element, before and/or after the procedure for calling the template code. You have the ability to delete [ExecuteAncestor](../WDLang1/3013063.md) if you do not want the template code to be run.
	**Caution**: the prototype of the overridden procedure must be identical to the prototype of the new procedure.

## Limitations
<a name="limitations_ELTTEXTE000351"></a>


- No embedded query can be used in a template control. The execution of the window that uses the template will trigger an error.

- No menu can be used in a template: the menu will not be copied into the window that uses the template.

- Style override is not available.
