## Default events
<a name="default_events_ELTTEXTE000400"></a>
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) **WINDEV** and **WINDEV Mobile** manage the following events by default (order of appearance in the code editor):

| Event | Runtime condition |
| --- | --- |
| Initialization | Executed when the window is opened. (\*)<br><br>**Special case: Table control based on a data file filled automatically**<br>When this code is run, the Table control is not filled yet. To force the Table control to be filled in this code, use:<br><br>- the [TableDisplay](../WDLang1/3074003.md) function,<br><br>- the Table control based on a data file management properties: [BrowsedFile](../Proprietes/2510040.md), [BrowsedItem](../Proprietes/2510111.md) or [Filter](../Proprietes/2510042.md).<br><br><br><br><br>You can also filter records with [HFilter](../WDLang4/3044100.md). |
| End of initialization | Code only for automatically populated Table controls based on a data file:<br><br>Executed after the Table control has been populated. This code is used to select an element in the Table control, to add or modify an element. |
| Entry in the Table control | Run when the control takes focus. |
| Exit from the Table control | Run when moving from one control to another (TAB key, selecting another control with the mouse, etc.). |
| Entry in edit in a row of the Table control | Run when the user selects a row to perform an input in this row. |
| Exit from a row of the Table control | Run when moving from one row or control to another (TAB key, selecting another control with the mouse, etc.).<br><br>In this code, the current row corresponds to the row that was selected beforehand.<br><br>**Caution: Table control with Check Box column**:  simply modifying the check box does not run the row exit code. If a user clicks a check box column, WINDEV does not consider this as entering the row in edit mode . The "Entry in input in a row" and "Exit from a row" events are not executed. To manage this case, it is recommended to use the column modification code. <br><br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) In this code, the current row corresponds to the new selected row. |
| Displaying a row of the Table control | Run when a new row must be displayed in the Table control: redisplaying the Table control, scrolling or moving in the Table control, etc, ...<br><br>This event is also run when column is assigned. If several columns are assigned through programming, the display code will be run several times. <br>**Tip**: To modify several columns, use [TableModifyLine](../WDLang1/3074028.md) rather than the direct assignment.<br><br> |
| Selecting a row of the Table control | Run when the user selects a row (without input).<br><br>This event is also run when the user clicks a cell whose selection mode is set to "Single selection" or: Multi-selection". |
|   | This event is automatically added when the "Pull to refresh" feature is enabled ("Details" tab in the description window of the Table control). <br><br>This event is run when a refresh gesture is detected on the Table control. <br><br>At the end of this event, the refresh bar will be automatically hidden except if [TableRefreshVisible](../WDLang1/1000021196.md) has been called.<br><br>For more details, see [Pull to Refresh on Table and Looper controls (Android/iOS)](../WDChamp/9000156.md). |
| ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Filter records (optional event) | **Code only for automatically populated Table controls based on a data file**:<br>Run just before displaying a row. This event filters the records displayed in the Table control. This event is detailed at the end of this page. |
| ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Drag and Drop management events (optional events) | **Code only for Table controls populated programmatically and Table controls based on a variable**: <br>These events are used to simplify the management of programmed Drag and Drops. The available events are:<br><br>- Beginning of source drag/drop.<br><br>- End of source drag/drop.<br><br>- Entry in target drag/drop.<br><br>- Rollover in target drag/drop.<br><br>- Drop in target drag/drop.<br><br>- Exit from target drag/drop.<br><br><br>**Remark**: If one of these events contains some code, the Drag and Drop feature is not automatically managed for Table controls: the Drag and Drop in the Table control must be managed through programming |
| Scrolling events (optional events) | These events make it easy to manage the vertical scrollbar in the control. The available events are:<br><br>- Start scrolling: Executed when the vertical scrollbar of the control starts moving. <br><br>- While scrolling: Executed while the vertical scrollbar of the control moves.  <br><br>- Stop scrolling: Executed when the vertical scrollbar of the control stops moving. <br><br><br><br><br>Remark: [ScrollbarPosition](../WDLang1/1000021057.md) gets the position of the scrollbar. |


(\*) By default, the "Initializing" event of each control is executed according to the order in which the controls were created in the window. To modify this order of execution: 

1. On the "Window" tab, in the "Order" group, click "Initialization". 

2. In the window that appears, use the arrows on the right to change the order in which the controls are initialized.

## Optional events
<a name="optional_events_ELTTEXTE000430"></a>
Several optional events are supported.
To add an optional event:

1. Select the desired control.

2. Display the code window of this control (F2 key).

3. Click the link "Add other events to xxx" at the bottom of the window code, after the last event.  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Traitements_optionnels_WD_OK%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)


4. All the optional events available for the control are displayed. 

5. Check the optional event to add and validate. 
	Remark: You can select several optional events. 

6. The selected optional event is automatically added to the events managed by the control.




To disable an optional event, simply perform the same operations to display the list of optional events. Then simply uncheck the optional events to delete. 
Remark: If the disabled code contains WLanguage code, this code is automatically deleted.You can manage, for example:

- the mouse hover over the control,

- left mouse button down, up, double click,

- right mouse button down, up, double click, 

- mouse wheel, etc.




**Remark**: The optional events differ according to the environment (WINDEV, WEBDEV, WINDEV Mobile) and the development platform.

## Filter records (Table based on a data file only)
<a name="filter_records_table_based_data_file_only_ELTTEXTE000470"></a>
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) The "Filter records" event is executed after a row of the Table control is displayed. Therefore, it is run:

- when initializing the Table control.

- whenever a row is displayed in the Table control.




This event filters the records displayed in the Table control. 

To implement a filter, the "Filter records" event must return a value:

- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> to specify that the record matches to the filter and that it must be displayed.

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> to specify that the record does not match the filter and that it must not be displayed.

- <u><u><u><u>Cancel</u></u></u></u> to stop reading the data source of the table (very rare case).




Example:


```wl
// -- Filter the records
// Displays the customers who placed orders exceeding 3000 Euros
IF Orders.TotalIOT >=3000 THEN 
	RETURN True
ELSE
	RESULT False
END
```
In this code, the data used affects the record currently read by the Table control. This data comes from the data file or query linked to the Table control.

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) If an automatic filter is applied on the Table control ([TableEnableFilter](../WDLang1/1000017149.md) or filter enabled by the user directly), the filter defined by the event "Filter records" is combined with the automatic filter. Remark: In WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile, the event "Recording the records" is an optional event. In WEBDEV, this event is proposed by default.

## Before displaying the automatic tooltip of scrollbar
<a name="before_displaying_the_automatic_tooltip_scrollbar_ELTTEXTE000494"></a>
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) In Windows, the tooltip for the scrollbar in a Table control is displayed when the user clicks the "box" of the vertical scrollbar. 
This tooltip contains the following information by default: 

- Range of rows currently displayed in the Table control. 

- Total number of rows in the Table control.

- Information about the element currently displayed in the first row of the Table control in the sorted column. 


The event "Before displaying the automatic tooltip of the scrollbar" is run just before the tooltip is displayed. This allows displaying a specific text in the tooltip using the [ToolTip](../Proprietes/2510005.md) property, for example.
