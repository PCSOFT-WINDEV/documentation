In this chart:

**1.** **Point with its value.**
The point value is displayed if the following conditions are fulfilled:

- "Show values" is checked in the "Details" tab of the Chart control description.

- the type of point is defined for each series in the "Series" tab of the point description window. If the type of point is "Not drawn", the point will not be highlighted and its value will not be displayed.




The size of the points is defined in the "General" tab of the control description window.  

**2. Title of axes**. 
The title of horizontal and vertical axes is displayed if the title was defined in the "General" tab of the Chart control description. This parameter can also be defined through programming with [grAxisTitle](../WDLang3/3042057.md).

**3. Chart title**. 
The characteristics of the chart title can be defined in the "Details" tab of the control description ("Edit chart title").
You can define the chart title, its position and style.

- define a specific mark.

- define a scale on the X-axis according to the time. This option operates with Date or DateTime data coming from a Table control or from an HFSQL item. This option cannot be used with a series filled through programming.

- define a logarithmic scale on the Y axis.




You also have the ability to use the secondary scale for one or more series ("Series" tab).

**8. Gridlines**. 
To display the gridlines, select "Gridlines" and "Gridlines" in the "General" tab of the control description.

**9. Scrollbars used to perform a zoom**. 
The ability to zoom in a chart can be defined in the "Details" tab the of control description. This option is available in WINDEV only.
