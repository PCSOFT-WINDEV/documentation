## Creating a report (via a wizard)
<a name="creating_report_via_wizard_ELTTEXTE000427"></a>
<a name="Create_report"></a>
To create a report:

1. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_nouveau.gif) in the quick access buttons. 

	- The new element window appears: click "Report" then "Report".

	- The report creation wizard starts.




2. In the different steps of the wizard, specifiy:

	- the type of report you want to create (form, table, etc.). For more details, see [Types of reports](../WDChamp/1011054.md).

	- the report data source (data file, query, etc.). For more details, see [Report data source](../WDChamp/1011055.md).

	- the elements of the report: 

		- [Sort: Data printing order](#NOTE3_3). 

		- [Breaks](#NOTE3_3). 

		- Items / controls to be displayed. 

		- [Calculations (sum, average, etc.)](#NOTE3_4). 

		- [Paper size](#NOTE3_5).

		- Availability of the report in Reports and Queries.

		- [Skin template of the report](#NOTE3_6). 

		- Name of the report. 




3. Validate the report creation. The report is generated and saved according to the selected options.




These different steps are completed in the report creation wizard. A report with to the selected options is automatically created at the end of the wizard. The created report appears in edit in the report editor. The different blocks and controls of your report have been created. They can be modified according to your own requirements. Most of the options chosen when creating the report can be modified thereafter.

Then, the report can be run:

- from the report editor, 

- from a WINDEV application, 

- from a WINDEV Mobile application (for iOS or Android),

- from a WEBDEV site.

### The available data sources
<a name="the_available_data_sources_ELTPARAGRAPHE000134"></a>

The data source of report defines the origin of data printed in the report. Several data sources are available. These data sources can be selected in the report creation wizard or in the report description window. 

The available data sources are as follows:

- **Existing data file**: The data to be printed comes from a data file described in the project analysis. This data file can be in any format (HFSQL Classic, Oracle, etc.).
	|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ER.png) | Important | The data files and the file items that can be used in the reports created with Reports & Queries are defined by the developer in the data model editor. For more details on the requirements to use a WINDEV application with Reports and Queries, see [Distributing Reports & Queries](../Presentation/3088002.md). |








- **Query**: The data to be printed comes from a query. This query corresponds to:

	- a query that was previously created and saved in the query editor.

	- a new query that will be built when the report is created.




- **Table, TreeView Table, Organizer, Scheduler or Looper control** in a window or page: The data to be printed comes from a specific control found in one of the application windows or in one of the site pages. The records are selected by the control and they are printed by the report.
	|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ER.png) | Important | Reports & Queries cannot be used to create reports based on Table, TreeView Table, Organizer, Scheduler or Looper controls. However, you can customize reports based on these types of controls, if they were created in the standard report editor (color, font, size, linked column, etc.) |








- **Existing variable** : The data to be printed comes from a WLanguage variable found in the project or in the report. This variable can be a simple array, a class member, a structure member or an advanced variable member. 
	|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ER.png) | Important | Reports & Queries cannot be used to create or modify reports on variable. |








- **No data source**: The report will be linked to no data source.




- **Other available data sources**

	- **Text file**: The data to print is read in a text file.

	- **Memory area populated programmatically (not available in WINDEV Mobile)**: The data to print corresponds to the records stored in a memory area.
			|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ER.png) | Important | Reports & Queries cannot be used to create reports on a memory area. However, you can customize reports based on a memory area, if they were created in the standard report editor (color, font, size, etc.). |





	- **HFSQL view**: The data to be printed comes from an HFSQL view in an HFSQL Classic data file.
			|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ER.png) | Important | Reports & Queries cannot be used to create reports on an HFSQL view. However, you can customize reports based on an HFSQL view, if they were created in the standard report editor (color, font, size, etc.). |





	- **Programmed reading of the data source**: To manually program and select the records that will be displayed in the report, choose a report based on a programmed data source. 
			|   |   |   |

| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ER.png) | Important | Reports & Queries cannot be used to create reports on a programmed data source. |











These data sources are presented in [Data sources](../WDChamp/1011055.md).

**Remark**: If one of the above-mentioned data sources is selected, the records that will be displayed in the report are automatically selected by the report editor.
To manually program and select the records that will be displayed in the report, choose a report with programmed reading of data source.

### Breaks and sorts
<a name="breaks_and_sorts_ELTPARAGRAPHE000207"></a>

The breaks and the sorts are used to define the sort order of data printed in the report as well as the options for grouping data.

- If the report is based on a data file, the search items of data file are automatically proposed as sort items.

- If the report is based on a query, the sorts performed in the query are automatically proposed for the breaks.

- If the report is based on a variable, only the breaks can be defined: the sorts must be performed through programming.




**The sort**
To make the result of a query easier to read, the records can be sorted according to one or more items. Sorting the records means classifying them in an ascending order or in descending order.
For example, the customers can be sorted by name, from A to Z.
If your report is based on a query, the sort order is defined when creating the query. However, you can:

- add or delete a sort item to/from an existing report.

- modify the sort order performed on an item in an existing report.


To improve the sort, you also have the ability to use:

- WLanguage functions ([Left](../WDLang1/3024001.md), [Right](../WDLang1/3024016.md), etc.).

- a WLanguage procedure (server procedure in WEBDEV). This procedure will be automatically called to sort the records displayed in the report. This procedure must be a global procedure of project or a local procedure of report. For more details, see [Sort procedure](../WDChamp/1011035.md).




**The breaks**
The break is used to group the records corresponding to the same sort argument.
For example: 

- to list the stock price by day, all you have to do is sort the stocks by date and perform a break on the date.

- to list the customers and the companies by city, sort the customers by city then by company name, and perform a break on the city.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=EtatRupture.gif&type=thumb)





Adding a break automatically generates the Start of break and End of break blocks. These blocks are used to:

- display the content of the break item (usually in the Start of break block).

- perform calculations on the records in the break (usually in the End of break block).


The report editor proposes two types of breaks:

- ***automatic break*** (the most common one). The break is performed on an item belonging to the data source of report.

- ***programmed break***. The break is defined programmatically in the "Value of break" event of the Start of break block. For more details, see [Breaks in a report](../WDChamp/1011028.md).

### Performing calculations in a report
<a name="performing_calculations_report_ELTPARAGRAPHE000282"></a>

You can perform different calculations on the numeric data from the report. For example, in a report used to list the orders per customer, you can calculate and display the average value of the customer orders.

**Remark**: The different calculations performed in a report are defined when the report is created. However, new calculations can be added to the created report via the calculated controls.
<a name="NOTE3_5"></a>


### Skin template
<a name="skin_template_ELTPARAGRAPHE000291"></a>

If the project is associated with a skin template (or with a template), this skin template (or this template) can be selected for your reports. Your printed reports and your application will have the same style. This skin template (or template) can be modified once the report is created.

Caution: Depending on the type of printer, the reports containing images may take quite a long time to print.
<a name="NOTE3_6"></a>


### Print format of the report
<a name="print_format_the_report_ELTPARAGRAPHE000300"></a>

The format of a report is used to configure:

- the report orientation.

- the paper format.

- the print margins.

- the number of columns in the report. By default, a report contains one column. If the report contains more than one column, the report is said to be "multi-column".




For a "Label" report, you also have the ability to configure:

- the format of the label sheet.

- the spacing between the labels.




This information can be modified after the report creation. For more details, see [Describing and handling a report](../WDChamp/1011071.md). 
<a name="NOTE3_7"></a>


### Saving a report
<a name="saving_report_ELTPARAGRAPHE000322"></a>

To save a report: 

- on the "Home" tab, in the "General" group, click "Save".

- click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_Enregistrer.gif) in the quick access buttons.


The extension of the created report file is ".WDE".

The report is automatically included in the list of project elements.

If you are using the report editor, the reports will be included in the library: 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) when creating the executable.
