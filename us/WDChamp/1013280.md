### Control in a dynamic page
<a name="control_dynamic_page_ELTPARAGRAPHE000011"></a>

The "Internal Page" control is used to include a page (and its code) in a control of another page.

At runtime, the page to merge ("Internal Page") will be dynamically merged with the host page.

The "Internal page" control enables you to dynamically share the same section of the interface in one or more sites. The page to merge (internal page) can also come from a component.

**Caution: Do not confuse "Internal Page control" and "Internal page": the "Internal page" control is a type of control while the "Internal page" is a type of page.**

To create an internal page:

1. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_nouveau.gif)
 in the quick access buttons. The creation window appears: click "Page" then "Page". The page creation wizard starts.

2. Click "Internal Page" and select "Blank".

3. Validate to create the internal page.




An internal page corresponds to a specific type of page. The internal page contains no border, no title bar and no background image. It is intended to be displayed in an "Internal page" control.

This type of page is also called "Source page".

## Remarks

### Differences between an Internal Page control and a page template
<a name="differences_between_internal_page_control_and_page_template_ELTPARAGRAPHE000069"></a>

- Using an "Internal page" control is recommended for teamwork. Modifying an internal page does not cause all the pages that use it to refresh (unlike templates).

- Using an "Internal page" control is recommended if the controls to display in the target page must be grouped. The templates are used to define the page outline. With the templates, the controls found in the template can be used anywhere in the page.

### Limitations
<a name="limitations_ELTPARAGRAPHE000077"></a>

- No internal page coming from a component can be used in a static page. Only the internal pages of the project are allowed.
