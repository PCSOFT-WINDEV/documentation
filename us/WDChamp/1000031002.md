## Default events
<a name="default_events_ELTTEXTE000268"></a>
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile manage the following events by default (order of appearance in the code editor):

| Event | Runtime condition |
| --- | --- |
| Initializing | Executed when the window is opened. \*<br><br>Widgets added through programming must be added in this event ([DashAddWidget](../WDLang1/1000020953.md) then [DashInitialConfiguration](../WDLang1/1000021043.md)). |
| Adding a widget | Run once a widget was added via the context menu of Dashboard control in edit mode. |
| Deleting a widget | Run when hiding a widget via the context menu of Dashboard control in edit mode.<br><br>- If this event does not return a value or returns <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>, the widget will be hidden.<br><br>- If this event returns <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>, the widget will not be hidden.<br><br><br> |
| Moving a widget | Run once a Widget was moved in the Dashboard control in edit mode. |
| Resizing a widget | Run once a Widget was resized in the Dashboard control in edit mode. |


(\*) By default, the "Initializing" event of each control is executed according to the order in which the controls were created in the window. To modify this order of execution: 

1. On the "Window" tab, in the "Order" group, click "Initialization".

2. In the window that appears, use the arrows on the right to change the order in which the controls are initialized.

## Events with procedures
<a name="events_with_procedures_ELTTEXTE000298"></a>
To simplify the operations performed on widgets in a Dashboard control, several procedures are proposed in each event. These procedures take as parameter the widget variable to use. This variable is a [Control](../WDLang1/1000020967.md) variable. The widget can be handled by this variable. 

**Example**: To find tout the Widgets deleted by the user: 
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) 
```wl
PROCEDURE DeleteWidget(Widget is Control)
Trace("Deletion" + Widget.Caption)
Trace("Deletion" + Widget.SourceWindow)
```

<a name="NOTE3_1"></a>


## Optional events
<a name="optional_events_ELTTEXTE000322"></a>
Several optional events are supported.
To add an optional event:

1. Select the desired control.

2. Display the code window of this control (F2 key).

3. Click the link "Add other events to xxx" at the bottom of the window code, after the last event.  ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Traitements_optionnels_WD_OK%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)


4. All the optional events available for the control are displayed. 

5. Check the optional event to add and validate. 
	Remark: You can select several optional events. 

6. The selected optional event is automatically added to the events managed by the control.




To disable an optional event, simply perform the same operations to display the list of optional events. Then simply uncheck the optional events to delete. 
Remark: If the disabled code contains WLanguage code, this code is automatically deleted.You can manage, for example:

- the mouse hover over the control,

- left mouse button down, up, double click,

- right mouse button down, up, double click, 

- mouse wheel, etc.




For more details, see the [Optional events](../WDChamp/1014004.md).

## Widget optional events
<a name="widget_optional_events_ELTTEXTE000362"></a>
Widgets are internal windows displayed in a Dashboard control. 

In this case, a specific optional event can be associated with the internal window or page: "Refresh widget". 

This event is run when [DashDisplay](../WDLang1/1000020970.md) is run.
