WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile manage the following events by default (order of appearance in the code editor):


| Event | Runtime condition |
| --- | --- |
| Initializing | Executed when the window is opened. (\*)<br><br>**Special case:  automatically filled browsing Combo Box**:<br>When this code is executed, the Combo Box control is not populated yet. To force the control to be populated in this event, use:<br><br>- the [ListDisplay](../WDLang1/3049005.md) function,<br><br>- the properties for handling Combo Box controls based on a data file: [BrowsedFile](../Proprietes/2510040.md), [BrowsedItem](../Proprietes/2510111.md) or [Filter](../Proprietes/2510042.md).<br><br><br> |
| End of initialization | **Code present only in automatically populated Combo Box controls based on a data file**: <br>Executed once the Combo Box control has been populated. This code allows you to select, add or modify an element in the control. |

| Exit | Executed when moving from one control to another (TAB key, selecting another control with the mouse, etc.) |
| Whenever modiying | **Code present only in editable Combo Box controls**: <br>Executed when the user enters data in an editable Combo Box control. |
| Selecting a row | Executed when the user selects an element in the row or modifies the selected element. |

1. On the "Window" tab, in the "Order" group, click "Initialization". 

2. In the window that appears, use the arrows on the right to change the order in which the controls are initialized.
