In most cases, several popup menus are included in your applications.

One or more menus can be shared between several windows of your application. All you have to do is use the window templates.

The principle is straightforward, you must:

1. Create a specific window template. This window template contains the popup menu to share.

2. Apply the window template to the windows that use the popup menu: the popup menus defined in the template will be available in the window.




Therefore, the popup menus can be overloaded in order to adapt to a specific window without affecting the other windows.
