## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000107"></a>
WINDEV allows you to apply a transparency coefficient to the windows.

This feature is very useful. It is used to display an alert window or a warning window "above" another window, without stopping the current process.

Let's imagine a monitoring application: whenever an alert occurs, it opens a transparent window displaying a message while the window found underneath remains active and visible.

Let's imagine how you could track urgent emails, monitor assembly lines, ...

<a name="modifying_the_transparency_windows_ELTPARAGRAPHE000024"></a>

The transparency of windows can be modified:

- [in the window editor](#NOTE2_2).

- [through programming](#NOTE2_3).

### Modifying the opacity of a window in edit
<a name="modifying_the_opacity_window_edit_ELTPARAGRAPHE000038"></a>

To modify the opacity of a window:

1. Display the window description of current window ("Description" in the context menu of window).

2. Display the "Style" tab and define the opacity level of window: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Transparence%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)



This level can change from 0 (transparent window) to 100 (opaque window).

### Modifying the window opacity through programming
<a name="modifying_the_window_opacity_through_programming_ELTPARAGRAPHE000051"></a>

The window opacity can also be modified through programming with [Opacity](../Proprietes/2514006.md).

Example: Display effects when closing a window:


```wl
// Make the window invisible little by little (fade out)
i is int
FOR i = 1 TO 100
	WIN_EditWindow.Opacity = 100 - I
END
Close()
```
