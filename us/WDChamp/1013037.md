### Control in a window or in a dynamic page
<a name="control_window_dynamic_page_ELTPARAGRAPHE000011"></a>

The TreeView control is a tree structure used to simplify the display of information that can be represented hierarchically.

The TreeView control is often used to represent the tree structure of a disk, directory, etc.

## Creating a TreeView control
<a name="creating_treeview_control_ELTTEXTE000235"></a>
To create a TreeView control: 

1. On the "Creation" tab, in the "Data" group, click "TreeView".

2. Click where the control will be created in the window or page. The control appears in the editor.




To view the characteristics of the control, select "Description" in the context menu.

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) The "Style" tab is used to define several characteristics such as: 

- color of even and odd rows.

- image of hovered row.

- image of selected row.

- image and configuration of "+" and "-" buttons.

- checkmark style.

### Context menu proposed automatically
<a name="context_menu_proposed_automatically_ELTPARAGRAPHE000060"></a>

The TreeView control can display a specific popup menu proposing automatic features to the user. This menu is proposed by the AAF (Automatic Application Features). 

This menu allows the user to: 

- copy the content of the row or column. 

- expand or collapse all: This option is used to expand or collapse all the elements of the current branch. 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) export the content of the TreeView control to Excel, Word, etc. 




For more details, see [Context menu of TreeView controls (AAF)](../WDChamp/1013273.md).

## Vocabulary associated with the TreeView control
<a name="vocabulary_associated_with_the_treeview_control_ELTTEXTE000271"></a>
To handle a TreeView control, you must be familiar with some definitions: ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Arbre_Vocabulaire.gif)


| Name | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Branch | Section of the TreeView control that can define a path:<br><br>- from the root to a leaf<br><br>- from a node to another node<br><br>- from a node to a leaf<br><br>- from the root to a node.<br><br><br> |
| Element | Generic name corresponding to the content of a TreeView control. Root, Node and Leaf are elements of a TreeView control |
| Sheet | Last element of the tree structure: there is no level below. |
| Node | Intermediate level, can have higher levels (also called "Parent" levels) and lower levels (also called "Child" levels). <br>**Remark**: The root or the leaves correspond to specific nodes. |
| Root | First element of the TreeView control. The entire tree structure can be expanded from this element. |

## Modes for populating a TreeView control
<a name="modes_for_populating_treeview_control_ELTTEXTE000295"></a>
A TreeView control can be populated: 

- programmatically via different events and [TreeView control management functions](../WDLang1/3018025.md). 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) via data binding. For more details, see [TreeView control linked to a data file](../WDChamp/1013126.md).

- with data from a variable.

This feature can be very useful to manage the automatic backups. Furthermore, the example allows you to create multi-volume archives.
