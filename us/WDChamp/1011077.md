## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000191"></a>
The report editor gives you the ability to create "Composite" reports. In this case, the report includes several sub-reports. Each sub-report can display a different set of data and use a specific orientation. The different sub-reports are printed one after another.

For example:

- In the editor: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Etat_composite_Editeur.gif&type=thumb)


- At runtime: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=etatcomposite.gif&type=thumb)



**Remark** : The report editor proposes several methods for printing several reports in a single document:

- the internal reports, that are used to print several reports side by side. For more details, see [Internal Report control](../WDChamp/1013044.md).

- the sequencing of reports that can be performed through programming. This method can be easily implemented. For more details, see [Sequencing reports](../WDChamp/9000128.md). 

- the nested reports, that are used to create sequences of complex reports, with management of page footers. For more details, see [Nested reports](../WDChamp/1011001.md).

<a name="creating_composite_report_ELTTEXTE000215"></a>
To create a "Composite" report: 

1. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_nouveau.gif) in the quick access buttons. 

	- The creation window appears: click "Report" then "Report".  

	- The report creation wizard starts.   




2. Select the type of report: "Composite report". Go to the next step of the wizard via the arrow buttons. 

3. Specify in the wizard the number of sub-reports that will be included in the composite report. Go to the next step of the wizard. 

4. Give a name to your report and validate. 

5. The composite report appears in creation in the report editor. You must define the characteristics of each sub-report. 




**For each sub-report**: 
Click the link "&lt;Click here to define the sub-report&gt;". The wizard for defining the sub-report is displayed. You can:

- **Create a new sub-report**.

	1. Select: 

		- the type of sub-report to create (form, table, ...). For more details, see [Types of reports](../WDChamp/1011054.md).

		- the data source of the sub-report (data file, query, ...). For more details, see [Report data source](../WDChamp/1011055.md).

		- the elements of the sub-report (controls, sort conditions, breaks, ...).




2. Give a name to the sub-report and validate the creation of the sub-report.

- **Use an existing report**.

	1. Select the report to display in the sub-report.

	2. Give a name to the sub-report and validate the creation of the sub-report. By default, the sub-report is named: "S&lt;ReportName&gt;".

### Characteristics specific to the composite reports
<a name="characteristics_specific_the_composite_reports_ELTPARAGRAPHE000095"></a>

- The composite report includes several sub-reports. All the sub-reports are directly viewed in the report editor. 

- The composite report has a name, as well as each sub-report. The different sub-reports of the composite report are listed in the "Project explorer" pane. 

- Several methods can be used to view the description window of the composite report: 

	- On the "Modification" tab, click the ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_regroup.gif) dialog box launcher of the "Composite report" group. 

	- Select "Composite report description" in the context menu of the report. 




- The description window of the composite report is used to: 

	- Define the caption of the report and its name ("General" tab).

	- Define the export buttons available in the report viewer ("UI" tab).

	- Define the behavior if the sub-reports are empty ("UI" tab).

	- Make the report modifiable in Reports & Queries ("Details" tab).

	- Define the languages supported by the report ("Language" tab).

	- **Manage the sub-reports** ("Sub-reports" tab): you have the ability to add or delete sub-reports, to modify their print order, ...

<a name="characteristics_subreports_ELTPARAGRAPHE000121"></a>

- The sub-reports can be accessed in the editor by opening the composite report.  

- To view the description window of the sub-report: 

	1. Click in the sub-report. 

	2. On the "Modification" tab, click the ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_regroup.gif) dialog box launcher of the "Report" group. You also have the ability to select "Sub-report description" from the popup menu of the report.




- The description window of the sub-report is used to select the report to display.

- The report displayed by a sub-report can be modified through programming via [iChangeSubReportSource](../WDLang5/1000019621.md).
