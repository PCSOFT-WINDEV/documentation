## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000081"></a>
You can handle Gantt Chart columns in Table or TreeView Table controls using the following WLanguage properties.

Remark: These properties are identical to the ones used on a column found in a Table control or in a TreeView Table control.

You also have the ability to use the WLanguage properties on the Gantt charts found in a report.
