<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000188"></a>
In a Table control, you have the ability to customize the following elements:

- [the color of even rows and odd rows](#NOTE2_1).

- [the selection bar and the hover bar](#NOTE2_2).

- [the title of columns (images, sort icons, magnifier, filter, …)](../WDChamp/1013330.md)

- [the vertical and horizontal scrollbars](#NOTE2_3).

- [the outside and inside borders of table](#NOTE2_4).




**Remark**: Customizing these elements allows you to apply a "Vista" style to the computers that do not run Windows Vista. The skin templates supplied with WINDEV contain examples of reusable and modifiable images.
