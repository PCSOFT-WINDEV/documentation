## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000344"></a>
A break in a Looper control is used to group the data corresponding to one or more arguments.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=RuptureZR.GIF)
For example, you can list:

- the customers by country and by city, 

- the invoices per customer, 

- the products according to their family and sub-family, ...




The breaks in Looper controls are available for:

- Looper controls with in-memory data source.

- Memory Looper controls.




![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) The breaks are not available in Java.

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Remarks: 

- At runtime, the user has the ability to store the status of the current breaks in the Looper control (collapsed breaks, expanded breaks, ...). For more details, see [Storing the breaks in the Table/Looper controls (AAF)](../WDChamp/9500138.md). 

- You have the ability to manage the [breaks found in a Looper control through programming](#NOTE6_1).

## Add break
<a name="add_break_ELTTEXTE000368"></a>


### Add break
<a name="add_break_ELTPARAGRAPHE000072"></a>

To add a break into a Looper control:

1. Display the description window of the Looper control ("Description" from the popup menu).

2. In the "Content" tab, click <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=BtnRupture.GIF)
. The window for break management is displayed: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=FenRupture.GIF)


3. Select the item or the attribute on which a break must be performed. Several items and/or attributes can be selected in order to implement several breaks. 
	The suggested items and attributes depend on the type of Looper control:

	- ***In a Looper control linked to a data file***:

		- *automatic browse*: the search item, the attributes linked to this search item and the attributes linked to no item are proposed. If the search item corresponds to a composite key, the components of this composite key, the attributes linked to these components and the attributes linked to no item are proposed.

		- *programmed browse*: the items of the data file, the attributes linked to these items and the attributes linked to no item are proposed.




- ***In a Looper control linked to a query***:

	- *automatic browse*: the search item, the attributes linked to this search item and the attributes linked to no item are proposed. If the search item is not specified ("&lt;Automatic&gt;" option), the sorted query items, the attributes linked to these items and the attributes linked to no item are proposed.

	- *programmed browse*: the query items, the attributes linked to these items and the attributes linked to no item are proposed.

4. Validate the window for break management. 

5. The breaks will be performed according to the order in which they are displayed in the table of breaks found in the "Content" tab of the looper description. Modify (if necessary) this order via the arrow buttons found on the right of table.

6. Specifies the operating mode of breaks: 

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png)![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) whether breaks must be "Breaks with collapsed/expanded". If this option is checked, a "+ /-" button is automatically added into the break header. This button will allow the user to collapse or expand the break. 




7. Validate.




**Remarks**: 

- Breaks can be created in the single-column loopers and in the multicolumn loopers. 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) A break header can be always visible. In this case, during the scroll, the bar of the break will not be moved. In order for a break header to be always visible: 

	- Select the break header and display its description ("Description" in the context menu). 

	- In the "UI" tab, check "Break header always visible".

### Break header and footer
<a name="break_header_and_footer_ELTPARAGRAPHE000119"></a>

When adding a new break, a break header and a break footer are automatically added to the looper. If the looper includes several breaks, there will be as many break headers and break footers as the number of breaks.

The characteristics of these break headers and footers (name, visibility, background color, ...) can be modified in their description window ("Description" from the popup menu).

Each break header and break footer is associated with the "Display a row" event. This event is run when a new break header or break footer is displayed in the Looper control.

These break headers and footers can contain controls. These controls can be handled by programming.

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png)![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) The sums, averages and counts are automatic in the looper breaks. The controls found in the break headers and footers can display these calculations. For more details, see [automatic calculations in the looper breaks](#NOTE4_1).

To modify the image of break buttons: 

1. Display the description window of the Looper control ("Description" from the popup menu).

2. A break is defined in the "Content" tab. 

3. In the "Style" tab, select the "Break, border in creation" element.

4. Click the "Plus/Minus image of breaks" button. 

5. In the area that is displayed, enter the path of the image for the break button. This image is an image with 2 states (plus and minus) in 24 x 12 format. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Rupture_Perso_Btn.gif&type=thumb)

### Initializing the controls found in the break headers and footers
<a name="initializing_the_controls_found_the_break_headers_and_footers_ELTPARAGRAPHE000159"></a>

To initialize the controls found in the break headers and footers:

- handle each control found in all the break headers and footers: 
	
	```txt
	<Control name>.<Property name> = <Value>
		or
	<Looper name>.<Break header/footer name>.<Control name>.<Property name> = <Value>
	```
If &lt;Property name&gt; corresponds to [Value](../Proprietes/2510130.md), only the value of the control specified for the current row is modified

- handle each control found in a given break: 
	
	```txt
	<Looper name>[<Index>].<Control name>.<Property name> = <Value>
	```
&lt;Index&gt; must correspond to one of the rows in the specified break.

- handle each attribute found in all the break headers and footers:
	
	```txt
	<Attribute name> = <Value>
	```
The property associated with &lt;Attribute name&gt; will be initialized.

- handle each attribute of a given break: 
	
	```txt
	<Attribute name>[<Index>] = <Value>
	```
The property associated with &lt;Attribute name&gt; will be initialized.
	&lt;Index&gt; must correspond to one of the rows in the specified break.




**Remark**: These lines of code must be in the "Displaying a row of break header / footer" event.

### Retrieving the value of controls found in the break headers and footers
<a name="retrieving_the_value_controls_found_the_break_headers_and_footers_ELTPARAGRAPHE000190"></a>

To retrieve the value of controls found in the break headers and footers:

- handle each control found in the current break:
	
	```txt
	<Value> = <Control name>.<Property name>
		or
	<Value> = <Looper name>.<Break header/footer name>.<Control name>.<Property name>
	```


- handle each control found in a given break:
	
	```txt
	<Value> = <Looper name>[<Index>].<Control name>.<Property name>
	```
&lt;Index&gt; must correspond to one of the rows in the specified break.

- handle each attribute found in all the break headers and footers: 
	
	```txt
	<Value> = <Attribute name>
	```
The value of the property associated with &lt;Attribute name&gt; will be retrieved.

- handle each attribute of a given break:
	
	```txt
	<Value> = <Attribute name>[<Index>]
	```
The value of the property associated with &lt;Attribute name&gt; will be retrieved.
	&lt;Index&gt; must correspond to one of the rows in the specified break.




**Remark**: These lines of code must be in the "Displaying a row of break header / footer" event.

## Automatic calculations in the breaks of Looper controls
<a name="automatic_calculations_the_breaks_looper_controls_ELTTEXTE000434"></a>
You have the ability to perform automatic calculations (sum, count and average) in the break headers and footers.

To implement the automatic calculations:

1. Insert a Static control or an edit control into the break header and footer.

2. Open the control description window (select "Description" in the context menu).

3. In the "UI" tab, in the "In a break, display" area, click the "No calculation" link or click the calculation description (if an automatic calculation was already defined). The description window of an automatic calculation is displayed.

4. Select the calculation to perform. You can choose to:

	- "The sum of": the control will display the sum per break.

	- "The average of": the control will display the average on the break.

	- "The number (count) of": the control will count the number of elements per break.




5. Select the element on which the calculation must be performed. The calculation can be performed on:

	- A control: the calculation will be performed on the value property of control.

	- An attribute of the looper: the calculation will be performed by using the attribute property.

	- An item of the data file (for the browsing loopers).




6. Validate.




Tips: 

- Don't forget to modify the input mask of the control that displays the calculation according to the type of calculated information. 

- Don't hesitate to use the "eye magnet" technology on the edit controls that display calculations in the breaks. This gives you the ability you to highlight a calculation (displaying an insufficient turnover in red for example).

## Managing breaks in the Looper controls through programming
<a name="managing_breaks_the_looper_controls_through_programming_ELTTEXTE000559"></a>
The following functions are used to create and handle breaks in the Looper controls: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [BreakAdd](../WDLang1/1000022737.md) | Adds a break into a Table or Looper control. |
| [BreakDelete](../WDLang1/1000022738.md) | Deletes a break from a Table control or from a Looper control. |
| [BreakDeleteAll](../WDLang1/1000022739.md) | Deletes all breaks from a Table control or from a Looper control. |





To add a break in a Looper control, use [BreakAdd](../WDLang1/1000022737.md). The new break corresponds to a variable of type [Control](../WDLang1/1000020967.md) that can be handled with the same WLanguage properties as a break created in the editor.
