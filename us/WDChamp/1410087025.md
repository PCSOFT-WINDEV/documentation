<a name="managing_tab_stops_ELTPARAGRAPHE000543"></a>

When creating a blank document, no tab stop appears on the ruler. However, a default tab stop is defined every 1.25 centimeters. 

Different types of tabulations are available: 

- Left tab (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Champ_TT_Tabulation%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.gif)): the text is aligned to the right of tab stop. 

- Center tab (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Champ_TT_Tabulation%20-%20HC%20N%B0004.gif)): the text is centered during the input. 

- Right tab (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Champ_TT_Tabulation%20-%20HC%20N%B0005.gif)): the text is aligned to right and it extends to the left. 

- Decimal tab (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Champ_TT_Tabulation%20-%20HC%20N%B0006.gif)): the number are aligned to the left of decimal separator. 

- Tabulation bar: inserts a vertical bar at tab stop location. 

- First line indent (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Champ_TT_Tabulation%20-%20HC%20N%B0002%201.gif)): the first line indent is used to indent the text of first paragraph line. To perform a first line indent, all you have to do is move the rectangle symbolizing the first line. 

- Negative indent (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Champ_TT_Tabulation%20-%20HC%20N%B0002%201.gif)): the negative indent is used to indent the text of second paragraph line as well as the text of all following paragraph lines. To perform a negative indent, all you have to do is move the triangle symbolizing the paragraph lines.

When a document is opened in read-only mode, a "Read-only" bar is displayed instead of the arrows for Undo/Redo management. <br>![Read-only](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Champ_TT_Lecture_Seule%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)
In this case, only some operations can be performed in the document (search, etc.). The document cannot be modified.
