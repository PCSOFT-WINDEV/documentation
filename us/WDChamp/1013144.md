## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000297"></a>
You can handle Edit controls programmatically. To do so, use the variable that corresponds to the Edit control in the code.

This variable is the name of the control itself. The type of variable depends on the type of Edit control (numeric, text, currency, etc.).

## Displaying information in an Edit control
<a name="displaying_information_edit_control_ELTTEXTE000321"></a>
To display information in an Edit control, simply assign a value.

For example:

- direct assignment:
	
	```wl
	EDT_CustomerLastName = "Doe"
	```


- assignment using a variable:
	
	```wl
	EDT_LASTNAME = Customer_LastName
	```


- assignment by calculation:
	
	```wl
	EDT_LASTNAME = NoSpace(CUSTOMER.LASTNAME) + TAB + NoSpace(CUSTOMER.FIRSTNAME)
	```



**Remark**: If the control is associated with a data file item, the assignment is automatically performed via: 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) the [FileToScreen](../WDLang4/3044210.md) function.


You can also use the following notation: CustomerLastName = CUSTOMER.LASTNAME. For more details, see [Binding an Edit control to an item](../WDChamp/1013159.md).

## Retrieving the value entered in an Edit control
<a name="retrieving_the_value_entered_edit_control_ELTTEXTE000345"></a>
To retrieve the content of an Edit control:

- perform a simple assignment. 
	For example:
	
	```wl
	CurrentEditContent = EDT_EDIT1
	```


- retrieve part of the information. 
	For example:
	
	```wl
	Initial = Left(EDT_LastName, 1) 
	Initial = EDT_LastName[[1]]
	```


- use the [Value](../Proprietes/2510130.md) property




**Remark**: If the control is bound to a data file item, the value entered in the control is automatically updated in the data source using: 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) the [ScreenToFile](../WDLang4/3044146.md) function.


You can also use the following notation: CUSTOMER.LASTNAME = Edit1. For more details, see [Binding an Edit control to an item](../WDChamp/1013159.md).
