## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000179"></a>
The data that will be displayed in the Chart control can come from:

- an item of a data file or a query.

- a column of a Table control found in the current window or page.
	

- a List Box control found in the current window or page.
	

- a WLanguage array.
	

- data specified in the description window of the control or through programming.

- a control of the current report (only for a report).




The mode for filling the chart is specified in the wizard for control creation and in the control description window (["Series" tab](../WDChamp/3042081.md)).

## Chart populated programmatically
<a name="chart_populated_programmatically_ELTTEXTE000203"></a>
The programming required to fill the chart is performed by the following functions: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [grAddData](../WDLang3/3042023.md) | Adds a data into a chart. |
| [grHMAddData](../WDLang3/1000021628.md) | Adds a data into a Heatmap chart. |
| [grIncreaseData](../WDLang3/3042030.md) | Adds a value to a data in a chart. |
| [grScatterAddDataXY](../WDLang3/3042032.md) | Adds a data into a "Scatter" chart. |
| [grStockAddData](../WDLang3/3042009.md) | Adds data into a stock chart (candlestick, barcharts or minmax). |
| [grSunburstAddData](../WDLang3/1000021285.md) | Adds a data to a Sunburst chart. |
| [grSurfaceAddData](../WDLang3/1000020425.md) | Adds a data into a Surface chart. |





For example:

- **Chart control in a window or page**:
	The "CHART_MySalary" Chart control is used to view the evolution of a salary over the last four years in a Line chart.
	The "EDT_Salary1", "EDT_Salary2", "EDT_Salary3" and "EDT_Salary4" edit controls are used to type the salary for the corresponding year.
	In this example, write the following code in the "Initializing" event of the Chart control:
	
	```wl
	// Add data into the chart
	grAddData(CHART_MySalary, 1, EDT_Salary1)
	grAddData(CHART_MySalary, 1, EDT_Salary2)
	grAddData(CHART_MySalary, 1, EDT_Salary3)
	grAddData(CHART_MySalary, 1, EDT_Salary4)
	```


- **Chart control in a report**: 
	The "RPT_MyReport" report prints the details (last name, first name, turnover) of the 10 best customers.
	The "CHART_MyChart" chart displays the turnover of each customer in a pie chart.
	In this example, write the following code in the "Before printing" event of the Body block:
	
	```wl
	// Add data into the chart
	grAddData(CHART_MyChart, 1, MySource.Turnover)
	```

### Remarks
<a name="remarks_ELTPARAGRAPHE000085"></a>

- If the fill mode is automatic, we advise you not to program the chart filling (with [grAddData](../WDLang3/3042023.md), [grScatterAddDataXY](../WDLang3/3042032.md), [grStockAddData](../WDLang3/3042009.md) and [grIncreaseData](../WDLang3/3042030.md)).

- The chart is automatically created by the window editor, page editor or report editor. There is no need to use [grCreate](../WDLang3/3042005.md) to create it.

- The aspect of the chart and/or the display of text in the chart can be modified:

	- in the chart description ("Description" in the context menu of control). For more details, see [The Chart control: Characteristics in the editor](../WDChamp/3042076.md).

	- via the [functions for chart management](../WDLang3/3042003.md).

### Chart control in a window or in a page based on a Table control built by BuildBrowsingTable
<a name="chart_control_window_page_based_table_control_built_buildbrowsingtable_ELTPARAGRAPHE000122"></a>

If you are creating a new chart whose source is a Table control filled by [BuildBrowsingTable](../WDLang1/3074002.md) from a query, you must specify that the columns correspond to _COL1, _COL2, ...

You can also use [grSourceSeries](../WDLang3/3042067.md) to modify the source of the series.
