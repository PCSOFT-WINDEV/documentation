## Tooltip on the chart values
<a name="tooltip_the_chart_values_ELTTEXTE000201"></a>
 
By default, in a chart, a tooltip is displayed when a data is hovered by the mouse cursor. This tooltip contains the value and the caption of series and category. This tooltip can be customized by [grTooltip](../WDLang3/3042010.md). 

The characteristics of this tooltip are as follows: 

- Immediate display for better visibility, 

- Tooltip border that use the color of the series. The association between the tooltip and the series is immediate. 

- Semi-transparent tooltip: the chart below is visible.

- Arrow precisely pointing to the targeted point.

<a name="the_different_options_the_context_menu_ELTTEXTE000225"></a>
A chart is associated with a context menu by default (displayed via a right mouse click).<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Graphe_MenuCtx.gif)


This context menu allows end users to perform several operations.  

The context menu of a chart is used to:

- configure the type of the chart: pie, line, column, stock chart, ... This allows you to choose the best view mode according to the displayed data. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=graphe_Courbe.gif&type=thumb)

	<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=graphe_Aire.gif&type=thumb)


- display (or not) the legend and configure its position.

- display (or not) the gridlines.

- configure the position of the different axes. For example: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Graphe_axes2.gif&type=thumb)
