When an image is opened in read-only mode, a "Read-only" bar is displayed instead of the arrows for Undo/Redo management. In this case, only some operations can be performed. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Champ_Editeur_img_LSeule%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)

- Delete the selected layer (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Editeur_img_calque%20-%20HC%20N%B0002%203.gif)),

Each layer includes a context menu allowing you to handle it (duplicate, merge, move, ...).

The option "Visible/Invisible through programming" allows you to make the layer usable through programming: This allows you to display the image in an Image control while specifying the layer to be made visible or invisible.
