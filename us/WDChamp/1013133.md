## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000123"></a>
WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile give you the ability to use clickable images. A clickable image is an image (displayed in an Image control) that can be clicked by the user. A specific process (click code of the image) is run.

Unlike a button, no pressed effect is seen when a clickable image is clicked.

## Using a clickable image
<a name="using_clickable_image_ELTTEXTE000147"></a>
To use a clickable image in an application:

1. On the "Creation" tab, in the "Usual controls" group, click "Image".

2. Open the control description ("Description" in the context menu of the image).

3. In the "Details" tab, use the click settings: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=FAA_MenuContextuelImage%20-%20HC%20N%B0001%201.gif)


	- The "This image is a clickable area" option makes the image clickable. The "Click" event is automatically added to the WLanguage events associated with the control.

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png) "Priority for clicks" allows to intercept the click on the image, regardless of the Z-order of the Image control in the window. If this option is not checked, the Image control must be displayed in the foreground to intercept the mouse click.

- Specify whether the image will be handled by the user. For more details, see [Context menu of Image controls](../WDChamp/9500105.md).

In this case, you may have to use a shared memory zone. This memory zone will allow all the started applications to share some information.
