## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000144"></a>
The Funnel chart displays data in funnel format. Once totalized, this data is equal to 100%. This type of chart is a chart with a single series. It represents the data as parts of 100%. This type of chart uses no axis.

The Funnel charts are often used to represent the steps in a sales process and to indicate the amount of potential revenues expected for each step. 

The Funnel chart is especially well suited for illustrating the business opportunities. The opportunities most likely to be signed are found at the bottom of the funnel while the less promising opportunities are found at the top. 

This is a very useful solution for assisting the business people in their decisions.
