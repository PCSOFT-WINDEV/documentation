## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000161"></a>
WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile allow you to handle Rating controls programmatically. To do so, use the variable of the Rating control in the code.

The variable of the Rating control:

- corresponds to the name of the Rating control.

- is initialized with the rating displayed by the Rating control.






<a name="NOTE2"></a>
<a name="NOTE2_1"></a>


## Retrieving the rating displayed in the control
<a name="retrieving_the_rating_displayed_the_control_ELTTEXTE000185"></a>
To retrieve the rating, use the following syntax:


```txt
<Rating> = <Rating control>
```


&lt;Rating&gt; is an integer or real variable, according to the granularity defined for the ratings in the description window of the control. 

**Remarks**: 

- You can also use the [Value](../Proprietes/2510130.md) property. 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) The &lt;Rating&gt; takes into account the specified value per star (in the control description or with the [ValuePerStar](../Proprietes/1000021996.md) property). 




<a name="NOTE3"></a>
<a name="NOTE3_1"></a>


## Modifying the rating displayed in the control
<a name="modifying_the_rating_displayed_the_control_ELTTEXTE000209"></a>
To modify the rating, use the following syntax:


```txt
<Rating control> = <Rating>
```


&lt;Rating&gt; is a value between the minimum and maximum rating of the Rating control. These values have been defined in the control description window or in the code with the [MinValue](../Proprietes/2510008.md) and [MaxValue](../Proprietes/2510009.md) properties.

**Remarks**: 

- You can also use the [Value](../Proprietes/2510130.md) property.

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Caution: if a value per star is specified (in the control description or with the [ValuePerStar](../Proprietes/1000021996.md) property), the &lt;Rating&gt; must take this value into account (value of a star multiplied by the number of stars displayed). 




<a name="NOTE4"></a>
<a name="NOTE4_1"></a>

| [MinValue](../Proprietes/2510008.md) | Used to find out and modify the minimum value of a Rating control. This property is particularly useful for Rating controls with a "Like/Dislike" feature.<br><br><br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Notation_Jaime.gif)<br> |
