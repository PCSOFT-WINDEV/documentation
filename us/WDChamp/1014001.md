### Creating a control in a window
<a name="creating_control_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000047"></a>

To create a control in a window:

1. Go to the "Creation" tab in the window editor. This tab contains all the types of controls that can be created in a window. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Fen_Creation_champ.gif&type=thumb)
According to the type of control to create: 

	- click its icon. 

	- if an arrow is displayed beside the control name, expand the list and select the type of control to create.




2. Click at the desired location to create the control.




**Remark**: To create a new column in a Table control from the window editor:

1. Select the Table control.

2. Right-click to open the context menu: 

	- select "Add a column". 

	- select the type of column to create.






<a name="NOTE2_2"></a>


### Creating a control from a dictionary control
<a name="creating_control_from_dictionary_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000070"></a>

WINDEV allows you to create a control from a control found in a dictionary (".DIC" file). A dictionary allows you to store elements (controls, windows, ...) for a future use in the new projects. For more details, see [Dictionary](../Editeurs/2023002.md).

To create a control from a control found in a dictionary:

1. Display the ["Dictionary" pane](../Editeurs/2027014.md).

2. Open the dictionary if necessary ("Open" in the context menu).

3. Select the initial control found in the dictionary (in the "Window controls" category).

4. Perform a Drag and Drop of the control found in the dictionary toward its future position in the window.

5. Subscribe the created control to the dictionary if necessary. If the created control subscribes to the dictionary, the modifications made to the control found in the dictionary will be automatically applied to the created control. For more details, see [Subscribing an element to the dictionary](../Editeurs/2023001.md).



<a name="NOTE2_3"></a>


### Creating a control from the clipboard content
<a name="creating_control_from_the_clipboard_content_ELTPARAGRAPHE000094"></a>

The window editor is used to create several types of control according to the clipboard content:

| Clipboard content | Type of created control |
| --- | --- |
| Text, copied from a text editor for example. | Static control |
| Image file copied from Windows explorer. | Image control |
| Image, copied from an HTML page for example. | Image control |
| File description, copied from the data model editor or from the ["Analysis" pane](../Editeurs/2027012.md). | Table based on a data file |
| File item, copied from the ["Analysis" pane](../Editeurs/2027012.md). | Control created by RAD according to the type of control specified in the "RAD" tab of item description. |



**To create a control from the clipboard content**: 

1. Copy the element to the clipboard: on the "Home" tab, in the "Editing" group, click "Copy" (o Ctrl + C).

2. In the window editor, on the "Home" tab, in the "Editing" group, click "Paste" (or Ctrl + V).




**Remark**: You can explicitly choose the format in which the clipboard content must be pasted in the window editor: on the "Home" tab, in the "Editing" group, expand "Paste" and select "Special paste". For more details, see [Special paste](../Editeurs/2026001.md).

<a name="NOTE6_3"></a>


### Locking controls
<a name="locking_controls_ELTPARAGRAPHE000464"></a>

In some cases, you may want to lock the controls in a fixed position: in this case, the control cannot position be modified and the control is not selected during a selection performed with the lasso. This feature is often useful for the layout controls.

To lock a control: 

1. Select the control.

2. Use one of the following methods:

	- on the "Modification" tab, in the "Help for edit" group, check "Locked".

	- press Alt + V.






<a name="NOTE6_4"></a>


### Aligning the window controls
<a name="aligning_the_window_controls_ELTPARAGRAPHE000491"></a>

To properly align the controls in the window, use the following features:

- [Alignment options](../Editeurs/2022004.md)

- [Real-time interface checker (automatic positioning)](../Editeurs/2022003.md)

- [Advanced interface checker](../Editeurs/2022005.md)

- [Rulers and markers](../Editeurs/2022001.md)

- [Snap-on grid](../Editeurs/2022002.md)

- [Zoom](../Editeurs/2021007.md)



<a name="NOTE6_5"></a>


### Resizing window controls
<a name="resizing_window_controls_ELTPARAGRAPHE000511"></a>

To resize a control in a window, you have the ability to use: 

- the mouse (via the sizing handles of the control) 
	Remark: In this case, the resizing of the control and content is WYSIWYG. 

- the following keyboard shortcuts on the selected control: 

	- Alt right arrow: Enlarge the control from the right. 

	- Alt left arrow: Enlarge the control from the left.

	- Alt up arrow: Enlarge the control from the top.  

	- Alt down arrow: Enlarge the control from the bottom. 






<a name="NOTE6_6"></a>


### Use a control outside the window
<a name="use_control_outside_the_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000532"></a>

In most cases, the controls belong to a window. Therefore, these controls appear in edit and at runtime. However, a control can be positioned in the host window of the window: the control is said to be "off window". This control will be visible in edit mode and invisible at runtime. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=FenFenAccueil.gif)
An "off-window" control is used to:

- Keep a control in a window without displaying it at runtime. This allows you to use the content of the control programmatically (like a variable).

- Display new controls in a window when resizing it.



<a name="NOTE6_7"></a>


### Resizing the window
<a name="resizing_the_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000544"></a>

When the window is resized (by the user or through programming), the controls found in the enlarging area of the window are automatically displayed.
For example:

- In the editor, the "login" window is as follows: <br>![The Details button is used to enlarge the window height.](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ChpHorsFen1.gif)


- At runtime, once the "Details" button was clicked, the "login" window is as follows: <br>![The off-window controls are automatically displayed.](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ChpHorsFen2.gif)





To prevent the "off-window" controls from being displayed when the window is resized, these controls must be located above the window (top part of the splash screen).
<a name="NOTE6_8"></a>


### Creating an "off-window" control
<a name="creating_offwindow_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000562"></a>

To create an "off-window" control:

1. Go to the "Creation" tab in the window editor. This tab contains all the types of controls that can be created in a window. Depending on the type of control to create: 

	- click its icon. 

	- if an arrow is displayed beside the control name, expand the list and select the type of control to create.




2. In the home window, click the location where the control must be created.
