All types of controls available in the report editor can be added into a table. These controls can:

2. Select "Add to table" in the context menu of control. A wizard starts.

3. Select "Add to an existing column".

4. Select the column where the addition will be performed as well as the control position in the column (header, data or total).

5. Validate the cell addition.



<a name="NOTE3_2"></a>


### Adding a column
<a name="adding_column_ELTPARAGRAPHE000096"></a>

You have the ability to add a column to a table. This new column may (or may not) correspond to an existing control.

To add an existing control into a table as column:

1. Select the control.

2. You can:

	- Drag and Drop the control to the table. After confirmation, a new column is created after the existing columns. The description of the cells found in this new column corresponds to the initial control.

	- select "Add to table" in the context menu of control. A wizard allows you to specify the characteristics of this new column.







To insert a new column:

1. You can:

	- select "Insert a column" from the popup menu of the table.

## Resizing a table cell
<a name="resizing_table_cell_ELTTEXTE000396"></a>
The entire table is resized when a table cell is resized in the report editor.

Two cases may occur:

- **Modifying the width of a cell**:
	All the cells found in the column will also be resized. 
	All the columns found after the column currently resized will be moved.

To resize a cell:

1. Select the corresponding cell in the editor. Black handles appear around the cell.

2. Hover the black handle corresponding to the side to resize. When the mouse cursor turns into a double arrow, keep the left mouse button down and resize the cell.

3. Release the left mouse button. The resizing is performed.




**Remark: Border of the block and border of the cell**
A cell can be stuck to a report block. In this case, when the cell is resized, the block will be automatically resized or not according to the cursor displayed.
The mouse cursor differs according to the element to resize:

- a small double black arrow indicates that the cell is currently resized.

- a large double blue arrow indicates that the block and the cell are currently resized.

## Moving a table column
<a name="moving_table_column_ELTTEXTE000420"></a>
Moving the table columns consists in modifying the order in which the columns are displayed in the table.

Several methods can be used to move the table columns:

- in the report currently modified: select a column cell and use the keyboard arrows (or select "Move to..." from the popup menu of the cell).

- from the table description window: the arrow buttons are used to move the selected column.

- "Drag and Drop" a column cell in the editor.

## Removing or deleting a column from a table
<a name="removing_deleting_column_from_table_ELTTEXTE000444"></a>
A column found in a table can be:

- ***removed from the table***: the column cells are no longer associated with the table. These cells remain in the report and they can be handled independently of the table.

- ***deleted***: the cells are no longer present in the table nor in the report.
