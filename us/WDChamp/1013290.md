## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000314"></a>
WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile allow you to use:

- Table controls populated programmatically. 

- Table controls based on a data file with direct access (called Table control based on a data file). 

- Table controls based on a data file loaded in memory. In this case, only a limited number of records is loaded in memory. If the data file contains more records than the number defined in the description of the Table control, a message is displayed to the user: "There are more than XXX records. Only the first XXX rows will be displayed".




The table below presents the different features available (or not) for the different types of Table controls.

Remark: The concept of control based on a "file loaded in memory" can also be applied to:

- List Box controls, 

- ListView controls, 

- Combo Box controls.

(\*) For Table controls based on a data file with direct access, if the cascading input was disabled, you can call [TableAddLine](../WDLang1/3074006.md) to add a row to the control and allow users to enter data. In this case, [TableAddLine](../WDLang1/3074006.md) can be called once only.

Table controls with in-memory data source are similar to standard Table controls. The main differences between these two types of controls are shown in bold.

Table controls with in-memory data source have multiple advantages, especially the ability to sort and search on any column. They are also used to store the value of calculated columns for all the rows.
