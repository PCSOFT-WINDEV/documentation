## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000139"></a>
The **Keyboard** variable makes it possible to retrieve the parameters of the events of a physical keyboard. Indeed, an Android device can have a physical keyboard, or can be connected to a physical keyboard (through the Samsung DeX system for example). 

This variable must be used only in events related to the physical keyboard: 

- Key down (WM_KEYDOWN), 

- Key up (WM_KEYUP).


On Android, these two events are called only if they are triggered by a keyboard event coming from a physical keyboard. 
On Chrome OS, these two events are not called. 



Remark: This variable can be used in Simulator mode.

## Keyboard Variable

The Keyboard variable includes the following elements:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| Keyboard.Alt | Boolean<br><br>Indicates whether the Alt key is pressed when the keyboard event is triggered. |
| Keyboard.Code | Integer<br><br>Indicates the code corresponding to the key that triggered the keyboard event. |
| Keyboard.Ctrl | Boolean<br><br>Indicates whether the Ctrl key is pressed when the keyboard event is triggered. |
| Keyboard.Shift | Boolean<br><br>Indicates whether the Shift key is pressed when the keyboard event is triggered. |






### Manage the code of the keys
<a name="manage_the_code_the_keys_ELTPARAGRAPHE000058"></a>

To manage the code of the keys: 

1. Include the KeyConst.WL file in your project. This file associates a specific constant with each keyboard key. This file can be found in the directory WINDEV/WEBDEV/WINDEV Mobile (subdirectory "Personal\\External"). To include this file in your applications, you need to use the [EXTERN](../Motscles/1511013.md) keyword as follows : 
	
	```wl
	EXTERN "KEYCONST.wl"
	```


2. Then use the desired constants with the variable Keyboard.code: 
	
	```wl
	IF Keyboard.Code = VK_Space THEN 
	...
	END
	```



Remarks: 

- To manage character keys, simply use the ASCII code of that character (returned by [Asc](../WDLang1/3024004.md)).

- All the constants found in the KeyConst.WL file start with the letters VK_. These constants are displayed by the code completion in the code editor from the moment the file has been integrated with the [EXTERN](../Motscles/1511013.md) keyword.

### Perform an action in the Key down event

The following code is used to perform an action in the "Key down" event of an edit control when using Ctrl + V. 


```wl
IF Keyboard.Code = VK_V _AND_ Keyboard.Ctrl THEN 
	Info ("Ctrl V used")
	...
END
```
