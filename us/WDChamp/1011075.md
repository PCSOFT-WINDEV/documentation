## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000280"></a>
For legal reasons, it may be useful to keep an identical copy of a report (an invoice for example). 

Furthermore, due to the large amount of data to process (statistical reports for example), some reports may take quite a long time to generate. 

The Duplicate feature automatically proposes a solution to fix this problem. 

**The principle is straightforward**: When editing a report (report created in the report editor or through programming), its identical copy can be generated and stored in a file in ".dpl" format. 
This allows you to re-edit a duplicate copy of the report. The data is not processed again so it is protected against the modifications and this re-edit operation is performed immediately. 

The creation of a duplicate copy can be performed: 

- from the report viewer (WINDEV only).

- programmatically. 


You can sign a duplicate copy using a certificate: 

- from the report viewer. 

- through programming.


**Remarks**: 

- Printing a report with duplicate copies slows the print down. Indeed, the duration for creating the duplicate copy is included in the print duration. We advise you to run performance tests. 

- Printing a page of a report with duplicate copy triggers the creation of the duplicate copy for the entire report.

## Creating a duplicate from the report viewer

### Print available by default
<a name="print_available_default_ELTPARAGRAPHE000045"></a>

By default, the "Export" pane of the report viewer offers the "Duplicate" option to create a duplicate of the report being displayed. 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Apercu_Volet_Exporter.gif)


When this option is selected, a file picker allows the user to: 

- enter the name of the duplicate file that will be created. 

- specify the certificate that will be used to sign the duplicate. The signature of the duplicate is optional.




By default, the duplicate: 

- is saved in the directory of the application. 

- has no password. 

- is named: Dupli_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.dpl.




**Remarks**: 

- To disable the option to create duplicates, use [iParameterViewer](../WDLang5/1000024634.md) (*iButtonDuplicate* constant). 

- To modify the default parameters of the duplicate copy, use [iParameterDuplicate](../WDLang5/1000018845.md) before opening the report viewer.

### Customizing the created duplicate copy
<a name="customizing_the_created_duplicate_copy_ELTPARAGRAPHE000079"></a>

To modify the default parameters for the duplicates created from the report viewer, you can use [iParameterDuplicate](../WDLang5/1000018845.md) with the *iDplPrintout* constant. 

Example: 


```wl
// Configure the duplicate copy of invoice
iParameterDuplicate(iDplPrintout, "C:\Temp", ...
	"MyDuplicate_%d_%t", "DDDD DD MMMM YYYY", "HH.MM.SS")

// Print the duplicate
iDestination(iViewer)
iPrintReport(RPT_Invoice)
```

[iParameterDuplicate](../WDLang5/1000018845.md) is used to: 

- customize the duplicate options proposed by default by the "Duplicate" option found in the report viewer. 

- automate the print of a duplicate from the report viewer. Indeed: 

	- the duplicate will be generated when printing (from the report viewer). 

	- if an annotation or an edit control is modified in the report viewer, a new duplicate copy will be generated during the next printout.

	- if the print is performed on several printers, a duplicate copy will be generated for each printer. 







**Remark**: The list of duplicate copies created during the last print is returned by [iLastFile](../WDLang5/3046068.md).

### Customizing the report viewer
<a name="customizing_the_report_viewer_ELTPARAGRAPHE000111"></a>

If you have customized the report viewer with a version that does not support this option, to manage duplicates, simply: 

1. Import the new report viewer window. 

2. Copy the button for creating the duplicate. 




For more details, see [Customizing the report viewer](../WDChamp/2024002.md).

## Creating a duplicate copy through programming
<a name="creating_duplicate_copy_through_programming_ELTTEXTE000340"></a>
<a name="NOTE3_1"></a>
To create a duplicate copy through programming:

1. Use [iParameterDuplicate](../WDLang5/1000018845.md) (associated with the *iDplPrintout* constant) to configure the options for creating the duplicate copies. 

2. Use [iDestination](../WDLang5/3046074.md) and specify that the print must be performed on a printer. The duplicate copy will be created while the print is performed. 




To stop printing the duplicate copies, use [iParameterDuplicate](../WDLang5/1000018845.md) (associated with the *iDplNone* constant).

## Signing a duplicate copy
<a name="signing_duplicate_copy_ELTTEXTE000364"></a>
<a name="NOTE4_1"></a>
The duplicate copies can be signed via a certificate. This signature ensures the integrity of the reports stored. The signature is included in the duplicate. 

This signature automatically perform a timestamp. If may be required legally for some uses. 

The signature standard used is PKCS7. 

You can sign a duplicate copy using a certificate: 

- from the report viewer (see [Creating a duplicate from the report viewer](#NOTE2_1) on this page). 

- programmatically: 

	- The signature of duplicate copies is performed by the functions: 
			


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [iDestination](../WDLang5/3046074.md) | Configures the print destination. |
| [iParameterDuplicate](../WDLang5/1000018845.md) | Configures the automatic creation of the duplicate copy generated during the next print. |

- The signature of a duplicate file is checked by the function: 
			




**Remark**: If the report includes a Signature control (linked to a certificate) or if [iPrintSignature](../WDLang5/1000021690.md) is used, the duplicate will be automatically signed during its creation.

## Using a duplicate copy
<a name="using_duplicate_copy_ELTTEXTE000407"></a>
<a name="NOTE5_1"></a>
To use an existing duplicate copy, you can: 

- drop the ".dpl" file into the editor of WINDEV or WEBDEV: the duplicate copy is automatically opened in the report viewer and it can be printed. 

- use the [iPrintDuplicate](../WDLang5/1000018842.md) function. This function is used to print the specified ".dpl" file. To display the duplicate copy in the report viewer, all you have to do is use [iDestination](../WDLang5/3046074.md). For example: 
	
	```wl
	iDestination(iViewer)
	iPrintDuplicate("C:\My Projects\My_Project\Exe\Dupli_20101021_112712.dpl")
	```



![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) **Viewer of duplicate copies**
Installed with the application on the end-user computer, this viewer is used to easily view and print the content of a duplicate file. To do so, double-click the ".dpl" file.  
To install this tool, select the optional "DplViewer" tool in the wizard for generating the setup program.

### Colored bars
<a name="colored_bars_ELTPARAGRAPHE000222"></a>

When a duplicate is displayed in the report viewer, several bars may appear at the bottom of the viewer to inform the user of the duplicate file used: ![centeralt=Colored bars](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Duplicata_couleurs.gif)
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) **Viewer of duplicate copies**
These color bars are also available in the viewer of duplicate copies.
