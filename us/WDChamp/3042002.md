## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000181"></a>
In the line charts, the data is interpreted as successive Y-coordinates of points. Then, the dots found in each series are linked by a line.

The line charts are mainly used to represent the data trend.

In this chart:

**1. Chart title**. 
The characteristics of the chart title can be defined in the "Details" tab of the control description ("Edit chart title").
You can define the chart title, its position and style.

**2. Title of axes**. 
The title of horizontal and vertical axes is displayed if the title was defined in the "General" tab of the Chart control description. This parameter can also be defined through programming with [grAxisTitle](../WDLang3/3042057.md).

**3. Mark on the vertical axis**. 
The mark is automatically calculated by default. The "General" tab of the control description is used to define:

- a specific graduation.

- a scale of X-coordinates according to the time. This option operates with Date or DateTime data coming from a Table control or from an HFSQL item. This option cannot be used with a series filled through programming. 

- a logarithmic scale of Y coordinates.




You also have the ability to use the secondary scale for one or more series ("Series" tab).

**4. Legend**. 
The characteristics of the legend can be defined in the "Details" tab of the control description ("Edit chart legend").
You can define its position and its style.

**5. Labels of series**. 
The caption of the legend corresponds to the caption of the different series displayed in the chart (defined in the "Series" tab).

**6. Color of series**. 
A color can be defined for each series in the "Series" tab of the control description. An automatic color is used by default.

**7. Category label**. 
The category labels can be defined in the "Series" tab of the control description.

**8. Gridlines**. 
The horizontal and vertical gridlines can be defined in the "General" tab of the control description.

You also have the ability to **display the values of the data**. This parameter is displayed if the two following conditions are fulfilled:

- if the point of the series is drawn ("Type of point" in the "Series" tab of the control description window).  

- if "Show values" is checked in the "Details" tab of the Chart control description.


A **background image** can also be selected for the Chart control in the "Details" tab of the description window.
