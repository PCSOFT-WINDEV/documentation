## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000146"></a>
The Cube control is a control that automatically performs rotations around the different axes. This control can be found in a corner of a window for example.

**Caution**: This control requires the .Net framework 3.0 (or later) to operate. This framework is included in Vista (and later) and it can be downloaded for Windows XP (from the Microsoft site). The first use of a control that requires this framework (Carousel control, Cube control or Xaml control) loads this framework, which may cause delay (out of our control).

**To create a "Cube" control**: 

1. On the "Creation" tab, in the "Other controls" group, click "Cube".

2. Click at the desired location to create the control. The control appears in the editor.




To display the control characteristics, select "Description" from the popup menu of control.

The Cube control must be associated with an image. This image will be automatically animated by the Cube control. This image can be selected in the "General" tab of the control description.

## Handling the Cube control programmatically
<a name="handling_the_cube_control_programmatically_ELTTEXTE000170"></a>
WINDEV allows you to handle a Cube control programmatically. To do so, use the variable of the Cube control in the code. This variable is of type numeric.

The variable of the Cube control corresponds to the name of the Cube control.

**Cube control functions**
The following functions can be used to handle Cube controls:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [XamlDisable](../WDLang1/1000015004.md) | Simulates the absence of .Net 3.0 framework. |




**Cube control properties**
The following properties can be used to to handle Cube controls:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [AnimationPeriod](../Proprietes/2510152.md) | The **AnimationPeriod** property is used to get and modify rotation speed of the animation in the Cube or Carousel controls. |




For a complete list of WLanguage properties that can be used with Cube controls, see [Cube control properties](../WDChamp/1016101.md).

### Limitations
<a name="limitations_ELTPARAGRAPHE000070"></a>

The limitations of the Cube control are as follows:

- The .Net framework version 3.0 (or later) must be installed on the computer. This framework is included in Vista and it can be downloaded for Windows XP (from the Microsoft site). 
	The first use of a control that requires this framework (Carousel, Cube or Xaml) loads this framework, which may cause delay (out of our control).

- The application cannot be started from the network.

- The DDW feature (Dim Disabled Windows) is disabled for all the windows containing a Cube control.

- This control does not operate under TSE.

- This control uses the wd280xaml.dll library. This library cannot be renamed when creating the executable.

### Simulating the absence of .Net 3.0 framework
<a name="simulating_the_absence_net_30_framework_ELTPARAGRAPHE000087"></a>

When developing an application that contains a Cube control, it may be useful to find out how the application will operate when it is started on a computer not equipped with the .Net 3.0 framework (or later).

To simulate the absence of the framework on a computer:

- use the [XamlDisable](../WDLang1/1000015004.md) function.

- rename the following registry key:
	 "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\.NETFramework\\v3.0".
