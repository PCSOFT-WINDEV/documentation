<a name="events_supported_windev_and_windev_mobile_ELTPARAGRAPHE000013"></a>

WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile manage the following events by default (order of appearance in the code editor):

| Event | Runtime condition |
| --- | --- |
| Initialization | Executed when the window is opened. (\*) |
| Click | Run when a click is performed on the Image control (for a [clickable image](../WDChamp/1013133.md)) |
|   | Optional event during multi-touch.<br><br>Executed when quickly moving one or more fingers on the screen. For more details on this event, see [Multi-touch in an Image control](../WDChamp/9500131.md). |
|   | Optional event during multi-touch. <br><br>Executed when moving one or more fingers horizontally or vertically while keeping them in contact with the screen. For more details on this event, see [Multi-touch in an Image control](../WDChamp/9500131.md). |
|   | Optional event during multi-touch.<br><br>Executed when spreading or pinching two fingers on the screen. For more details on this event, see [Multi-touch in an Image control](../WDChamp/9500131.md). |


(\*) By default, the "Initializing" event of each control is executed according to the order in which the controls were created in the window. To modify this order of execution: 

1. On the "Window" tab, in the "Order" group, click "Initialization". 

2. In the window that appears, use the arrows on the right to change the order in which the controls are initialized.

Several optional events can be managed.

To add an optional event:

1. Select the desired control.

2. Display the code window of this control (F2 key).

3. Click the link "Add other events to xxx" at the bottom of the window code, after the last event.  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Traitements_optionnels_WD_OK%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)


4. All the optional events available for the control are displayed. 

5. Check the optional event to add and validate. 
	Remark: You can select several optional events. 

6. The selected optional event is automatically added to the events managed by the control.




To disable an optional event, simply perform the same operations to display the list of optional events. Then simply uncheck the optional events to delete. 
Remark: If the disabled code contains WLanguage code, this code is automatically deleted.

You can manage, for example:

- the mouse hover over the control,

- left mouse button down, up, double click,

- right mouse button down, up, double click, 

- mouse wheel, etc.
