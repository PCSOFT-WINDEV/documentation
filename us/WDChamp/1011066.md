## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000294"></a>
A report based on an SQL query with data accessed via a connection can print records from a database accessible via a specific ODBC driver or via a Native Connector. This query is defined when creating the report.

**Characteristics of a report based on an SQL query via a connection:**

- the ***connection parameters*** (name of the connection, name of the user, ...). These parameters allows you to access the records that will be printed in the report.
	For an ODBC connection, the parameters are defined in the ODBC administrator (in the control panel of Windows).
	For a connection via the Native Connector, the parameters are defined when configuring the database.

- the ***SQL code of the query*** associated with the report. This code must correspond to a Select query ("SELECT"). This query is used to specify the items that will be printed in the report.




**Caution**: The SQL code must be recognized by the database accessed.

The creation of a report based on an SQL query via a connection is performed by the wizard for report creation. 

Once the report based on an SQL query is created, you can:

- modify the SQL code of query ("Data" tab in the report description).

- modify the parameters of the connection ("Data" tab of the report description).

- add or delete Item controls linked to the SQL query associated with the report.

## Creating a report based on an SQL query with data accessed via a connection
<a name="creating_report_based_sql_query_with_data_accessed_via_connection_ELTTEXTE000318"></a>
To create a report based on an SQL query with data accessed via a connection:

1. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_nouveau.gif) in the quick access buttons.

	- The new element window appears: click "Report" then "Report". 

	- The report creation wizard starts.




2. Choose the layout of your report (table, form, label, ...). For more details, see [The different types of reports](../WDChamp/1011054.md).

3. Select the data source of the report ("From a SQL query by connection").

4. Select the type of connection to use (ODBC or Native Access)

5. Specify the connection parameters:

	- the connection name.

	- the username.

	- the user password.

	- the name of the database accessed (if there is more than one).




6. Enter the SQL code of the query associated with the report. 
	**Caution**: The SQL code must be recognized by the database accessed.

7. To group the records, you have the ability to create breaks on the sort items. To create breaks, answer "Yes" to the question "Do you want to add breaks into the report".
	The next step is used to select the sort items corresponding to the breaks. For more details on breaks, see [Breaks in a report](../WDChamp/1011028.md).

8. For each query item displayed in the report:

	- type the corresponding caption. This caption will be displayed:

		- before the item. For example:<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=etatLibelleFiche.gif)


		- in the column header (for the Table reports). For example:<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=etatLibelleTable.gif)
This caption can be modified in the report editor.

- select the block where the control associated with the item will be printed. The positions of different controls can be modified in the report editor. For more details on the different blocks and their position in a report, see [Report blocks](../WDChamp/1011040.md).

9. Modify (if necessary) the display order of controls in the report with the arrow buttons found on the right of table.

10. Depending on the type of report currently created, indicate the specific options.
	

| Type of report | Specific options |
| --- | --- |
| Report based on a form | Form image, printing the form image, ...<br>Options presented in detail in [Report based on a form](../WDChamp/1011067.md) |
| Label report | Format of labels, number of identical copies, ...<br>Options presented in detail in [Label report](../WDChamp/1011050.md) |



11. Specify the format of sheet on which the report will be printed. The report is printed in A4 format by default.

12. Select the skin template of the report if necessary.

13. Type the name and title of the report (name of ".WDE" file corresponding to the report). This name will identify the report in your programs.

14. Validate the report creation. 

15. The report editor automatically proposes to change the report format if the following conditions are fulfilled:

	- the report currently created includes a table.

	- the report format does not allow to display all table columns.




16. Specify (if necessary) the mode for reducing the report size: 

	- Print the report on several pages. In this case, the end user will have to group the pages. For more details, see [Multi-page print](../WDChamp/1011065.md).

	- Use the landscape mode. 

	- Reduce the report size. Caution: according to the reduction percentage, the printed report may become unreadable. 




17. The report currently created is displayed in the report editor.

## Printing a report based on an SQL query via a connection
<a name="printing_report_based_sql_query_via_connection_ELTTEXTE000342"></a>
To print a report based on an SQL query via a connection, you must:

1. Configure the report print destination:

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) In WINDEV, with [iPreview](../WDLang5/3046069.md) (print preview, print in an HTML file, ...).

	- 
			For more details, see [Print modes of a report](../WDChamp/1011031.md).




2. Specify the name of the report to print with [iPrintReport](../WDLang5/3046032.md).




**Remarks**:

- [ODBCPassword](../Proprietes/2511031.md), [ODBCDatabaseName](../Proprietes/2511034.md), [ODBCConnectionName](../Proprietes/2511033.md) and [ODBCUserName](../Proprietes/2511019.md) used in the report code allow you to find out and modify the connection parameters.

- [ODBCSQLCode](../Proprietes/2511028.md) used in the report code allows you to find out and modify the SQL code of the SQL query.

| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ER.png) | Important | In [Reports & Queries](../Presentation/3088004.md), you can print a report:<br><br>- by starting a print job (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Ico_Imprimer.gif)). <br><br>- by testing the report (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Ico_Go_Fenetre_WD_bl.gif)). <br><br><br>Therefore, no programming is required to print the report. |

### WINDEV and WEBDEV example
<a name="windev_and_webdev_example_ELTPARAGRAPHE000205"></a>

The "RPT_Customer" report is based on an SQL query performed on the Access "Customer" database. This database is accessed via the ODBC driver of Access. By default, this report is used to print all the characteristics of the customers.

The user can:

- click the "BTN_CustomerCharacteristics" button to print all customer characteristics. The SQL code of the query will not be modified.

- click the "BTN_CustomerNames" button to print the first name and last name of customers. The SQL code of the query will be modified.




To find out whether the SQL code of the query must be modified or not, a parameter is passed to the report:

- "True": no modification of the SQL code.

- "False": modification of the SQL code.




**In this example**:

- the click code of the "BTN_CustomerCharacteristics" button is as follows:

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) WINDEV code:
			
		```wl
		// Open the preview window
		iPreview()
		// Print the report with parameters
		iPrintReport(RPT_Customer, "True")
		```





- the click code of the "BTN_CustomerFNameLName" button is as follows:

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) WINDEV code:
			
		```wl
		// Open the preview window
		iPreview()
		// Print the report with parameters
		iPrintReport(RPT_Customer, "False")
		```





- the code of the "Opening" event of the "RPT_Customer" report is as follows:
	
	```wl
	// Retrieve the parameter passed to the report
	PROCEDURE RPT_Customer(Choice)
	IF Choice = "False" THEN
		// Modify the SQL code
		RPT_Customer..ODBCSQLCode = "Select LastName, FirstName FROM Customer"
	END
	```
