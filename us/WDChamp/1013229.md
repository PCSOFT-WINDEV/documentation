### Events supported by WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile
<a name="events_supported_windev_and_windev_mobile_ELTPARAGRAPHE000013"></a>

WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile handle the following events by default (order of appearance in the code editor):


| Event | Runtime condition |
| --- | --- |
| Initializing | Executed when the window is opened. \* |
| Entry | Executed when the input cursor enters the control. |
| Exit | Executed when moving from one control to another (TAB key, selecting another control with the mouse, etc.). |
| Add a token | **This event is only available for "Text token" Edit controls.** <br><br>Executed each time the user adds a token in the control. The token is added when a character specified as a token separator is used. <br><br>This event receives a variable of type [Token](../WDLang1/1000023942.md) as parameter, which allows handling the token that has been added. <br><br>If this event returns: <br><br>- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>, the token is added in the Edit control,<br><br>- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>, the token is not added. The input area of the control is cleared. <br><br><br><br><br>This event is not executed if the addition is done programmatically. <br><br>![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) This event is not available. |
| Delete a token | **This event is only available for "Text token" Edit controls.** <br><br>Executed when the user deletes a token by clicking the "X" icon. <br><br>This event receives a variable of type [Token](../WDLang1/1000023942.md) as parameter, which allows handling the deleted token. <br><br>If this event returns: <br><br>- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>, the token is deleted from the Edit control,<br><br>- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>, the token is not deleted from the Edit control.  <br><br><br><br><br>This event is not executed if an element is deleted programmatically. <br><br>![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) This event is not available. |
| Click token | **This event is only available for "Text token" Edit controls.** <br><br>Executed when a token in an Edit control is clicked. <br><br>This event receives a variable of type [Token](../WDLang1/1000023942.md) as parameter, which allows handling the token that has been clicked on. <br><br>![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) This event is not available. |
| Whenever modified | Executed whenever the content of the control is modified (entering or deleting a character, for example). |


(\*) By default, the "Initialization" event of each control is executed according to the order in which the controls were created in the window. To change this order of execution: 

1. On the "Window" tab, in the "Order" group, click "Initialization". 

2. In the window that appears, use the arrows on the right to change the order in which the controls are initialized.

Several optional events are supported.
To add an optional event:

2. Display the code window of this control (F2 key).

3. Click the link "Add other events to xxx" at the bottom of the window code, after the last event.  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Traitements_optionnels_WD_OK%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)


4. All the optional events available for the control are displayed. 

5. Check the optional event to add and validate. 
	Remark: You can select several optional events. 

6. The selected optional event is automatically added to the events managed by the control.




To disable an optional event, simply perform the same operations to display the list of optional events. Then simply uncheck the optional events to delete. 
Remark: If the disabled code contains WLanguage code, this code is automatically deleted.You can manage the following aspects, for example:

- the mouse hover over the control,

- left mouse button down, up, double click,

- right mouse button down, up, double click, 

- the mouse wheel, etc.







### "Select a value in the list of input suggestions" event
<a name="select_value_the_list_input_suggestions_event_ELTPARAGRAPHE000259"></a>

The optional "Select a value in the list of input suggestions" event is executed when the user selects an element from the list of input suggestions. To handle this event more easily, it is associated with a procedure: 

```wl
PROCEDURE InputSuggestionSelection(MySelection is AssistedInput)
```


The variable of type [AssistedInput](../WDLang1/1410088983.md) contains the characteristics of the element selected in the input suggestions (text displayed and corresponding stored value). 

For example, this event allows you to: 

- get the selected option. 

- change the value displayed in the Edit control after the selection is made. 





```wl
// Add a suggestion
_AutocompleteSuggestion is AssistedInput
_AutocompleteSuggestion.Caption = "Alpharetta, GA 30022"
_AutocompleteSuggestion.StoredValue = 30022
AssistedInputAdd(EDT_PostalCode, _AutocompleteSuggestion)

// -- Event "Select a value in the list of input suggestions"
PROCEDURE Selection(MySelection is AssistedInput)
EDT_PostalCode = MySelection.StoredValue
```
