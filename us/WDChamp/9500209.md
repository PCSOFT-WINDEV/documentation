### Page control
<a name="page_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000011"></a>The "Peeling Corner" control allows you to create visual effects in a page by presenting an image partially covered by another one. When the control is hovered by the mouse cursor, the above image is progressively folded in order to make the underneath image appear, like a peeling corner underneath which the page below would appear.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Cornage1.gif)<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Cornage2.gif)
