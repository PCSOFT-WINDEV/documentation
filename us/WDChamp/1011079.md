## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000191"></a>
The report editor gives you the ability to create "Organizer" reports. 

In this case, the report includes an Organizer control only. This type of control is created when creating an Organizer report: it cannot be created independently of the report. 

Example: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Etat_Agenda%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif&type=thumb)
In the editor, this control includes two blocks: 

- The "Header" block, displaying the titles of the organizer columns. 

- The "Organizer" block, displaying the appointments in an Organizer control.

<a name="creating_the_report_ELTPARAGRAPHE000037"></a>

To create an "Organizer" report: 

1. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_nouveau.gif) in the quick access buttons. 

	- The new element window appears: click "Report" then "Report".

	- The report creation wizard starts.




2. Select an "Organizer or Scheduler" report. 

3. In the rest of the wizard, specify: 

	- the type of report to create ("Organizer report") with the [information specific to the organizer creation](#NOTE2_2): 

		- the initial display mode.

		- the number of days displayed. 

		- the granularity of gridlines. 




- the template used if necessary, 

- the data source of report (data file, query, Organizer control, ...). For more details, see [Report data source](../WDChamp/1011055.md).



<a name="NOTE2_2"></a>


### Information specific to the creation of Agenda report
<a name="information_specific_the_creation_agenda_report_ELTPARAGRAPHE000067"></a>

The information specific to the creation of the Organizer report is:

- Initial display mode: The organizer can be displayed: 

	- on a daily basis,

	- on a weekly basis,

	- on a monthly basis. 




- The granularity of gridlines. This granularity is used to define the size of the grid used to display the gridlines of Organizer control. This granularity is set to 30 minutes by default. This information must be modified according to the number of days to display. 
	This characteristic can be modified in the code via the [GranularityGridlines](../Proprietes/1000020107.md) property. 




**Remark**:  If the Organizer report is linked to a data source (query, data file), you must specify the items that will be taken into account for displaying the appointments. The following information must be specified: 

- the title of appointment. 

- the start and end dates of appointment.

<a name="NOTE3_1"></a>


## Characteristics of Organizer report and Organizer control
<a name="characteristics_organizer_report_and_organizer_control_ELTTEXTE000245"></a>
You have the ability to modify the following characteristics of Organizer report: 

- The data source of Organizer report can be modified in the "Data" tab of the description window of report ("Report description" in the context menu of report). 

- The "General" tab  of the description window of Organizer control is used to specify: 

	- the initial display mode: Day, week, month. 

	- the number of days displayed. 

	- the visible time period. 

	- the first day of the week.

	- the granularity of gridlines.

	- the display of appointments for the entire day. If the "Show all-day appointments" option is checked, the report supports appointments for which the "WholeDay" property is set to true (for more details, see [Appointment variable](../WDLang1/1000019244.md)). In this case, an area used to display the daily appointments appears in the organizer: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Agenda_journee_Etat.gif)
Remark: Make sure that the area used to display the daily appointments has the proper dimensions in the report editor. It can be resized if necessary. 

	- the display mask for the date and schedules. 

	- the custom report to display the appointments. 

		- If the selected option is "None", the default display is used. 

		- If "Preset report" is selected, a preset report is automatically added to the project. This report is named "RPT_WinDevViewAPT" by default and is automatically used to display appointments.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Etat_WinDevvueRDV.gif)
This report can be customized, renamed, etc.

		- If the selected option corresponds to a project report, this report will be used to display the appointments.
						We advise you to customize the report proposed by default.
						The same report can be used to customize the appointments in a Scheduler or Organizer report.  




- If the Organizer control is linked to a data source (data file, query, ...), the "Content" tab found in the description window of the control is used to linked the appointment data with the data found in the data source. 

- The "Style" tab of the Organizer control description window is used to specify the style of the appointments displayed in the Organizer control.
