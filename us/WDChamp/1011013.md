## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000606"></a>
Queries are used to easily select records in one or more data files. Queries can also be used to perform calculations on the selected data. You can, for example, select all the orders for the customers living in New York City and calculate the total amount of orders per customer.

Using queries in a report allows you to easily create complex reports. The query pre-selects the records and the report organizes the selected data and performs the different calculations.

**Caution**: To optimize the report, we advise you to perform the calculations (totals on items for example) in the report (and not in the query).



Several modes can be used to create a report based on a query:

- the query is created and saved in the query editor. The report is based on the file corresponding to the query ( .WDR file). The query can be re-used in another report, window, control, ... The query can be modified at any time in the query editor. ***The query is said to be independent***. 

- the query is created when creating the report. The query is included in the report. No file specific to the query is created. The query can only be modified from the report where it was created. It cannot be re-used in another report, window, control, ... ***The query is said to be embedded***. 

- ***the query is based on data coming from a connection*** (not available in WINDEV Mobile). 
	Remark: This type of report based on a query is available even if no analysis is associated with the WINDEV or WEBDEV project.




**Tip**: You have the ability to create, from the query editor, a report based on the current select query. To do so, on the "Query" tab, in the "Data binding" group, click "Create a report".

**Remark**: An independent query or an embedded query can accept parameters. For more details, see [Report based on a query with parameters](#NOTE4_1).

The report can be easily printed from your WLanguage programs. For more details, see [Printing a report based on a query](#NOTE5_1).

## Report on independent query
<a name="report_independent_query_ELTTEXTE000630"></a>


### Overview
<a name="overview_ELTPARAGRAPHE000115"></a>

The query must be created before the report (for more details, see [Creating a query](../Editeurs/2032059.md)). When creating the report, all you have to do is specify the name of the query used.

If the query is modified in the query editor (deletion of result items for example), a synchronization screen is displayed when closing the query. This allows you to apply the modifications performed on the query to all elements that use this query (including reports).

### Creating a report on independent query
<a name="creating_report_independent_query_ELTPARAGRAPHE000127"></a>

To create a report on independent query:

1. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_nouveau.gif) in the quick access buttons. 

	- The new element window appears: click "Report" then "Report". 

	- The report creation wizard starts.




2. Choose the layout of your report (table, form, label, ...). For more details, see [The different types of reports](../WDChamp/1011054.md).

3. Select (if necessary) the report template to use. A report template is used to comply with a specific page layout. For more details on report templates, see [Report templates](../WDChamp/9000105.md). 

4. Select the data source of report ("From a data file or from an existing query").

5. Select the query on which the report will be based. Only the queries found in the current application are proposed.

6. To group the records, you have the ability to create breaks on the sort items. To create breaks, answer "Yes" to the question "Do you want to add some breaks into the report?".
	The wizard next step is used to select the sort items corresponding to the breaks. For more details on breaks, see [Breaks in a report](../WDChamp/1011028.md).

7. For each item displayed in the report:

	- type the corresponding caption. This caption will be displayed:

		- before the item. For example:<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=etatLibelleFiche.gif)


		- in the column header (for the Table reports). For example:<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=etatLibelleTable.gif)
This caption can be modified in the report editor.

- select the block where the control associated with the item will be printed. The positions of different controls can be modified in the report editor. For more details on the different blocks and their position in a report, see [Report blocks](../WDChamp/1011040.md).

8. Modify (if necessary) the display order of controls in the report with the arrow buttons found on the right of table.

9. If the query associated with the report contains at least one numeric item, you have the ability to perform calculations these items. Specify the calculation performed for each item (sum, average, ...). Two types of calculations are available:

	- ***general calculation***: a Calculated control will be created in the *End of document* block.

	- ***calculation on break***: a Calculated control will be created in the *Break footer* block. In the calculations on break, the result of the calculation is reinitialized after each break. To perform a calculation on break, a break must be found in the report currently created.




10. Depending on the type of report currently created, indicate the specific options.
	

| Type of report | Specific options |
| --- | --- |
| Report based on a form | Form image, printing the form image, ...<br>Options presented in detail in [Report based on a form](../WDChamp/1011067.md) |
| Label report | Format of labels, number of identical copies, ...<br>Options presented in detail in [Label report](../WDChamp/1011050.md) |



11. Specify the format of sheet on which the report will be printed. The report is printed in A4 format by default.
	Remark: By default, the report controls are displayed in a single column. To create a multi-column report, simply specify the desired number of columns in the "Format" tab of the report description window.

12. Select the skin template of the report if necessary.

13. Type the name and title of the report (name of ".WDE" file corresponding to the report). This name will be used to identify the report in your programs.
	![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) You can also specify whether the report can be modified by the end user in "Reports & Queries". 

14. Validate the report creation. 

15. The report editor automatically proposes to change the report format if the following conditions are fulfilled:

	- the report currently created includes a table.

	- the report format does not allow to display all table columns.




16. Specify (if necessary) the mode for reducing the report size: 

	- Print the report on several pages. In this case, the end user will have to group the pages. For more details, see [Multi-page print](../WDChamp/1011065.md). 

	- Use the landscape mode. 

	- Reduce the report size. Caution: according to the reduction percentage, the printed report may become unreadable. 




17. The report currently created is displayed in the report editor.

## Report on embedded query
<a name="report_embedded_query_ELTTEXTE000660"></a>


### Overview
<a name="overview_ELTPARAGRAPHE000225"></a>

The query is created when creating the report. This query will be modified from the report editor ("Edit the query" in the context menu of the report). If modifications are performed in the query, the report editor lists these modifications as well as their incidence on the report.

**Remark**: To switch from the embedded mode to the independent mode (which means to extract a query from a report):

1. Display the report based on the embedded query (in the report editor). 

2. Select "Edit the query" in the context menu of report. Another solution: on the "Modification" tab, in the "Report" group, click "Edit query". The query is displayed in the query editor.

3. On the "Home" tab, in the "General" group, expand "Save" and select "Export .. To an independent query".

4. Save the new query.

4. Select the data source of report ("From a new query").

5. The query creation wizard starts. Select the items used by the query.
	**Remark**: To simplify the selection of items, display them in alphabetical order or by associated file.

6. Define the query characteristics (selection condition, group, sort, etc.) by clicking the corresponding button.
	For more details, see:

	- [selection conditions of a query](../Editeurs/2032019.md),

	- [operations that can be performed in a query](../Editeurs/2032020.md),

	- [sort order of query records](../Editeurs/2032005.md) (this order is important for the breaks).




7. Go to the next step.

8. To group the records, you have the ability to create breaks on the sort items defined in the query. To create breaks, answer "Yes" to the question "Do you want to add some breaks into the report?".
	The next step is used to select the sort items corresponding to the breaks. For more details on breaks, see [Breaks in a report](../WDChamp/1011028.md).

9. For each query item displayed in the report:

	- type the corresponding caption. This caption will be displayed:

		- before the item. For example:
						<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=etatLibelleFiche.gif)


		- in the column header (for the Table reports). For example: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=etatLibelleTable.gif)
This caption can be modified in the report editor.

- select the block where the control associated with the item will be printed. The positions of different controls can be modified in the report editor. For more details on the different blocks and their position in a report, see [Report blocks](../WDChamp/1011040.md).

### Using an item of the embedded query from a code of the report
<a name="using_item_the_embedded_query_from_code_the_report_ELTPARAGRAPHE000368"></a>To access an item of the embedded query from the code of a report, report controls or report blocks, use the following syntax:


```txt
MySource.MyItem
```


<a name="NOTE4"></a>
<a name="NOTE4_1"></a>


## Report based on a query with parameters
<a name="report_based_query_with_parameters_ELTTEXTE000696"></a>
<a name="RptQry_Param"></a>
An independent query or an embedded query can accept parameters. In this case, one or more selection conditions depend on a parameter during the execution of the query. This parameter can correspond to the value of an edit control found a window.

For example, to print the invoice for customer X, all you have to do is create a report based on a query with parameters. In this query, the parameter will be the customer name for example. Therefore, the value of the parameter must be specified before the report is printed:

- during the test of the report based on a query with parameters, a window allows you to type the query parameters.

- at runtime, the query parameters must be specified with [iInitReportQuery](../WDLang5/3046021.md) (before using [iPrintReport](../WDLang5/3046032.md)).


|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ER.png) | Important | If the query is created with Reports & Queries, there is no need to use [iInitReportQuery](../WDLang5/3046021.md) to specify the query parameters. Indeed, when running a report on a query with parameters from Reports & Queries, a window allows you to enter the parameters of the query. |



**Remark**: For more details, see [Query with parameters](../Editeurs/2032045.md).

## Printing a report based on a query
<a name="printing_report_based_query_ELTTEXTE000738"></a>
To print a report based on a query, you must differentiate between two cases:

- Report based on a query without parameters.

- Report on a query with parameters




Remarks:

- If parameters must be passed to the ***report***, these parameters must be specified in [iPrintReport](../WDLang5/3046032.md), after the name of the report to print. For more details, see [Report with parameters](../WDChamp/1011008.md).

- When used in the code of the report, the [SourceName](../Proprietes/2511035.md) property allows you to get and change the name of the query associated with the report.


|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ER.png) | Important | In [Reports & Queries](../Presentation/3088004.md), you can print a report:<br><br>- by starting a print job (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Ico_Imprimer.gif)). <br><br>- by testing the report (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Ico_Go_Fenetre_WD_bl.gif)). <br><br><br>Therefore, no programming is required to print the report.<br><br>When printing a report based on a query with parameters, a window allows you to enter the parameters of the query. |




<a name="NOTE5_2"></a>


### Printing a report based on a query without parameters
<a name="printing_report_based_query_without_parameters_ELTPARAGRAPHE000448"></a>

To print a query without parameters, you must:

1. Configure the report print destination:

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) In WINDEV, with [iDestination](../WDLang5/3046074.md) (report viewer, print in an HTML file, etc.).


 For more details, see [Print modes of a report](../WDChamp/1011031.md).

2. Specify the name of the report to print with [iPrintReport](../WDLang5/3046032.md).
	For example:

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) In WINDEV: to print the "RPT_Query" report:
			
		```wl
		// Open report viewer
		iDestination(iViewer)
		// Print the RPT_Query report
		iPrintReport(RPT_Query)
		```







<a name="NOTE5_3"></a>


### Printing a report based on a query with parameters
<a name="printing_report_based_query_with_parameters_ELTPARAGRAPHE000502"></a>

To print a query with parameters, you must:

1. Configure the report print destination:

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) In WINDEV, with [iDestination](../WDLang5/3046074.md) (report viewer, print in an HTML file, etc.).


 For more details, see [Print modes of a report](../WDChamp/1011031.md).

2. Pass the parameters to the query with [iInitReportQuery](../WDLang5/3046021.md).

3. Specify the name of the report to print with [iPrintReport](../WDLang5/3046032.md).




**For example**: The "RPT_Query" report is based on a query with parameters. The parameters expected by the query are the name and type of the company. These parameters have been entered in the window for starting the report print.

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) WINDEV code:
	
	```wl
	// Open report viewer
	iDestination(iViewer)
	// Pass the parameters to the query associated with the report
	iInitReportQuery(RPT_Query, CompanyName, CompanyType)
	// Print the list of companies
	iPrintReport(RPT_Query)
	```



**Remark**: If some of the parameters expected by the query are not specified (value corresponding to NULL for example), the selection conditions corresponding to these parameters will be ignored.
