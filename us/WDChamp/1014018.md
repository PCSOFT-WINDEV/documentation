## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000159"></a>
A control in a window or page can be associated with an alphanumeric character, a key or combination of keys ("keyboard shortcut"), etc.

This shortcut gives direct access to the control.

**Remark**: By default, you can set a "Hotkey" using the text of the control ('&' character before the letter to be defined as hotkey). For more details, see ["& character"](#NOTE3_1).

### Managing the & character in the window controls

By default, you can use a hotkey as a keyboard shortcut. This hotkey is assigned using the text of the control ('&' character before the letter to be defined as hotkey).

The shortcut associated with to the control will be Alt + Letter after &.

To display the '&' character in a caption, this character must be typed twice. For example:

- "War&Peace" will be displayed as "War<u><u><u><u>P</u></u></u></u>eace" (with Alt + P as hotkey).

- "War&&Peace" will be displayed as "War&Peace".




To define how the '&' character will be interpreted, use the [InterpretAmpersand](../Proprietes/2510151.md) property.

In order for the '&' character to be automatically inserted before the caption of the new controls: 

1. Display the options of the window editor: on the "Home" tab, in the "Environment" group, expand "Options" and select "Options of the window editor". 

2. In the "Controls" tab, check "Automatic hotkey when creating a control".

3. Validate.
