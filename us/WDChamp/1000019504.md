### Events supported by WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile
<a name="events_supported_windev_and_windev_mobile_ELTPARAGRAPHE000013"></a>

WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile manage the following events by default (order of appearance in the code editor):

| Event | Runtime condition |
| --- | --- |
| Initializing | Run when the window is opened. \* |
| Before creating the appointment | Run:<br><br>- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) when "New appointment" is selected in the context menu of Scheduler control.<br><br>- during the direct input of a new appointment via the keyboard.<br><br><br><br><br> |
| ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Enter an appointment in input | Run:<br><br>- when "New appointment" is selected in the context menu of Scheduler control.<br><br>- during the direct input of a new appointment via the keyboard.<br><br><br>This event is run immediately after the event "Before creating the appointment". |
| ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Exit from input for the appointment | Run when exiting the input of an appointment (e.g., exit when adding an appointment or when editing an appointment via the context menu) |
| Selecting an appointment | Run when an existing appointment is selected in the Scheduler control. |
| Moving an appointment | Run when an appointment is moved in the Scheduler control. <br><br>![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) This event is run at the end of the movement with the mouse (when the mouse is "released").<br>**Remark**: The move performed is canceled if this event runs the following line of code: <br><br><pre><code>Result False</code></pre><br><br><br> |
| ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Resizing an appointment | Run when resizing an appointment in the Scheduler control (resize operation performed with the mouse for example). This event is run at the end of the resize (when the mouse is "released"). |
| ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Deleting an appointment | Run:<br><br>- when "Delete the appointment" is selected in the context menu of Scheduler control.<br><br>- when an appointment is deleted via the DEL key of keyboard.<br><br><br> |
| ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Range selection | Run when selecting a time period in the Scheduler control (click performed on a time range for example). When several time ranges are selected with the mouse, the event is run for each new selected range. |
| Whenever changing period | ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Run when modifying the period displayed in the Scheduler control (via the arrow buttons found at the top left of Scheduler control or when the period is changed through programming with [SchedulerDisplayPreviousPeriod](../WDLang1/1000019495.md) and [SchedulerDisplayNextPeriod](../WDLang1/1000019496.md)).<br><br> |
| Reassigning an appointment | Run when moving an appointment triggers the modification of the resource associated with the appointment. |
| ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Whenever changing the display mode | Run when the user changes the display mode of the Scheduler control. The new mode can be known in this event via [SchedulerMode](../WDLang1/1000019992.md). |


(\*) By default, the "Initializing" event of each control is run according to the order in which the controls were created in the window. To modify this order of execution: 

1. On the "Window" tab, in the "Order" group, click "Initialization".

2. In the window displayed, use the arrows on the right to modify the order in which the controls are initialized.






## Events with procedures
<a name="events_with_procedures_ELTTEXTE000378"></a>
To handle appointments in a scheduler more easily, several procedures appear in each event. These procedures take the appointment variable ([Appointment](../WDLang1/1000019244.md) variable) as parameter. All the details of the appointment handled by the context menu are automatically assigned to this variable. 

**Example**: To store an appointment added by the user via the popup menu in an APT data file, simply write in the event "Exit from input for the appointment": 


```wl
PROCEDURE ExitFromInput(aptEdited is Appointment)

// Store the data
APT.Title = aptEdited.Title
APT.StartDate = aptEdited.StartDate
APT.EndDate = aptEdited.EndDate
...
HAdd(APT)
```



### Advanced use of events with procedure
<a name="advanced_use_events_with_procedure_ELTPARAGRAPHE000266"></a>

You can also allow the user to define more precisely the characteristics of his appointment during an addition or a modification. To do so, you must create a window or a page with the information to fill. 

In the code, simply open the window or page in the event "Entry in edit in an appointment". To lock the direct input via the context menu of the scheduler, the event must return <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>. 
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) This principle can be applied to all the events called by the context menu of the Scheduler control. ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Example: 


```wl
PROCEDURE Edit(aptEdited is Appointment)

// Opens the window for entering an appointment 
// with the selected appointment (in Creation or Modification mode)
Open(WIN_InputAPT_HFSQL, aptEdited)

// Returns False to lock the direct input in the Scheduler control
RESULT False
```

## Optional events
<a name="optional_events_ELTTEXTE000408"></a>
Several optional events are supported.
To add an optional event:

1. Select the desired control.

2. Display the code window of this control (F2 key).

3. Click the link "Add other events to xxx" at the bottom of the window code, after the last event.  ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Traitements_optionnels_WD_OK%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)


4. All the optional events available for the control are displayed. 

5. Check the optional event to add and validate. 
	Remark: You can select several optional events. 

6. The selected optional event is automatically added to the events managed by the control.




To disable an optional event, simply perform the same operations to display the list of optional events. Then simply uncheck the optional events to delete. 
Remark: If the disabled code contains WLanguage code, this code is automatically deleted.You can manage, for example:

- the mouse hover over the control,

- left mouse button down, up, with a double click,

- right mouse button down, up, double click, 

- mouse wheel, etc.
