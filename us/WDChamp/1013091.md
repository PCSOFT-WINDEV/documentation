## Overview of the supercontrol
<a name="overview_the_supercontrol_ELTTEXTE000119"></a>
A supercontrol is an advanced type of control. A supercontrol groups a set of controls for a specific purpose. These controls are independent from the processes of the window or page that is hosting them.

**Benefits of supercontrols**: the supercontrols are independent elements that can be easily reused regardless of the window or page where they are used. As they can be included in a dictionary, they can easily be transferred from a project to another one.

**Example**: These three controls constitute a supercontrol. In this example, the button is used to automatically calculate the end date according to the period chosen in the context menu of the button.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=superchamp.gif)
Two types of users are allowed to handle a supercontrol:

- **The creator of the supercontrol**: person who designs the supercontrol as well as its features. For more details, see: [Creating a supercontrol](../WDChamp/1013086.md).

- **The user of the supercontrol**: person who is including the supercontrol in his window (or page) and who will be using it through programming. For more details, see: [Including a supercontrol in a window](../WDChamp/1013092.md).




A supercontrol can include:

- All types of controls, with all their characteristics (popup menu for example).

- Specific procedures. These procedures are local to the supercontrol and they can be used by all the processes associated with the supercontrol or with one of its elements.

- Some variables local to the supercontrol and that can be used by all the processes associated with the supercontrol or with one of its elements.




**Remark**: A supercontrol can be created with a single control: this allows you to define procedures local to this control.
