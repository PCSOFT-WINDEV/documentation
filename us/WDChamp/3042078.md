## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000178"></a>
In a Line chart, it may be difficult to read the value of axes for a point that is far from these axes.

Via the new crosshair included in all charts, the end user precisely knows the pointed value.

All charts with axes automatically benefit from the crosshair.

The user hovers a point in the chart and the crosshair is displayed!

If the vertical crosshair crosses several lines, the value is displayed for each intersection: it is the multiple crosshair.

For a multiple crosshair, the tooltip header can be customized.

### Crosshair in a Chart control
<a name="crosshair_chart_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000041"></a>

The crosshair is available by default for all Chart controls created from version 20. 

To display a crosshair in a Chart control: 

1. Open the Chart control description window.

2. In the "Details" tab: 

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) in the "Zoom and crosshair" area, check "Enable chart crosshair". 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Mire_Graphe_Editeur.gif)
The "Multiple crosshair (stacked lines and columns)" option allows using multiple crosshairs in Line or Column charts. 




3. Validate the control description window. 




**Remarks**: 

- The crosshair is available for the following types of charts: Area, Bubble, Line, Column, MinMax, Radar and Waterfall.

### Crosshair in the AAFs (Automatic Application Features)
<a name="crosshair_the_aafs_automatic_application_features_ELTPARAGRAPHE000090"></a>

If the crosshair is not enabled in a chart, it can be enabled by the user via the context menu of chart ("Enable the crosshair").

### Modifying the multiple crosshair through programming
<a name="modifying_the_multiple_crosshair_through_programming_ELTPARAGRAPHE000097"></a>

By default, the multiple crosshair displays: 

- in header, the category name. 

- the content of different tooltips for the points corresponding to the crosshair. 




It is possible to modify the header of the crosshair tooltip via [grTooltip](../WDLang3/3042010.md) associated with the *grTooltipFormatCrosshairHeader* constant. 

For example: 


```wl
grTooltip(CHART_Chart1, grTooltipFormatCrosshairHeader, "Category: [%CATEGORY%]")
```

### Configuring the crosshair options through programming
<a name="configuring_the_crosshair_options_through_programming_ELTPARAGRAPHE000116"></a>

The crosshair has the following characteristics by default: 

- color based on the color of gridlines in the Chart control. 

- thickness: 1 pixel. 

- opacity: entirely opaque crosshair. 




These characteristics can be modified by the following properties:  



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [CrosshairColor](../Proprietes/1000021505.md) | The **CrosshairColor** property is used to get and change the color of the crosshair in a Chart control. |
| [CrosshairOpacity](../Proprietes/1000021517.md) | The **CrosshairOpacity** property is used to determine and change the opacity of the crosshair in a Chart control. |
| [CrosshairThickness](../Proprietes/1000021506.md) | The **CrosshairThickness** property is used to determine and change the thickness of the crosshair in a Chart control. |
