<a name="NOTE1"></a>
<a name="NOTE1_1"></a>


## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000111"></a>
By default, in password controls, characters are replaced with dots. 

It is now possible to display these characters in a readable format (security risks must be taken into account). 

Starting with version 18, users can click a "Show password" icon in the control: the password will be shown as long as the left mouse button is down. This allows the user to check the password.

## A specific icon

### Implementation
<a name="implementation_ELTPARAGRAPHE000040"></a>

Starting with version 18, this icon is included by default. 

This icon can be configured (like all the options included in the AAFs). For more details, see [Configuring the AAF menus](../Editeurs/2010040.md). 

To prevent the user from showing the password in a given Edit control, use [AAFDisable](../WDLang1/1000022018.md) with the *aafDisplayPassword* constant.

Caution: When a value is assigned to a "Password" Edit control (using the "=" operator or the [FileToScreen](../WDLang4/3044210.md) function for example), the Show password icon is not displayed for security reasons. 
Tip: To bypass this behavior, simply assign the content with [SendKey](../WDLang1/3014014.md): 


```wl
// Assigns a password via SendKey
SendKey(GeneratePassword(18), Handle(EDT_Password))
```
