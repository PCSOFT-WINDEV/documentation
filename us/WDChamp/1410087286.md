## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000108"></a>
In the "General" tab of the Flexbox control description window, you can view and change the options of the different controls integrated into a Flexbox container. 

You can define the anchoring of each control to get the desired behavior in the Flexbox container. 

Remark: These settings also appear in the anchoring options of the control.

## Options of the "General" tab
<a name="options_the_general_tab_ELTTEXTE000132"></a>
For each control in the Flexbox container, you can configure the following aspects: 

- **Width**: Distribution of the positive horizontal free space into "parts".<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Flexbox_General%20-%20HC%20N%B0001%201.gif)


	- **if the width of the flexbox container increases**, the controls will stretch horizontally to fill the available space (flex-grow). The possible values are: 

	- 0: no growing

	- 1: controls will grow equally to fill the horizontal space available. This is the default option.. 

	- other value: controls will grow proportionally using this coefficient to fill the horizontal space available.

- **Height**: Definition of vertical alignment and anchors (align-self). <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Flexbox_General%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif)
The possible values are: 

	- undefined, the control will stretch vertically (stretch)

	- auto, defined by the Flexbox control

	- flex-start

	- center

	- flex-end

	- align texts \* (baseline): Items are aligned so that their text baselines align. 
			Remark: "\*" indicates that this option is ignored in the editor. 


 By default, the control will stretch vertically (stretch).

- **Order**: Controls are displayed following the order defined by this parameter. If no value is specified (undefined or 0), the control is positioned to the right of the previous control. Caution: A control with a position defined by a number can no longer be moved in the editor: it will remain in the position set by that number.

- **Custom CSS anchors**: This option allows you to enter custom CSS code with the desired anchors. This CSS code overrides the previously defined parameters. For example: 
	
	```txt
	flex 20 1 100px;
	```
corresponds to:

	- flex-grow: 20

	- flex-shrink: 1

	- flex-basis: 100px
