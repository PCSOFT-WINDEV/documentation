### WEBDEV session
<a name="webdev_session_ELTPARAGRAPHE000010"></a>

The following operations are performed when a dynamic WEBDEV page is displayed: 

1. Request page display.

2. Start WEBDEV engine. This engine remains on the server until the application is closed.

3. Create the application context. This context remains on the server until the application is closed.

4. The WEBDEV engine executes the server code and builds the HTML page (e.g., from the data in the database).

5. Once the HTML page is entirely built, the server transmits the result to the client (the browser). 







### Page contexts
<a name="page_contexts_ELTPARAGRAPHE000022"></a>

A page context is automatically created on the server whenever a page is displayed in the browser. This page context contains all the elements that have been required to build the page viewed by the end user: 

- global variables,

- local variables,

- server processes, 

- database connections, 

- the file contexts, etc.




The page contexts remain on the server until the end of the WEBDEV session. 

When the same page is called several times: 

- If [PageDisplay](../WDLang2/3058008.md) is called to display the page, the page context is destroyed and recreated. 

- If [PageRefresh](../WDLang2/3058011.md) is called to display the page, the same page context is reused.

### Programming
<a name="programming_ELTPARAGRAPHE000049"></a>

The WEBDEV session and the page contexts are automatically managed by default. No programming is required.

## Operating mode of Active WEBDEV Pages

### What is an Active WEBDEV Page?
<a name="what_active_webdev_page_ELTPARAGRAPHE000059"></a>

An Active WEBDEV Page is a dynamic WEBDEV page **without persistent context** on the server. The Active WEBDEV Page context is temporary. It is created in a temporary session. 

Reminder: In a dynamic WEBDEV site, each displayed page owns a persistent page context for the entire lifetime of the session on the server. 


### Operating mode of AWP sites
<a name="operating_mode_awp_sites_ELTPARAGRAPHE000066"></a>

The following elements are automatically created on the server when an Active WEBDEV Page is displayed in the browser: 

- a temporary session,

- a temporary Active WEBDEV Page context. 




The temporary session contains all the elements that have been used to build the page viewed by the Web user: 

- local variables,

- server processes, 

- database connections, 

- the file contexts, etc.




When the Active WEBDEV Page is sent to the Web user, these elements are destroyed.

### How to share information (values) between Active WEBDEV Pages?
<a name="how_share_information_values_between_active_webdev_pages_ELTPARAGRAPHE000086"></a>

There are two methods to share information (values) between Active WEBDEV Pages:

- Passing information in the URL. This method allows for better SEO.

- Saving information in the AWP contexts (through programming).

**Passing information (values) between two pages in the URL**
It is possible to pass information from one page to another via the URL. The URL has the following format: "http:\\\\Web server\\...\\mypage.awp?NameParam1=Value1&NameParam2=Value2".
This method allows a better page SEO because the information passed in the URL is visible and analyzed by the SEO robots.

**Saving information (values) in the AWP contexts (through programming)**
You have the ability to store on the server values common to several Active WEBDEV Pages, via the AWP contexts. An AWP context is created on disk on the server. This context is available as long as Active WEBDEV Pages are displayed and as long as the timeout of AWP contexts is not exceeded. The timeout of AWP contexts is defined in the WEBDEV administrator ("Configuration" tab, "Duration of AWP contexts" option).
To manage AWP contexts, you must use WLanguage functions such as [DeclareAWPContext](../WDLang2/3058028.md), [FreeAWPContext](../WDLang2/1000020429.md), etc, ...
For more details, see [AWP: Managing contexts](../WDChamp/3539060.md).
