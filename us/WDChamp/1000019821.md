## Overview

An Organization Chart control can be used to display a diagram. It can be used, for example, to display the different steps of a process. 



## How to?

The Organization Chart control is well-suited to perform this type of diagram even though specific settings are required. 

In an Organization Chart control, each element can have a single parent. 

In most cases, the representation is reversed in a process diagram: a child element is created from several parent elements. 

Therefore, a reversed Organization Chart control must be created. To do so, simply: 

1. **Define the elements in the reverse order of the process**.
	The first "parent" element must be the last element of the diagram (in our example, the first element of the organization chart is "Absolute" that is the final element in the diagram). 
	The "child" elements of diagram must be defined as "parent" elements in the organization chart (in our example, the "Warm up, cool down, filter" step is defined as child of "Absolute" while it is the previous step in the diagram). 

2. **Display the organization chart from "right to left"** (or from "bottom to top") to "restore" the proper direction of the diagram.
