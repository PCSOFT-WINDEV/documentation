## Events managed by default
<a name="events_managed_default_ELTTEXTE000100"></a>
WINDEV manages the following events by default (in order of appearance in the code editor):

| Event | Runtime condition |
| --- | --- |
| Initialization | Run when the window is opened. (\*) |


(\*) By default, the "Initializing" event of each control is run according to the order in which the controls were created in the window. To modify this order of execution: 

1. On the "Window" tab, in the "Order" group, click "Initialization".

2. In the window displayed, use the arrows on the right to modify the order in which the controls are initialized.

- the mouse hover over the control,

- left mouse button down, up, with a double click,

- right mouse button down, up, double click, 

- mouse wheel, etc.
