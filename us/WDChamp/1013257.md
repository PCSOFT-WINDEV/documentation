**Caution: Do not confuse "Internal Window control" and "Internal window": the "Internal window control" is a type of control while the "Internal window" is a type of window.**

WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile manage the following events by default for the **"Internal Window" controls**:


| Event | Runtime condition |
| --- | --- |
| Selection by swipe | **Internal window with browse by swipe**.<br><br>Run once the new internal window was displayed and loaded.<br><br>For more details, see [Changing the content of an internal window via a swipe](../WDChamp/1013277.md). |
| After loading the internal window | Run when the internal window is changed by [ChangeSourceWindow](../WDLang1/3038053.md). This event is run after the "Global declarations" and "Initializing" events of the new internal window.<br><br>This event allows you, for example, to initialize controls or to restore values in the internal window.<br><br>[ChangeSourceWindow](../WDLang1/3038053.md) must not be used in this event. |
| Before unloading the internal window | Run when the internal window is changed by [ChangeSourceWindow](../WDLang1/3038053.md). This event is run before the closing event of the initial internal window.<br><br>This event is used, for example, to save the values present in the internal window.<br><br>[ChangeSourceWindow](../WDLang1/3038053.md) must not be used in this event. |



WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile manage the following events by default for the **Internal Windows**: 


| Event | Runtime condition |
| --- | --- |
| Declaration of global variables | Declaration of variables global to the window. This is the first code run when opening the window.<br>This code is run before the declaration code of the global variables of the host window (window in which the internal window is included).<br>You can, for example, call a procedure of the internal window from the declaration code of global variables of the host window. |
| End of initialization | Run when the window is opened.<br>The events are run in the following order:<br><br>- Initializing the window controls<br><br>- Initializing the window<br><br>- Focus gain<br><br><br> |
| Closing | Executed when closing the window.<br>**Remark**: Resuming the input in one of the window controls in this code prevents from closing the window. |
| ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Request for refreshing the display | Used to group the code for updating the window controls: content of controls, state (visible, grayed, etc.), caption to refresh, etc.<br><br>This event can receive parameters. Simply declare a procedure in the event. For example: <br><br><br><pre><code>// Request for refreshing the display<br>PROCEDURE AskForRefresh(RefreshType is Boolean)</code></pre><br><br><br>This event is started upon request by the following functions: <br><br>- [RequestRefreshUI](../WDLang1/1000023899.md) or [RequestRefreshUIParent](../WDLang1/1000023900.md): Executes the event at the end of the current event (asynchronous execution). <br><br>- [ExecuteRefreshUI](../WDLang1/1000023901.md) or [ExecuteRefreshUIParent](../WDLang1/1000023902.md): Executes the event immediately. <br><br><br>When these functions are called, you can specify the value of the parameters expected by the event. |
| Entry | Optional event:<br>Run when the cursor enters in the Internal Window control.  |
| Exit | Optional event: <br>Run when changing control (when going from the Internal Window control to another control of the window). |
| Whenever modified | Run whenever the control content is modified |
| Set the Value property | Executed each time the ***Value*** property is specified for the Internal Wndow (directly or with the Value property). This code is used to retrieve the parameters passed to the internal window for example. |
| Get the Value property | Executed each time the ***Value*** property of the internal window is retrieved. This code allows the internal window to return a value to the window that hosts the Internal Window control. |

## Optional events
<a name="optional_events_ELTTEXTE000353"></a>


### Overview
<a name="overview_ELTPARAGRAPHE000173"></a>Several optional events are supported.
To add an optional event:

1. Select the desired control.

2. Display the code window of this control (F2 key).

3. Click the link "Add other events to xxx" at the bottom of the window code, after the last event.  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Traitements_optionnels_WD_OK%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)


4. All the optional events available for the control are displayed. 

5. Check the optional event to add and validate. 
	Remark: You can select several optional events. 

6. The selected optional event is automatically added to the events managed by the control.




To disable an optional event, simply perform the same operations to display the list of optional events. Then simply uncheck the optional events to delete. 
Remark: If the disabled code contains WLanguage code, this code is automatically deleted.You can manage, for example:

- the mouse hover over the control,

- left mouse button down, up, double click,

- right mouse button down, up, double click, 

- mouse wheel, etc.
