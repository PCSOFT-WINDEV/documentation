## Overview

<a name="Sequencing"></a>
In some cases, it may be necessary to print a series of reports, and view them at the same time in the report viewer. 

The composite reports can be used for this purpose when the sequence of reports is known in advance. 

If the sequence is not known in advance and if it must be programmed, the sequence of reports can be used through programming.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Enchainement_Etats.gif&type=thumb)
 
![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png)![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) Remark: You also have the ability to add into the sequence: 

- a Word Processing document.

- a PDF document.

- an XLS or XLSX document.

- a diagramdocument.

## How to?
<a name="how_ELTTEXTE000201"></a>
<a name="NOTE2_1"></a>
To sequence the reports through programming: 

1. To add: 

	- a report to the sequence, use [iSequencingAdd](../WDLang5/1000020059.md). This function must be used for each report that will be added to the sequence. This function is used to pass parameters to the report to print. 

	- ![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png)![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) a Word Processing document to the sequence, use [iSequencingAddDoc](../WDLang5/1000023089.md). This function is used to specify the Word Processing document o print.

	- ![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png)![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) a PDF document to the sequence, use [iSequencingAddPDF](../WDLang5/1000023468.md). This function is used to specify the PDF document to print.

	- ![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png)![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) an XLS or XLSX document to the sequence, use [iSequencingAddXLS](../WDLang5/1000023518.md). This function is used to specify the XLS or XLSX document to print.

	- ![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png)![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) a diagram (WDDiag file) to the sequence, use [iSequencingAddDiagram](../WDLang5/1410088662.md). This function is used to specify the diagram document to print.




2. To end the sequence and to start the print, use [iSequencingPrint](../WDLang5/1000019903.md). 




Example: 


```wl
MyDocument is Document = "c:\temp\generalconditions.docx"
MySpreadsheet is string = "c:\temp\prices.xls"

// Print in the report viewer
iDestination(iViewer)

// Add reports into the sequence
iSequencingAdd(RPT_Report_Portrait)
iSequencingAdd(RPT_Report_Landscape, 3)
// Add the general conditions in document format
iSequencingAddDoc(MyDocument)
// Add prices in the format of an XLS worksheet
iSequencingAddXLS(MySpreadsheet)
iSequencingPrint()
```


**Remarks**: 

- The pages of the reports found in the sequence are numbered sequentially. The numbering can be modified by [iPageNum](../WDLang5/3046013.md). 

- The reports found in the sequence can have different orientations (portrait and/or landscape). 

- The reports are not run when running [iSequencingAdd](../WDLang5/1000020059.md): only their name and their parameters are stored. 
	These reports are actually run during the call to [iSequencingPrint](../WDLang5/1000019903.md). 
	Caution: If the reports found in the sequence are based on a query, the query must be initialized by [iInitReportQuery](../WDLang5/1000003046021.md) in the initialization code of the report (and not before the call to [iSequencingAdd](../WDLang5/1000020059.md)).
