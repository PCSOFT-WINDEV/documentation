The ActiveX control is used to easily manage the ActiveX technology. The ActiveX controls are reusable components that use the ActiveX technology and that can be included in a window.


### Creating an ActiveX control

## Tips
<a name="tips_ELTTEXTE000127"></a>
If your application uses an ActiveX, you must take some precautions:

- only the 32-bit ActiveX can be used.

- the ActiveX must be installed according to the setup procedure on the user computer (see the documentation about the ActiveX if necessary).

- the wd280ole.dll DLL and the WINDEV application must be installed at the same time on the user computer.
