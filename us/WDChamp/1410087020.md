<a name="overview_the_word_processing_control_ELTTEXTE000270"></a>
The "Word processing" control is an advanced control that allows the end user to create and edit documents in docx format directly on a WINDEV application. There are many advantages: time saving, consistent interface, no other software to install/drive/manage. 

This control allows you to: 

- Open, create, modify and save "docx" files,

- Convert docx files to PDF or to HTML to send emails,

- Manage images and tables,

- Manage text areas, 

- Save documents in HFSQL databases,

- Use a spelling checker,

- Perform prints, ...




The ribbon of this control includes the most common actions. For more details, see [Word processing: using the ribbon](../WDChamp/1410087025.md).

## Characteristics of Word Processing control
<a name="characteristics_word_processing_control_ELTTEXTE000322"></a>
The "General" tab in the description window of the Word Processing control proposes the following options: 

- **Initial document**: Used to indicate the initial document displayed in the Word Processing control.  

- **With ribbon**: Indicates whether the ribbon must be displayed or not. If the ribbon must be displayed, you can specify the ribbon used via "Ribbon source IW".
	If **"Ribbon source IW"** corresponds to: 

	- "None": the ribbon proposed by default will be used. 

	- "Preset window": the ribbon proposed by default can be customized.
			Simply select the default preset window in "Ribbon source IW". In this case, the "IW_WinDevAAF_WPBar" window is automatically included in your project. This internal window (available in English and French) can be modified according to your needs. This window contains all the code required to manage the Word Processing control. It is recommended to check for UI errors and make sure the window works properly after any change is made. 

	- Project internal window: Allows you to use an internal window to propose a specific ribbon.
			Any internal window of your project can be used to create this bar.


 You also have the ability to apply the project skin-template. 

- **Allow change of document (Open, New, etc.)**: Adapts the ribbon to allow the user to handle external documents. This option is used to display the "New", "Open" and "Save" buttons of ribbon. If this option is checked, the document opening and backup must be performed by the application. 
	Remark: This option is ignored if the ribbon is entirely customized (with an internal window of application for example).  

- **Limit the edit to simplify the HTML export**:  Adapts the ribbon and the display of document to only display the options taken into account by the HTML export. If this option is checked: 

	- the following options are not available: 

		- Management of headers and footers,

		- Management of page layout,

		- Management of page breaks. 




- the document is forced to be displayed in "Display for the Web" mode.

- **Enable [Check spelling] by default**: Specifies whether the spelling checker should be enabled. For more details, see [Check spelling based on Hunspell dictionaries](../WDChamp/1410087030.md). 

- **Automatically detect and format links**: Enables automatic detection of links (http) present in the document displayed in the control. In this case, links are detected during input, after pressing Space, Tab or Enter. If these links are valid, they can be opened with Ctrl + Click.
	Remark: This option is checked by default.  




**Caution**: This control cannot display or accept input of characters from right to left.
