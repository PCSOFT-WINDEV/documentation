## Type of chart and associated characteristics
<a name="type_chart_and_associated_characteristics_ELTTEXTE000339"></a>
The type of chart defined in the "General" tab corresponds to the general type of chart. 

The available options depend on the selected type of chart: 

- **Pie/Donut/Semi-circular/Sunburst**

	- Raised effect: Raised effect that can be given to the chart drawing. Depending on the charts, you have the ability to give a simple effect (by specifying the depth, in pixels) or a 3D effect. 
			

	- Start angle (in degrees): : Angle used for the beginning of the first section. 

	- Show labels of categories: Used to display (or not) the category labels. 

	- Size of hole (in percent):  (Donut and Sunburst charts only): Size of the hole displayed in the middle of the chart. 

	- Show percentages: Used to display the percentages of each section, by specifying the format used. 

	- Explosion offset (in pixels): : Used to pull out the chart sections. 




- **Column/Horizontal Column**

	- Raised effect: Raised effect that can be given to the chart drawing. Depending on the charts, you have the ability to give a simple effect (by specifying the depth, in pixels) or a 3D effect. 
			

	- Layout: Layout of bars: grouped, stacked or in depth. You also have the ability to use cylindrical bar (but not rectangular ones). 




- **Line/Area/Scatter**

	- Raised effect: Raised effect that can be given to the chart drawing. Depending on the charts, you have the ability to give a simple effect (by specifying the depth, in pixels) or a 3D effect. 
			

	- Smooth series: Used to smooth a chart via the "cubic splines" method. 
			

	- Point size

	- Drawing of null values: the null values can be ignored, not drawn, or they can correspond to a return to the value 0. 




- **Bubble chart**

	- Raised effect: Raised effect that can be given to the chart drawing. Depending on the charts, you have the ability to give a simple effect (by specifying the depth, in pixels) or a 3D effect. 
			

	- Size of bubbles (in percentage)

	- Show labels of categories: Used to display (or not) the category labels. 

	- Used to specify what is represented by the series value: surface of bubble, radius of bubble or volume of bubble. 




- **Surface**: 

	- Raised effect: Raised effect that can be given to the chart drawing. Depending on the charts, you have the ability to give a simple effect (by specifying the depth, in pixels) or a 3D effect. 
			

	- X-axis rotation (degrees): Define the chart rotation. 

	- Y-axis rotation (degrees): Define the chart rotation.

	- Z-axis rotation (degrees): Define the chart rotation.

	- Show mesh on the surface: Enables or disables the mesh on a Surface chart.

	- Rotate with the mouse
(charts with less than 10 000 points): Enables (or not) the ability for the user to perform a chart rotation with the mouse. 




- **Radar** 

	- Show gridlines: Enables (or not) the display of gridlines on the chart. 

	- Show labels of categories: Used to display (or not) the category labels. 

	- Size of points: Defines the size of points. 




- **Funnel**

	- Raised effect: Raised effect that can be given to the chart drawing. Depending on the charts, you have the ability to give a simple effect (by specifying the depth, in pixels) or a 3D effect. 
			

	- Neck width (%) / Neck height (%): characteristics of funnel stem. 

	- Hide first value: You have the ability to display (or not) the total value in the Funnel chart. 

	- Show labels of categories: Used to display (or not) the category labels. 

	- Spacing between the sections: : Spacing between the different funnel sections. 

	- Size of sections: The size of sections can be: 

		- Proportional to the area: The value is symbolized by the area of funnel section.

		- Proportional to the height: The value is symbolized by the height of funnel section.




- **Candlestick/Barchart/MinMax**

	- Raised effect: Raised effect that can be given to the chart drawing. Depending on the charts, you have the ability to give a simple effect (by specifying the depth, in pixels) or a 3D effect. 
			

	- Cylindrical bars: Ability to use cylindrical bar (but not rectangular ones). 







![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) For a composite chart, you have the ability to define a type of chart associated with each series and to configure the display options of the series.

## X-axis and Y-axis
<a name="xaxis_and_yaxis_ELTTEXTE000363"></a>
It is possible to define the following elements for the X and Y axes: 

- **Axis title**: This title will be displayed along the X or Y-axis. 

- **Marks**: If the default mark is chosen, the mark will be calculated according to data. You have the ability to choose a value in the list or to enter your own value. 

- **Orientation of X marks**: The orientation of the mark captions can be horizontal, vertical or automatic. In this last case, the orientation is defined by taking the control size and the mark length into account. 

- **Minimum and maximum values of axes**: Extreme values of axes. If these values correspond to "Default", they are defined from the data found in the different chart series. You can enter a value or select one of the proposed values. 

- **Location of marks on the X-axis in pixels**: corresponds to the spacing between column charts. 
	Remark: This type of chart is not available in the report editor. 

- **X-axis scale adapted to date/time (grAddTimeData)**: Allows you to use a time scale. 
	This option operates with Date or DateTime data coming from a Table control or from an HFSQL item. This option cannot be used with a series filled through programming.

- **Format of marks on the Y-axis**: Display mask for the marks. 

- **Logarithmic scale**

## Marker and gridlines
<a name="marker_and_gridlines_ELTTEXTE000387"></a>
You can use: 

- an orthonormal marker. The available options are: 

	- Not orthonormal: the X and Y axes are using different units for the marker. 

	- Orthonormal (primary axis only): the X and Y axes are using the same unit for the marker. 

	- Orthonormal (primary and secondary axes): the X and Y axes are using the same unit for the marker as well as the secondary axis.




- a horizontal and/or vertical gridlines.
