## Characteristics of maximized windows
<a name="characteristics_maximized_windows_ELTTEXTE000228"></a>


### Title bar
<a name="title_bar_ELTPARAGRAPHE000026"></a>

The title bar is used to display the title of the window. This title bar can be displayed (or not) via "With title bar" in the "Style" tab of the description window.

### Action Bar
<a name="action_bar_ELTPARAGRAPHE000035"></a>

Android 3 allows you to insert an Action Bar into your applications. 

The "Actions bars" replace the title bar of a window and they are used to display various information:

- the application icon,

- the window title,

- some menu options,

- ...


For more details, see [Action Bar of a window](../WDChamp/1000025001.md).

### Tabs
<a name="tabs_ELTPARAGRAPHE000054"></a>

The tabs are used to display information about the different panes. The user will only have to choose the requested tab.

For more details on this control, see [Tab control](../WDChamp/1013194.md).

### Scrollbar
<a name="scrollbar_ELTPARAGRAPHE000066"></a>

The scrollbars will be automatically displayed if the size of the window is greater than the resolution of the screen on the Android device used.

This option can be chosen at any time in the window description ("Details" tab).

**Caution**: In full-screen mode, the automatic scrollbars are never displayed in a maximized window.

### Menu
<a name="menu_ELTPARAGRAPHE000077"></a>

In an application for Android, this menu is located at the bottom of the windows. A drop-down menu allows the user to quickly access one of the features of the application.

In edit, the menus of the Android windows are presented like simple drop-down menus.

At runtime, these menus will be displayed differently according to the number of options:

- If the menu contains less than 6 options, it is displayed like large buttons at the bottom of the screen.

- If the menu contains more than 6 options, the first 5 options are displayed like large buttons and a sixth automatic button ("Plus") allows the user to see the rest of menu like a drop-down menu.




The menus of Android applications support a single level of submenus. Beyond this limit, a fatal error occurs when running the application.

Adding a drop-down menu to a window or deleting a drop-down menu from a window can be done at any time:

- on the "Window" tab, in the "Bars and menus" group, expand "Main menu" and select "Add main menu".

- in the "Style" tab of the window description ("Enable main menu").

## Size of a maximized window
<a name="size_maximized_window_ELTTEXTE000276"></a>
The usable size of a maximized window depends on the elements taken into account in the window (title bar visible or not, ...).

WINDEV Mobile allows you to configure all these elements in your windows for Android: 

- The "Style" tab of the window description is used to configure: 

	- The display of the title bar 

	- The display of the system bar




- The "Details" tab of the window description is used to configure the size of the window:

## Additional options
<a name="additional_options_ELTTEXTE000300"></a>
The "Details" tab can also be used to configure the management of the window orientation. Indeed, when the user modifies the orientation of his Android device, the window can: 

- follow the orientation of the device. In this case, the anchors allow you to define a window that can be used in portrait mode and in landscape mode. 

- be locked in portrait mode.

- be locked in landscape mode.




**Remark**: When changing the display mode (portrait to landscape or conversely), the new size of the window is represented by a dotted line in the window editor. All you have to do is resize the window via the handles and position the controls.
