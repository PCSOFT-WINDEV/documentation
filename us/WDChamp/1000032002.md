<a name="events_managed_default_ELTTEXTE000095"></a>
WEBDEV manages the following events by default (order of appearance in the code editor):

| **Event** | **Runtime condition** |
| --- | --- |
| Initialization (server code) | Executed when the page is opened. \* |
| Click (browser code) | Run during the click in the Rich Text Area control. |
| Mouse moved (browser code) | Run when moving the mouse over the Rich Text Area control. |


(\*) By default, the "Initializing" event of each control is run according to the order in which the controls were created in the page. To modify this order of execution: 

1. On the "Page" tab, in the "Edit" group, expand "Tab order" and select "Edit". 

2. In the window displayed, use the arrows on the right to modify the order in which the controls are initialized.




Remark: The controls in the Rich Text Area control have their own events.
