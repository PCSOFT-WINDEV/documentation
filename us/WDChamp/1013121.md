## Overview of Toolbar control
<a name="overview_toolbar_control_ELTTEXTE000119"></a>
The Toolbar control is an advanced type of control, linked to a window. A toolbar contains several controls (button, edit control, combo box, ...) allowing the user to quickly start some features of his application.

A toolbar can be:

- **Anchored**: the toolbar is "attached" to one of the window borders.

- **Floating**: the toolbar is an independent window.

## Creating a Toolbar control

### To create a Toolbar control:
<a name="create_toolbar_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000029"></a>

1. On the "Window" tab, in the "Bars and menus" group, expand "Other bars" and select "Toolbar".

2. Click at the desired location to create the control. The control appears in the editor.




To view the characteristics of the control, select "Description" in the context menu. The different positions allowed for the toolbar (docked or floating) can be configured in the "Details" tab.

**Caution: No control should be positioned near a toolbar**: If controls are positioned near the toolbar currently created (on the left of a horizontal toolbar or below a vertical toolbar), these controls will be automatically moved (and therefore they might disappear) when the user modifies the toolbar position. For example:
<a name="NOTE2_2"></a>


### Associating controls with the toolbar

**To associate existing controls with the toolbar**:
**Solution 1**: Drag and Drop the control to the "Toolbar" control.
**Solution 2**: In the control description ("General" tab), click the "Add" button and select the control that will be added to the toolbar. The selected control is automatically created in the toolbar.

**To associate new controls with the toolbar**:
**Solution 1**: Drag and Drop the control to the "Toolbar" control.
**Solution 2**: In the control description ("General" tab), click the "Add" button and select the type of control that will be added to the toolbar. The selected control is automatically created in the toolbar. To modify it, click the "Edit" button: the description of the new control is displayed.

**Remark**: The spacing between the controls found in the toolbar can be configured in [the "Details" tab of the toolbar description](../WDChamp/1013119.md).
