WEBDEV manages the following events by default (order of appearance in the code editor):


| Event | Runtime condition |
| --- | --- |
| Initializing (Server code) | Executed when the page is opened. |
| Click on link (Browser code) | Executed when the user clicks the link. This code is always executed, regardless of the type of link. |

**Remark**: Only the browser codes are available in a static page.

## Sequence for executing the codes of the links
<a name="sequence_for_executing_the_codes_the_links_ELTTEXTE000196"></a>
Two click codes are associated with the links:

- **a browser click code**, which can be written in WLanguage (or JavaScript) in the code editor. This code is included in the HTML page and is executed on the user's computer.

- **a server click code**, which can be written in WLanguage only. This code is executed on the server.




The table below presents the code executed according to the type link and the associated action. The target of the link does not affect the order in which the code is executed.


|   |   |   |   |

## Optional events
<a name="optional_events_ELTTEXTE000220"></a>
Several optional events can be managed.

To add an optional event:

1. Select the desired control.

2. Display the code window of this control (F2 key).

3. Click the link "Add other events to xxx" at the bottom of the window code, after the last event.  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Traitements_optionnels_WD_OK%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)


4. All the optional events available for the control are displayed. 

5. Check the optional event to add and validate. 
	Remark: You can select several optional events. 

6. The selected optional event is automatically added to the events managed by the control.




To disable an optional event, simply perform the same operations to display the list of optional events. Then simply uncheck the optional events to delete. 
Remark: If the disabled code contains WLanguage code, this code is automatically deleted.

You can manage, for example:

- the mouse hover over the control,

- left mouse button down, up, double click,

- right mouse button down, up, double click, 

- mouse wheel, etc.
