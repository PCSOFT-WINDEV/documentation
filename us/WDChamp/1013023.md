## Overview of the Combo Box control
<a name="overview_the_combo_box_control_ELTTEXTE000443"></a>


### Control in a window, control in a dynamic or static page
<a name="control_window_control_dynamic_static_page_ELTPARAGRAPHE000011"></a>

The Combo Box control displays a list of elements and allows users to select an element from the list.

Unlike a List Box, a Combo Box control is not expanded: the control is expanded on a user action or when the cursor is positioned on the list.

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) In WINDEV, you can:

- enter a value in the edit control if the Combo Box control is editable.

- display elements in a table-like format if the Combo Box control contains multiple columns.

- display elements in a ListView-like format.

- [opening a popup window](../WDChamp/1010031.md).

- adjust the width and height of the expanded list via the Combo Box control (see below)

## Creating a Combo Box control
<a name="creating_combo_box_control_ELTTEXTE000467"></a>


### To create a Combo Box control:
<a name="create_combo_box_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000090"></a>

1. On the "Creation" tab, in the "Usual controls" group, click "Combo Box".

2. Click at the desired location to create the control in the page or window. The Combo Box control creation wizard starts automatically.




![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) **Tip**: You can include ready-to-use Combo Box controls in your applications (with associated data and code if necessary) by expanding the "Combo Box" option. A list shows a preview of the available controls with the project skin template and a "Go" icon that allows you to directly test the desired control. Simply click the control you want to create in the editor.

To view the characteristics of the control, select "Description" in the context menu.

![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) For applications in Windows Store Apps mode, it is recommended to use a native Combo Box (select "Native Combo Box" in the "Details" tab of the control description window).

### Type of the Combo Box control expanded area
<a name="type_the_combo_box_control_expanded_area_ELTPARAGRAPHE000124"></a>

The type of Combo Box control expanded area depends on the elements displayed by the Combo Box control . 

To change the type of the Combo Box control expanded area, select "Expanded type" in the "Content" tab of the Combo Box description window ("Description" in the context menu).

The available types are as follows:

### Editable Combo Box: type and mask of the input area
<a name="editable_combo_box_type_and_mask_the_input_area_ELTPARAGRAPHE000187"></a>

In editable Combo Box controls, you can configure the edit control used: 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png) define the type of data entered: Text, Numeric, Currency, Date, Time, Duration.

- define an input mask. This mask depends on the type of information (date, text, etc.) displayed in the Combo Box control. Several input masks are available for each type.
	These input masks are multilingual: different input masks can be selected according to the runtime language of the project.
	These input masks can be modified programmatically with the [InputMask](../Proprietes/2510033.md) property.

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png) define a display mask. This display mask is available for editable Combo Box controls whose type is: Numeric, Currency, Date, Time or Duration. 
	These display masks are multilingual: different display masks can be selected according to the runtime language of the project.
	These display masks can be modified programmatically with the [DisplayMask](../Proprietes/1000020008.md) property.

<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Combo_des_saisie%201.gif)

### Adjusting the size of the expanded area
<a name="adjusting_the_size_the_expanded_area_ELTPARAGRAPHE000231"></a>

The size of the expanded area can be: 

- automatically managed by WINDEV. In this case, it automatically adapts to the content (default). 

- defined in the editor. In this case, the size is fixed. 




The size of the expanded area can be specified in the "Height" option, in the "Details" tab of the control description window. If this option is set to 0, the height of the expanded area is set automatically.  

If the size of the expanded area is not automatically set, it can be adjusted in the editor: 

1. Select the Combo Box control in the window.

2. Click the "Spin" button of the Combo Box control. The mouse cursor turns into a vertical arrow. The Combo Box expanded area is displayed as a rectangle.

3. Resize the expanded area as needed with the black handle.




To resize the Combo Box expanded area with pixel precision:

1. Open the description window of the Combo Box control ("Description" in the context menu).

2. In the "Details" tab, specify (in pixels) the size of the expanded area ("Height" and "Width").




**Remarks**:

- By default, the width of the expanded area corresponds to the width of the input area in the Combo Box control.

- By default, the height of the expanded area is optimized according to the elements displayed in the Combo Box control ("Height" set to 0 in the "Details" tab of the Combo Box description window).

- To enable end users to resize the expanded area directly in the application (using the expanded area resizing handle), check "Resizable" in the "Details" tab of the Combo Box control description ("Description" in the context menu).

- To save the size of the expanded area when the end user closes the window, check "Remember size" in the "Details" tab of the Combo Box description window ("Description" in the context menu). Thus, when the window is opened again, the expanded area will be the same size as the last time.

### Non-editable Combo Box: Search in the values of the Combo Box control
<a name="noneditable_combo_box_search_the_values_the_combo_box_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000269"></a>

For non-editable Combo Box controls that list a large amount of information, you can propose a search area allowing the user to easily find the element to select. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=RechercheFAA%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif)


To implement this feature: 

- from the editor: check "With search" in the "Details" tab of the non-editable Combo Box description. 

- programmatically: use the [SearchAAF](../Proprietes/1000023445.md) property. 




Remark: The hint text "Search" is automatically displayed in the search area of the Combo Box control. This text cannot be configured.

### Drawing in Combo Box controls
<a name="drawing_combo_box_controls_ELTPARAGRAPHE000302"></a>

You can draw or display an image in Combo Box controls via the [drawing functions specific to the List Box and Combo Box controls](../WDLang1/3029028.md).

Remark: If a row of a Combo Box control displays an image via [gImage](../WDLang1/3029042.md), when this row is selected, the image is re-used in the main row.

## Vocabulary
<a name="vocabulary_ELTTEXTE000551"></a>
To easily handle a Combo Box control, you must be familiar with the following vocabulary:

| Name | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Selection bar | Allows you to view the selected element in the expanded area. A specific color is used in most cases. |
| Combo Box based on a data file | The Combo box control is based on a data file or query. The control elements correspond to the file records.<br>There are two types of Combo Box controls based on a data file:<br><br>- ***Combo Box control with in-memory data source***: The content of the control is loaded in memory then it is displayed in the control. Access to the elements of the Combo Box control is faster. This mode is reserved for data files with less than 100,000 records.<br><br>- ***Combo Box control with direct access to the data source (no limit)***: The control displays the content of the data file or query. The current record corresponds to the selected element. Selecting an element in the control triggers an access to the linked data file. This type of control is reserved for data files with more than 100,000 records.<br><br><br> |
| Combo Box populated programmatically | The Combo Box control is not based on a data file or query. The elements displayed in the Combo Box control are defined by the developer (in the description window or through programming). |
| Editable Combo Box | The user can enter text in the edit control associated with the Combo Box. If "Assisted input" is selected, the user can easily select the element by typing the first letters: the letters typed are automatically completed with the corresponding element. |
| Non-editable Combo Box | The user selects an element in the expanded area via the selection bar. |
