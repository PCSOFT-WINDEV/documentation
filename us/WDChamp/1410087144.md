### Events supported by WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile
<a name="events_supported_windev_and_windev_mobile_ELTPARAGRAPHE000031"></a>

The following events are proposed by default (in order of appearance in the code editor):

| Event | Runtime condition |
| --- | --- |
| Initializing | Run when the window is opened. \* |
| Click on a link | Run when a link is clicked on in the HTML Display control. Only external links (to another page) trigger this event. Internal links (to an anchor in the same page for example) do not trigger this event. <br><br>This event accepts parameters: <br><br><pre><code>PROCEDURE ClickLink(sURL is string, bInNewWindow is boolean, <br>	sDestination is string)</code></pre><br>where &lt;sURL&gt; is an optional string that contains the URL of the link clicked in the HTML Display control. <br><br>If this event returns <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>, the action associated with the link will not be performed.<br> <br>Caution: the code must not contain slow processes or process that allow the control to regain focus. In this case, the default action will still be performed.<br><br>Code example: <br><br><br><pre><code>// Open links with a new window as destination, <br>// in another specific window of the application<br>PROCEDURE ClickLink(sURL is string, bInNewWindow is boolean, <br>	sDestination is string)<br>IF bInNewWindow THEN<br>	// Open another requested window: <br>	// opening process of the other window, <br>	// delayed so that the current process responds <br>	// before opening the new window<br>	OpenNewBrowser(sURL)	<br>	RESULT False // Overrides default behavior<br>ELSE<br>	RESULT True // Keeps default behavior<br>END<br><br>INTERNAL PROCEDURE DisplayNewBrowser(sURLParam) <Delay=10ms> <br>	// Important: specify a delay, even if it is very small<br>	<COMPILE IF ConfigurationType = Android OR ConfigurationType = iOS><br>		OpenMobileWindow(WIN_POPUP, sURLParam) <br>	<ELSE>	<br>		OpenChild(WIN_POPUP. sURLParam) <br>	<END><br>END</code></pre><br> |
| Before loading the HTML page | Run before loading the HTML document in the HTML Display control. If the user navigates using links in the HTML Display control, this event is run once each HTML document displayed in the control has been loaded. <br><br>This event accepts parameters: <br><br><pre><code>PROCEDURE ChangePage(sURL is string, sDestination is string)</code></pre><br>where &lt;sURL&gt; is an optional string that contains the URL of the page to be displayed. <br><br>If this event returns <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>, the page will not load. |
| After loading the HTML page | Run after the HTML document has been loaded in the HTML Display control. If the user navigates using links in the HTML Display control, this event is run once each HTML document displayed in the control has been loaded. |
| Load resources | Allows you to be notified and prevent application scripts or images from being loaded (for security purposes, for example). <br><br>This event accepts parameters: <br><br><pre><code>PROCEDURE LoadResources(sURL is string, nType is int)</code></pre><br> where: <br><br>- &lt;sURL&gt; is a character string that corresponds to the URL of the resource to load.<br><br>- &lt;nType&gt; is a constant used to identify the type of resource to be downloaded: <br><br>	- *typehtmlImageRes*: the resource to download is an image. <br><br>	- *typehtmlScriptRes*: the resource to download is a script. <br><br>	- *typehtmlCssRes*: the resource to download is a CSS style.  <br><br>	- *typehtmlXMLHttpRequestRes*: the resource to download is an XML document generated as response to an HTTP request. <br><br>	- *typehtmlOther*: the resource to download is of an unknown type. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>If this event returns <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>, the resource will not be loaded. |
| Right click on a link | Run when the user right-clicks on a link (to open a context menu). This event has the following format: <br><pre><code>PROCEDURE RightClickLink(sURL is string)</code></pre><br> where &lt;sURL&gt; is a string that contains the URL of the link. |


(\*) By default, the "Initializing" event of each control is run according to the order in which the controls were created in the window. To modify this order of execution: 

1. On the "Window" tab, in the "Order" group, click "Initialization". 

2. In the window displayed, use the arrows on the right to modify the order in which the controls are initialized.

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) Several optional events are supported.
To add an optional event:

1. Select the desired control.

2. Display the code window of this control (F2 key).

3. Click the link "Add other events to xxx" at the bottom of the window code, after the last event.  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Traitements_optionnels_WD_OK%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)


4. All the optional events available for the control are displayed. 

5. Check the optional event to add and validate. 
	Remark: You can select several optional events. 

6. The selected optional event is automatically added to the events managed by the control.




To disable an optional event, simply perform the same operations to display the list of optional events. Then simply uncheck the optional events to delete. 
Remark: If the disabled code contains WLanguage code, this code is automatically deleted.You can manage, for example:

- the mouse hover over the control,

- left mouse button down, up, with a double click,

- right mouse button down, up, double click, 

- mouse wheel, etc.
