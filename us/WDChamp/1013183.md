## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000096"></a>
A Table control populated programmatically is directly linked to lists stored in memory. This control automatically uses advanced methods to handle lists.

One Table control populated programmatically corresponds to multiple lists used in parallel. Therefore:

- all the columns contain the same number of elements.

- column indices remain synchronized.

- adding or inserting a row in the Table control inserts an element in all columns.

- deleting a row in the Table control will delete an element in all columns.




The content of the Table control must be assigned programmatically.

## Columns of Table controls populated programmatically
<a name="columns_table_controls_populated_programmatically_ELTTEXTE000120"></a>
The columns of a Table control populated programmatically can be:

- linked to a memory area (memory area associated with the control),

- calculated each time a row is displayed (calculated columns). For example, this is the case of columns used to make calculations based on data present in the current row.




**For the calculated columns**:

- the column content is recalculated whenever a row is displayed. It is not stored.

- the formula of a calculated column must be written in the "Displaying a table row" event of the Table control.

- it is not recommended to use editable columns. The events associated with a calculated column (entry, exit and modification) are of no use.
