## Overview

### Reminder
<a name="reminder_ELTPARAGRAPHE000011"></a>

WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile propose two types of masks:

- the ***input masks*** that define the characters that can be typed in the controls found in a window or in a page. Sometimes, these masks can also be used to modify the case (uppercase/lowercase characters) of the values assigned to the window controls or to the page controls through programming.

- the ***display masks*** that define the characters that can be: 

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) displayed in the window controls.

	- printed in the report controls.

## Default display masks
<a name="default_display_masks_ELTTEXTE000269"></a>
By default, when creating a Duration control: 

- the "Duration defined by the project" input mask is selected: the information defined in the parameters for managing the durations for the project is automatically taken into account. Reminder: These parameters are defined for each language in the "Languages" tab of project description: 

	1. On the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, click "Description".

	2. Select the "Languages" tab then the "Duration" tab.




- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) the "Same mask as the input" display mask is selected.




Remarks: 

- A list of preset masks is proposed in the description window of the control. You can:

	- select a preset mask.

	- create a custom mask.




- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) To display a relative duration (the number of days passed since a date for example), you also have the ability to use a Date control with a "Relative duration" display mask. For more details, see [Input and display masks for the Date edit controls](../WDChamp/1014016.md).

## The custom masks
<a name="the_custom_masks_ELTTEXTE000293"></a>
The following elements can be used to define a custom mask (case sensitive). 
To present the custom masks, let's take a duration equal to 0 day 04 hours 15 minutes 03 seconds and 412 thousandths of a second:

- **+1**: only the most significant unit will be displayed (the number of hours in our example)

- **+2**: only the two most significant units will be displayed (the number of hours and the number of minutes in our example)
	Specify '+3' or '+4' to display the three or four most significant units.

- **D**: the number of days will be displayed if this number is greater than 0 (the number of days will not be displayed in our example)

- **H**: the number of hours will be displayed if this number (or if the number of days) is greater than 0. If this number contains a single digit, this digit will be displayed (the number of hours will be '4' in our example)

- **HH**: the number of hours will be displayed if this number (or if the number of days) is greater than 0. If this number contains a single digit, this digit will be preceded by '0' (the number of hours will be '04' in our example)

- **M**: the number of minutes will be displayed if this number (or the number of days, or the number of hours) is greater than 0. If this number contains a single digit, this digit will be displayed (the number of minutes will be '15' in our example)

- **MM**: the number of minutes will be displayed if this number (or the number of days, or the number of hours) is greater than 0. If this number contains a single digit, this digit will be preceded by '0' (the number of minutes will be '15' in our example)

- **S**: the number of seconds will be displayed if this number (or if the number of days, or the number of hours, or the number of minutes) is greater than 0. If this number contains a single digit, this digit will be displayed (the number of seconds will be '3' in our example)

- **SS**: the number of seconds will be displayed if this number (or if the number of days, or the number of hours, or the number of minutes) is greater than 0. If this number contains a single digit, this digit will be preceded by '0' (the number of seconds will be '03' in our example)

- **CC**: the number of hundredths of a second will be displayed (in our example, the number of hundredths of a second will be '41')

- **CCC**: the number of thousandths of a second will be displayed (in our example, the number of thousandths of a second will be '412')




**Remark**: If the separator corresponds to the ":" character, the letter corresponding to the most significant unit will be added ('h' for hour, 'm' for minute, 's' for second, 'cs' for hundredths of a second and 'ms' for thousands of a second).

## The preset masks
<a name="the_preset_masks_ELTTEXTE000317"></a>
The following masks are proposed (in the order in which they appear in the window editor, page editor or report editor):

- '+2D d HH:MM:SS:CC'

- '+2D d H:M:S:CC'

- '+2D d HH:MM:SS:CCC'

- '+2D d HH:MM:SS'

- '+2D d H:M:S'

- '+2D d H h MM m SS s CCC ms'

- '+2D d H h M m S s CCC ms'

- '+2D d H h MM m SS s'

- '+2D d H h M m S s'

- '+1D d HH:MM:SS:CC'

- '+1D d H:M:S:CC'

- '+1D d HH:MM:SS:CCC'

- '+1D d HH:MM:SS'

- '+1D d H:M:S'

- '+1D d H h MM m SS s CCC ms'

- '+1D d H h M m S s CCC ms'

- '+1D d H h MM m SS s'

- '+1D d H h M m S s'

- '+D d HH:MM:SS:CC'

- '+D d H:M:S:CC'

- '+D d HH:MM:SS:CCC'

- '+D d HH:MM:SS'

- '+D d H:M:S'

- '+D d H h MM m SS s CCC ms'

- '+D d H h M m S s CCC ms'

- '+D d H h MM m SS s'

- '+D d H h M m S s'

- '+2D day(s) HH h. MM min. SS sec. CC'

- '+2D day(s) HH h. MM min. SS sec. CCC'




**Remark**: If the separator corresponds to the ":" character, the letter corresponding to the most significant unit will be added ('h' for hour, 'm' for minute, 's' for second, 'cs' for hundredths of a second and 'ms' for thousands of a second).
