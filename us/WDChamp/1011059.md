### Special cases
<a name="special_cases_ELTPARAGRAPHE000057"></a>

- If the selection includes charts, they will not be copied. 

- If the report contains text in RTF, don't forget to use the *iRTFWithImagesAndTables* constant ([iParameter](../WDLang5/3046008.md)) to optimize the text selection.
