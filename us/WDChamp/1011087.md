A search feature is automatically available when previewing a report, via the "Find" pane. This search is performed in all pages displayed in the report viewer.

This feature is available for the prints performed with the report editor (or with "Reports & Queries") and for the programmed prints (performed with the WLanguage functions).

Reminder: The report viewer is available: 

- in the report editor of WINDEV, WEBDEV, WINDEV Mobile. 

- in "Reports and Queries".

- when printing reports from a WINDEV application.
