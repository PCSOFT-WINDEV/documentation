	From version <B>18</B>, the framesets are available for backward compatibility with the former sites. However, they are not supported in HTML 5 and they are not recommended for the referencing and/or for the navigation from mobile devices. <br>We advise you to replace the framesets by pages that share page templates and/or control templates.

## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000136"></a>
By default, a frameset is used to display several pages in the same window of the browser. One of the pages displayed in the frameset can be a frameset itself: we talk of "Nested framesets".

The nested framesets can be used to perform outstanding page layout for example.

For example:

![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=FrameSupport.gif)


<a name="NOTE2"></a>
<a name="NOTE2_1"></a>

### Nesting the framesets

To nest the framesets:

1. Display the main frameset in the page editor.

2. Select the frame where the frameset should be displayed. The outline of selected frame appears in red.

3. On the "Page" pane, in the "Edit" group, expand "Frame" and select "In support frame".

4. Display the description of the support frame ("Description" from the popup menu of the support frame).

5. Select the project page corresponding to the frameset to display. 
	Caution: The frameset will not be displayed in the editor but only when the project or the page is run.

6. The initial status of the frameset is automatically updated: the new initial status of the frameset takes the support frame into account.
	Caution: Most browsers do not support the recursive nesting of framesets. You cannot:

	- nest the frameset N in the frameset N.

	- nest a frameset containing the frameset N in the frameset N.

### Changing a support frame into a standard frame
<a name="changing_support_frame_into_standard_frame_ELTPARAGRAPHE000060"></a>

To transform a support frame into a "normal" frame: 

1. Display the main frameset in the page editor.

2. Select the support frame. The outline of selected frame appears in red.

3. On the "Page" pane, in the "Edit" group, expand "Frame" and select "In standard frame".


Caution: This operation does not change the initial status of the current frameset: the initial status still contains the support frame. To define the initial frameset status, on the "Page" pane, in the "Edit" group, expand "Frame" and select "Define the initial status".
