## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000103"></a>
Polar Area charts are similar to Pie charts. However, each segment has the same angle. The value is not represented by the angle of the segment, but by the radius.

This type of chart is mainly used to compare target values or market shares, or to illustrate a progress percentage.
