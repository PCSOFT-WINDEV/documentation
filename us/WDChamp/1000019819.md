<a name="events_managed_default_ELTTEXTE000231"></a>
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile manage the following events by default (order of appearance in the code editor): 


| Event | Runtime condition |
| --- | --- |
| Initializing | Run when the window is opened. \* |
| Whenever changing position | Run whenever the display is modified, especially:<br><br>- when the user scrolls with his finger or the mouse, <br><br>- when [MapDisplayPosition](../WDLang3/1000019787.md) is used,<br><br>- when assigning [Value](../Proprietes/2510130.md).<br><br><br> |


(\*) By default, the "Initializing" event of each control is run according to the order in which the controls were created in the window. To modify this order of execution: 

1. On the "Window" tab, in the "Order" group, click "Initialization".

2. In the window displayed, use the arrows on the right to modify the order in which the controls are initialized.

4. All the optional events available for the control are displayed. 

5. Check the optional event to add and validate. 
	Remark: You can select several optional events. 

6. The selected optional event is automatically added to the events managed by the control.




To disable an optional event, simply perform the same operations to display the list of optional events. Then simply uncheck the optional events to delete. 
Remark: If the disabled code contains WLanguage code, this code is automatically deleted.




### Optional event: Modify a marker cluster
<a name="optional_event_modify_marker_cluster_ELTPARAGRAPHE000164"></a>

The "Modify a marker cluster" event  is executed when a Map control containing clusters is displayed. This event is executed for each marker cluster found. It is mainly used to change how the cluster is displayed. 

This event has the following format: 

```txt
PROCEDURE ModifCluster(arrMarker is array of Markers)
```
where arrMarker is an array containing variables of type Marker associated with the cluster. 
This event can return: 

- nothing or an empty string: in this case, the default appearance of the cluster will be used.

- an image path: this image will be used to represent the cluster. 

- a variable of type [MarkerImage](../WDLang3/1000025796.md), used to customize the cluster image.
