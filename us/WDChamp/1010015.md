## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000160"></a>
The MDI windows must respect some constraints specific to the MDI applications. Three types of windows are available: MDI parent window, MDI child window and MDI sibling window.

The window that opens another window is called **parent window** ; the windows opened by the parent window are called **child windows**. All the child windows opened by the same parent window are **sibling windows**.

For more details, see [The different types of windows](../WDChamp/1010024.md).

The operations performed on the menu options are the same, no matter whether the menu belongs to an MDI window or not. However, additional features are available in the MDI windows:

- using [groups of menu options](../WDChamp/1010015.md) to display some menu options in the MDI parent window.

- displaying the [list of opened MDI child windows](../WDChamp/1010015.md) in the main menu of MDI parent window.




Remark: For more details about the menus and menu options, see:

- [Managing popup menus in a WINDEV application](../WDChamp/1010011.md).

- [Managing main window menus](../WDChamp/1010010.md).

## Groups of menu options

### Overview
<a name="overview_ELTPARAGRAPHE000051"></a>

WINDEV allows you to display some menu options in the MDI parent window only when a MDI child window is opened. Simply:

- associate the menu options to display with a group.

- associate the MDI child window with this same group.




Example: The groups of menu options are used to manage the features proposed to the users according to their access rights.

Remarks:

- The same menu option can be displayed when opening several child windows. All you have to do is associate this option with several groups.

- In order for an option to be displayed regardless of the opened child window, no group must be associated with this option.

3. Click the "Group" button. The list of existing groups is displayed.

4. Create a new group if necessary.

5. Associate the option with the group (check the corresponding box). <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=GroupeOption.gif)

WINDEV allows you to display the title of the opened MDI child windows in the main menu of the MDI parent window. The title of the current window is preceded by a checkmark. To display one of the opened windows, all you have to do is select its title.
