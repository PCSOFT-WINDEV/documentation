## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000162"></a>
The user can filter the content of a Table control by displaying the records corresponding to a condition for example.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=S%E9lectionner%20vos%20donn%E9es%20gr%E2ces%20aux%20filtres.jpg)
Remark: These filter options are also available for TreeView Table controls.

## How to?
<a name="how_ELTTEXTE000186"></a>


### Filter on a column
<a name="filter_column_ELTPARAGRAPHE000020"></a>This feature is automatically implemented in Table controls populated programmatically and in Table controls based on a data file, for columns with search (magnifier displayed in the column). Simply right-click the search icon to open the context menu of the column:  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Table_menuTriColonne.gif)
For managing filters, this context menu proposes:

- to implement a filter ("Filter"): 
	To do so, select a condition and type the requested value. The content of the Table control is filtered according to the specified condition.
	Remark: The "Is empty" condition is used to display only empty elements in the column.

- to set a filter with one of the values in the column.

- to delete a filter that was previously set on the column ("Delete filter"). 

- to remember filters ("Remember filters").
	If this option is enabled: 

	- the filters implemented when closing the window will be automatically run during the next window opening. 

	- A short message will be displayed to inform the user and to indicate the filters that are set. 

		- The display duration of this message can be configured by [AAFConfigure](../WDLang1/1000022108.md). 

		- The toast does not lock the application and can be closed with a simple click.







**Remarks**: 

- The context menus displayed when you right-click the column title and the search icon are different. For more details on the options of this context menu, see [Context menu of columns](../WDChamp/9500125.md). 

- In a multilingual application, you have the ability to translate the context menu, see [Configuring the menus of AAFs](../Editeurs/2010040.md).

## Managing the filters through programming
<a name="managing_the_filters_through_programming_ELTTEXTE000210"></a>


### Proposing a filter through programming
<a name="proposing_filter_through_programming_ELTPARAGRAPHE000070"></a>

[TableEnableFilter](../WDLang1/1000017149.md) is used to create a filter on a column through programming. This filter can be disabled by [TableDisableFilter](../WDLang1/1000017150.md).

[TableFilteredColumn](../WDLang1/1000020517.md) returns the list of columns filtered by the user.
<a name="NOTE3_2"></a>


### Don't propose the context menu for implementing a filter on the columns
<a name="dont_propose_the_context_menu_for_implementing_filter_the_columns_ELTPARAGRAPHE000086"></a>

To avoid proposing the context menu for implementing a search and a filter on the columns, use [AAFDisable](../WDLang1/1000022018.md) associated with the *aafFilter* constant.
<a name="NOTE3_3"></a>


### Storing filters
<a name="storing_filters_ELTPARAGRAPHE000098"></a>

The [StoreFilterAAF](../Proprietes/1000020058.md) property is used to determine and specify if the filters set by the user on a Table control are saved when an application is closed and opened again.

When [AAFConfigure](../WDLang1/1000022108.md) is used with the *aafToastDurationRestoreFilter* constant, it allows you to define the amount of time a toast message appears on the screen to indicate the users that a filter has been set. 

If you don't want to show the "Remember filters" and "Remember sorts" options in the context menu, simply use [AAFDisable](../WDLang1/1000022018.md)  with the *aafSaveFilterAndSort* constant.
