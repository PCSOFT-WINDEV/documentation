## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000148"></a>
When creating a report, the test of this report can be run from the report editor.

You also have the ability to include this report in your applications. The user will have the ability to print the report from a button, a menu option, ... for example.

In the iPhone or iPad applications or in the applications in Universal Windows App mode, the report can be printed in PDF format only. Then, this PDF file can be printed, viewed, emailed, ...

![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) You now have the ability to print reports from an application in Universal Windows App mode.

## Principle for printing in an iPhone/iPad application or in Universal Windows App mode
<a name="principle_for_printing_iphoneipad_application_universal_windows_app_mode_ELTTEXTE000172"></a>
The principle for printing a report is straightforward: a PDF file is created when printing the report. Then, all you have to do is open this PDF file in the appropriate software and print it on the printer configured for the computer used. 

Regardless of the type of report to print, the principle for printing a report is as follows:

1. Specify the print mode of report (generation of a PDF file) with [iDestination](../WDLang5/3046074.md).

2. Start the print job in PDF format with [iPrintReport](../WDLang5/3046032.md).

3. Then, you will have the ability to:

	- display the generated file on the user computer ([ShellExecute](../WDLang1/3035007.md)).

	- ...







**Caution**: Check the following points:

- You must have the rights to write into the directory where the document will be generated.
	If you generate a report in PDF format, this file can be saved in the data directory (path returned by [fDataDir](../WDLang1/3036001.md)).

- Use a specific name for each generated document. Otherwise, several simultaneous prints would overwrite the prints already performed. 




This principle must be adapted according to the data source used in each report.

Example: 


```wl
// Impression du bon de commande
NomFichier = fRepDonnées() + [fSep()] + ChaîneConstruit("BDC_%1.PDF", NuméroCommande)
iDestination(iPDFGénérique, NomFichier)
iImprimeEtat(ETAT_BonDeCommande, NuméroCommande, NuméroCommande)

// Test de l'existence du fichier
SI fFichierExiste(NomFichier) = Faux ALORS
	Erreur("Le fichier PDF n'a pas été généré")
	RETOUR
FIN

// Confirmation pour afficher le PDF
SI OuiNon(Oui, "Afficher le bon de commande généré (format PDF)?") = Oui ALORS	
	// Affichage du bon de commande généré
	LanceAppliAssociée(NomFichier)
SINON
	iImprimePDF(NomFichier)
FIN
```
