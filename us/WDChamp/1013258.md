### Events supported by WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile
<a name="events_supported_windev_and_windev_mobile_ELTPARAGRAPHE000013"></a>

WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile manage the following events by default (order of appearance in the code editor):

| Event | Runtime condition |
| --- | --- |
| Initializing | Run when the window is opened. \* |
| Modifying the displayed pane | Run whenever the content of the control is modified (change of tab pane for example) |
| ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Creating a pane | Run when creating a dynamic tab pane via the addition button ("+") found among the tab panes. <br><br>If no internal window has been specified in the interface, use [TabOpen](../WDLang1/1000021369.md) in the code to open a new dynamic tab. <br><br>If an internal window was specified in the interface and if this event is using [TabOpen](../WDLang1/1000021369.md), this event will have priority over the internal window specified in the interface. |
| ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Closing a pane | Run when closing a dynamic tab pane via the closing cross. |


(\*) By default, the "Initializing" event of each control is run according to the order in which the controls were created in the window. To modify this order of execution: 

1. On the "Window" tab, in the "Order" group, click "Initialization". 

2. In the window displayed, use the arrows on the right to modify the order in which the controls are initialized.

## Special case: Modifying and closing a tab pane
<a name="special_case_modifying_and_closing_tab_pane_ELTTEXTE000207"></a>
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) The events "Modifying the displayed pane" and "Closing a pane" can accept a parameter, only for a dynamic Tab control, if the tab pane was created dynamically. 

This procedure must be declared as follows: 


```txt
PROCEDURE <Procedure name>(<Name of Internal Window>)
```


This allows you to find out the name of internal window used. 

For example: 


```wl
// Event "Closing a pane" 
PROCEDURE OnEnd(xIW)

MyIntWin is Control <-xIW
IF MyIntWin <> Null THEN
	Trace(MyIntWin.Name)
END
```

## Optional events
<a name="optional_events_ELTTEXTE000231"></a>
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png)![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Several optional events are supported.
To add an optional event:

1. Select the desired control.

2. Display the code window of this control (F2 key).

3. Click the link "Add other events to xxx" at the bottom of the window code, after the last event.  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Traitements_optionnels_WD_OK%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)


4. All the optional events available for the control are displayed. 

5. Check the optional event to add and validate. 
	Remark: You can select several optional events. 

6. The selected optional event is automatically added to the events managed by the control.




To disable an optional event, simply perform the same operations to display the list of optional events. Then simply uncheck the optional events to delete. 
Remark: If the disabled code contains WLanguage code, this code is automatically deleted.You can manage, for example:

- the mouse hover over the control,

- left mouse button down, up, with a double click,

- right mouse button down, up, double click, 

- mouse wheel, etc.
