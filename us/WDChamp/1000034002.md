## Default events

WINDEV manages the following events by default (in order of appearance in the code editor):


| Event | Runtime condition |
| --- | --- |
| Initializing | Executed when the window is opened. \* |


(\*) By default, the "Initializing" event of each control is executed according to the order in which the controls were created in the window. To modify this order of execution: 

1. On the "Window" tab, in the "Order" group, click "Initialization".

2. In the window that appears, use the arrows on the right to change the order in which the controls are initialized.

- left mouse button down, up, double click,

- right mouse button down, up, double click, 

- mouse wheel, etc.
