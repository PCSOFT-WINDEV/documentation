## Overview of PDF Reader control
<a name="overview_pdf_reader_control_ELTTEXTE000316"></a>
The "PDF Reader" control is an advanced control that allows end users to view PDF documents in their applications, without an external software. No need to start an external reader. You know what all end user will see, which makes user support much simpler.



The PDF Reader control can be included in a window of your application (like any other control), or the PDF reader can be opened in a new window (like any standard reader).

This control allows you to:
