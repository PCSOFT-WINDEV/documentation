### Characteristics by tab
<a name="characteristics_tab_ELTPARAGRAPHE000060"></a>

The description window shows the characteristics of the selected control(s) in different tabs:

| Tab | Characteristics |
| --- | --- |
| **General** | Allows you to specify the name and the display options of the control. For example:<br><br>- the control caption (this caption can be multilingual).<br><br>- the type of information displayed in the control (text, numeric, ...).<br><br>- the display mask used for the control (the mask can be multilingual). <br><br>- the image displayed in an Image control, the type of bar code used in a Bar Code control, the type of chart used in a Chart control, etc. For more details, see the online help of the desired type of control.<br><br><br> |
| **UI** | Used to define:<br><br>- the print parameters of control (visible, breakable, ...). <br><br>- the control size.<br><br>- the control position in the report and in the block to which the control belongs.<br><br>- the control anchoring.<br><br>- the associated group of controls. <br><br>- the associated plane. <br><br><br> |
| **Link** | Used to define the item or the variable found in the data source to which the control is linked. The value of this item or variable will be displayed in the control.<br><br>To link the control to an item or to a variable that belongs to the data source of report, select this item in the "Linked item" list.<br><br><br><br>To link the control to an item that does not belong to the data source of report, select "Multi-file" then select the item linked to the current control. |
| **Remark** | Allows you to describe the detailed operating mode of the control.<br>This information will be printed in the technical documentation (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_imprimer.gif) icon on the "Home" tab, "General" group).<br><br>This information can be get and set programmatically using the [Note](../Proprietes/2510085.md) and [NoteTitle](../Proprietes/2510121.md) properties. |

## Main print parameters of report controls
<a name="main_print_parameters_report_controls_ELTTEXTE000559"></a>
The print parameters of a control are as follows (defined in the "UI" tab of the description window):

| Parameter | Description | Available for the following controls |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ***Visible*** | The control can be displayed or hidden. This characteristic can be modified programmatically with the [Visible](../Proprietes/2510138.md) property. | [Static](../WDChamp/1013179.md), [Item](../WDChamp/1013059.md), [Calculated control](../WDChamp/1013212.md), [Image](../WDChamp/1013218.md), [Bar code](../WDChamp/1013010.md), [RTF control](../WDChamp/1013056.md), [Preset control](../WDChamp/1013058.md), [Chart](../WDChamp/1013006.md), [Shape](../WDChamp/1013102.md), [Internal Report control](../WDChamp/1013044.md) |
| ***Auto-resizing*** | The control size defined in the report editor can be enlarged according to the control content. The controls that follow the "auto-resizing" control will be moved automatically. <br>**Remarks**:<br><br>- If a control is not an auto-resizing control, its content can be truncated if the control size is too small.<br>	To get the height of an auto-resizing control when enlarged, use the [FutureHeight](../Proprietes/2511061.md) property.<br><br>- If a control in a block is auto-resizing, the associated block will automatically be auto-resizing. A block containing auto-resizing controls is auto-resizing. A block containing no auto-resizing control is not auto-resizing.<br><br>- The controls in a page footer cannot be auto-resizing.<br><br><br>**Limit**: In a Label report, controls cannot be auto-resizing. | [Static](../WDChamp/1013179.md), [Item](../WDChamp/1013059.md), [Calculated control](../WDChamp/1013212.md), [Shape](../WDChamp/1013102.md), [Bar code](../WDChamp/1013010.md), [Internal Report control](../WDChamp/1013044.md) |
| ***Multiline*** | The control content can be displayed over several lines. This characteristic can be modified programmatically with the [Multiline](../Proprietes/2510105.md) property.<br>**Remarks**:<br><br>- The control height must be sufficient to display several lines.<br><br>- To modify the control height through programming, use [Height](../Proprietes/2510050.md).<br><br>- If an orientation angle is applied to a multiline control, the automatic CR characters are ignored. Only the manual CR characters are taken into account.<br><br><br> | [Static](../WDChamp/1013179.md), [Item](../WDChamp/1013059.md), [Calculated control](../WDChamp/1013212.md), [Preset control](../WDChamp/1013058.md) |
| ***Breakable*** | The content of a breakable control can be printed over several pages if there is not enough space to print the entire control on a page.<br>**Remarks**:<br><br>- In order for a control to be a breakable control, the block containing the control must also be breakable.<br><br>- If there is not enough space on the current page to print a non-breakable control, the entire control will be printed on the next page.<br><br><br> | [Static](../WDChamp/1013179.md), [Item](../WDChamp/1013059.md), [Calculated control](../WDChamp/1013212.md), [Image](../WDChamp/1013218.md), [Bar code](../WDChamp/1013010.md), [RTF control](../WDChamp/1013056.md), [Preset control](../WDChamp/1013058.md), [Chart](../WDChamp/1013006.md), [Shape](../WDChamp/1013102.md) |
| ***Blank if zero*** | The control value is displayed only if the control value differs from 0.<br>If the control value is equal to 0, the control displays an empty string (""). | [Static](../WDChamp/1013179.md), [Item](../WDChamp/1013059.md) |
| ***Ellipsis (long captions will end with '...')*** | The ellipsis is used to indicate that a caption is too long to be entirely displayed. The following characters are added to the caption: "...". These characters can be added at the end of caption or in the middle of the text (recommended when displaying file paths). | [Item](../WDChamp/1013059.md), [Calculated control](../WDChamp/1013212.md) |
| ***Displayed when the value changes*** | The control value is displayed only if the value of linked item changes when going to the next record in the data source of report. | [Item](../WDChamp/1013059.md), [Calculated control](../WDChamp/1013212.md) |
| ***Reset to 0 after print*** | The control value is automatically reset to 0 once it was printed.<br>This parameter is often used for the calculations on break. | [Calculated control](../WDChamp/1013212.md) |
| ***RTF*** | The control value can be in RTF.<br>**Reminder**: RTF is used to take into account the attributes of characters (bold, italic, underline, etc.) in a text. | [Static](../WDChamp/1013179.md), [Item](../WDChamp/1013059.md), [RTF control](../WDChamp/1013056.md) |
| ***Use the Shared Information at runtime*** | The control will display the "shared information" of the item linked to the control (and not the subscript corresponding to this "shared information").<br>For example, the "RAD info" of the "Title" item correspond to the following combo box: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=UtiliserInfosRad.gif)<br>Only the indices of "Shared info" are stored in the database. | [Item](../WDChamp/1013059.md) |
| ***Horizontal/Vertical gridlines*** | The horizontal and/or vertical gridlines can be displayed (or not) in a chart. | [Chart](../WDChamp/1013006.md) |
