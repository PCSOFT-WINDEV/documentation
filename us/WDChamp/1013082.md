## Default events
<a name="default_events_ELTTEXTE000229"></a>
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile manage the following events by default (order of appearance in the code editor):

| Event | Runtime condition |
| --- | --- |
| Declaration of global variables | Declaration code of global variables of supercontrol. All the types of variables are supported. They can be used in any event associated with the supercontrol or with one of the controls included in the supercontrol. |
| Initialization | Run when opening the window. |
| Request for refreshing the display | Allows you to group the update code of the fields of the superfield: contents of controls, state (visible, grayed out...), text to refresh, etc.<br><br>This event can receive parameters. Simply declare a procedure in the event. For example: <br><br><br><pre><code>// Demande de mise à jour de l'affichage <br>PROCEDURE DemandeMiseAjour(TypeMiseAJour est un booléen)</code></pre><br><br><br>This event is started upon request by the following functions: <br><br>- [RequestRefreshUI](../WDLang1/1000023899.md) or [RequestRefreshUIParent](../WDLang1/1000023900.md): Executes the event at the end of the current event (asynchronous execution). <br><br>- [ExecuteRefreshUI](../WDLang1/1000023901.md) or [ExecuteRefreshUIParent](../WDLang1/1000023902.md): Executes the event immediately. <br><br><br>When these functions are called, you can specify the value of the parameters expected by the event. |
| Entry | Run when the cursor enters a control that is included in the supercontrol |
| Exit | Run when the cursor exits from one of the controls that is included in the supercontrol |
| Set the Value property | Executed at each assignment of the Property ***Value*** on the superfield (direct assignment or performed with the Property [Value](../Proprietes/2510130.md)). This code allows for example to retrieve parameters passed to the superfield. |
| Get the Value property | Executed each time the ***Value*** property of the internal window is retrieved. This code allows for example the superfield to return a value to the window hosting the superfield. |
| With each modification | This code is not run by default. To run it, use [ExecuteProcess](../WDLang1/3013031.md) associated with the *trtChange* constant. |

<a name="associating_local_procedure_with_supercontrol_ELTTEXTE000259"></a>
To create a procedure local to the supercontrol: 

1. Display the supercontrol description.

2. Click the "Add" button found below the "Local procedures" control. A new procedure is created.

3. Click the "Code" button to edit the procedure code.




**Tip**: To create local procedures linked to the supercontrol, you can perform the following operations:

1. Select your window (or page) and the supercontrol in the "Project explorer" pane.

2. Click the black arrow found beside the supercontrol name in the project explorer. The local procedures appear. 

3. Select "Local procedures". The local procedures displayed are the ones of supercontrol. You have the ability to add, rename or delete local procedures in the supercontrol.

Several optional events can be managed.

To add an optional event:

1. Select the desired control.

2. Display the code window of this control (F2 key).

3. Click the link "Add other events to xxx" at the bottom of the window code, after the last event.  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Traitements_optionnels_WD_OK%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)


4. All the optional events available for the control are displayed. 

5. Check the optional event to add and validate. 
	Remark: You can select several optional events. 

6. The selected optional event is automatically added to the events managed by the control.




To disable an optional event, simply perform the same operations to display the list of optional events. Then simply uncheck the optional events to delete. 
Remark: If the disabled code contains WLanguage code, this code is automatically deleted.

You can manage, for example:

- the mouse hover over the control,

- left mouse button down, up, double click,

- right mouse button down, up, double click, 

- the mouse wheel, etc.
