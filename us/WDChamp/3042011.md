## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000227"></a>
The data is interpreted as "column" whose height is proportional to the value of data.

The column charts are used to represent the data trend over a given time period. They are also used to perform comparisons between elements.

The categories are organized horizontally and the values are organized vertically in order to highlight their variation in time.

**Remark**: An horizontal Column chart is also available.

In this chart:

**1. Values of data.** 
This parameter is displayed if "Show values" is checked in the "Details" tab of the Chart control description.

**2. Title of vertical axis**. 
This parameter is displayed if the axis title was defined in the "General" tab of the Chart control description. This parameter can also be defined through programming with [grAxisTitle](../WDLang3/3042057.md). A title can also be defined for the horizontal axis.

**3. Mark on the vertical axis**. 
The mark is automatically calculated by default. The "General" tab of the control description is used to:

- define a specific mark.

- define a scale on the X-axis according to the time. This option operates with Date or DateTime data coming from a Table control or from an HFSQL item. This option cannot be used with a series filled through programming.

- define a logarithmic scale on the Y axis.

- specify the orientation of marks.




You also have the ability to use the secondary scale for one or more series ("Series" tab).

**4. Chart title**. 
The characteristics of the chart title can be defined in the "Details" tab of the control description ("Edit chart title").

You can define the chart title, its position and style.

**5. Legend**. 
The characteristics of the legend can be defined in the "Details" tab of the control description ("Edit chart legend").

You can define its position and its style.

**6. Labels of series**. 
The caption of the legend corresponds to the caption of the different series displayed in the chart (defined in the "Series" tab).

**7. Color of series**. 
A color can be defined for each series in the "Series" tab of the control description. An automatic color is used by default.

**8. Category label**. 
The category labels can be defined in the "Series" tab of the control description.

**9. Spacing between the columns of column chart**. 
This spacing is defined in the "General" tab of the control description.

**10. Gridlines**. 
The horizontal and vertical gridlines can be defined in the "General" tab of the control description.

### Additional characteristics
<a name="additional_characteristics_ELTPARAGRAPHE000125"></a>

- ***Layout of columns in the column chart***: the columns in the column chart can be grouped, stacked or in depth ("General" tab of the control description). The stacked column charts do not support the negative values.

- During a display in 3 dimensions, you can use ***cylindrical columns***.

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) A ***zoom*** (horizontal and/or vertical) can be applied in a Column chart. In this case, a zoom can be performed in the chart by the user to view a data.

- You also have the ability to display ***an image in chart background***. This image can be selected in the "Details" tab of the control description.

- You can use an ***image for the columns found in the column chart*** ("Series" tab in the chart description window).

- You can define ***a specific color for the border of columns*** found in the column charts:

	1. Make sure that the border color is not automatic ("Automatic border colors" option in the "Details" tab of the control description).

	2. In the "Style" tab, select the "Border color" element and select the requested color.




- The "Style" tab is used to configure the style of several elements: color of gridlines and axes, font for the title and axes, ...

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) The "Column" charts can be displayed with an animation. To animate this type of chart, simply check "Enable animations" in the "Details" tab of the control description. 

- **Stacked Column chart**: By default, a tooltip displays the value of each series. 
	You have the ability to display the total of the stack in addition to the total of each series by using [grTooltip](../WDLang3/3042010.md). Example:  
	
	```wl
	grTooltip(MySelf, grTooltipFormatCrosshairHeader, "[%CATEGORY%], Sum = [%VALUE%]")
	```


- **Data aggregation**: 

	- For the charts without time scale, the aggregation is not enabled by default.

	- For the charts with time scale, the default aggregation is the sum of columns.




- The aggregation algorithm can be defined by [grColumnAggregation](../WDLang3/1000023015.md). 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) "Column" charts can be displayed in real time. For more details, see [Real-time chart](../WDChamp/1000021037.md).
