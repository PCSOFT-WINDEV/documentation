## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000141"></a>
The report editor allows you to create "Spreadsheet" reports. 

In this case, the report contains a Spreadsheet control only. 

Remark: This type of control is created when creating a Spreadsheet report and can also be created independently of this report.

To create a "Spreadsheet" report: 

1. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_nouveau.gif) in the quick access buttons. 

	- The creation window appears: click "Report" then "Report". 

	- The report creation wizard starts. 




2. Select a "Spreadsheet" report. 

3. In the rest of the wizard, specify:

	- the data source of the Spreadsheet control created in the report. This source can be: 

		- a data file item,

		- a Spreadsheet control in a window. 

		- none, if Spreadsheet control is assigned through programming. 




- scaling options for the Spreadsheet control in the report: 

	- No scaling: The worksheet is printed with its dimensions. The print can be performed on several pages in width and in height if necessary. 

	- Adjust the calculation sheet to the control dimensions: The worksheet will be reduced in order to be entirely displayed in the Spreadsheet control. 

	- Adjust all the columns to the control width: The columns found in the worksheet will be reduced or enlarged in order for all the columns to be displayed in the control width. 

	- Adjust all the rows to the control height: The rows found in the worksheet will be reduced or enlarged in order for all the rows to be displayed in the control height.

## Characteristics of a Spreadsheet report and a Spreadsheet control
<a name="characteristics_spreadsheet_report_and_spreadsheet_control_ELTTEXTE000189"></a>
You can modify the following characteristics of a Spreadsheet report: 

- By default, the Spreadsheet report is not linked to a data source. The Spreadsheet report data source can be modified in the "Data" tab of the report description window ("Report description" in the report popup menu). 

- The "General" tab of the Spreadsheet control description window allows you to specify the scaling characteristics of the Spreadsheet control. 

- The "Content" tab of the Spreadsheet control description window allows you to link the Spreadsheet control to a data source: 

	- Memo item of a data file or query, etc, ... 

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Spreadsheet control in a window. 

	- [xlsDocument](../WDLang5/1000017464.md) variable. 




- The "Style" tab of the Spreadsheet control description window allows you to specify the style of the grid and header text displayed in the Spreadsheet control.

<a name="handling_spreadsheet_control_report_through_programming_ELTTEXTE000213"></a>
You can associate the Spreadsheet of a report with: 

- a variable of type [xlsDocument](../WDLang5/1000017464.md). Simply use the code: 
	
	```txt
	<Spreadsheet control> = <xlsDocument variable>
	```


- an xls/xlsx file. Simply use the code: 
	
	```txt
	<Spreadsheet control> = <Path of xls/xlsx file>
	```





Caution: Spreadsheet control management functions cannot be used on the Spreadsheet control of a report.
