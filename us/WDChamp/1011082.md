## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000285"></a>
You can use a report based on a TreeView Table control to directly print the information displayed in a TreeView Table control found:

- in a window or page of the application. This window or page must be displayed when printing the report.

- in an internal window or an internal page: 

	- The window displaying the internal window must be displayed.

	- The page displaying the internal page must be displayed.







A report based on a TreeView Table control can print:

- all the rows displayed in the TreeView Table control.

- the rows selected by the user (for the multi-selection TreeView Table controls where the rows are selected with the Ctrl key). This option is not available in WEBDEV.

- the entire hierarchy. 

- the hierarchy visible in the TreeView Table control. 




**Remark**: Only a Treeview Table report can be created on a Treeview Table control.

## Creating a report based on a TreeView Table control from the report editor
<a name="creating_report_based_treeview_table_control_from_the_report_editor_ELTTEXTE000309"></a>
The report editor allows you to create a TreeView Table report based on a TreeView Table control. Each row and each column found in the TreeView Table control are displayed in the TreeView Table report. 

Once the report is created, the print must be programmed in WLanguage. For more details, see [Printing a report based on a TreeView Table control](#NOTE4_1).|   |   |   |

| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ER.png)<br> | Important | [**Reports & Queries**](../Presentation/3088004.md) does not allow you to create reports based on a TreeView Table control. However, you can customize the reports based on a TreeView Table control created in the standard report editor (color, fonts, size, etc.). |

### Creating a report based on a TreeView Table control from the report editor
<a name="creating_report_based_treeview_table_control_from_the_report_editor_ELTPARAGRAPHE000046"></a>

To create a report based on a TreeView Table control from the report editor: 

1. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_nouveau.gif)
 in the quick access buttons. 

	- The new element window appears: click "Report" then "Report". 

	- The report creation wizard starts.




2. Choose a "TreeView Table" report. 

3. Select "From a TreeView Table control" and go to the next step. 

4. Specify: 

	- the TreeView Table control on which the report will be based. Only the TreeView Table controls in the windows or pages of the current project are proposed.

	- whether only the selected rows must be printed or whether all the control rows must be printed. 




5. Select the items (columns of TreeView Table control) to print and their position (associated block). 

6. Specify whether calculations must be performed on the numeric items.

7. Specify the format of sheet on which the report will be printed. The report is printed in A4 format by default.

8. Select the skin template to use. 

9. Type the name and title of the report (name of ".WDE" file corresponding to the report). This name will be used to identify the report in your programs.
	![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) You also have the ability to specify whether the report can be modified by the end user in "Reports and Queries". 

10. Validate the report creation. 

11. The report editor automatically proposes to change the format of the report. 

12. Specify the mode for reducing the report size: 

	- Print the report on several pages. In this case, the end user will have to group the pages. For more details, see [Multi-page print](../WDChamp/1011065.md). 

	- Use the landscape mode. 

	- Reduce the report size. Caution: according to the reduction percentage, the printed report may become unreadable. 




13. The report currently created is displayed in the report editor.

## Characteristics of the report based on a TreeView Table control
<a name="characteristics_the_report_based_treeview_table_control_ELTTEXTE000357"></a>
A report based on a TreeView Table control is similar to a report based on a Table control, but with additional characteristics. 

The report includes a table. For more details, see: 

- [Describing a report table](../WDChamp/1013051.md). 

- [Handling the cells of report table](../WDChamp/1013049.md). 




In the report description, information specific to this type of report can be configured in the "Data" tab: 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) **Printed rows**: Like for the Table control, you have the ability to specify whether only the selected rows or all the control rows must be printed.

- **Printing the hierarchy**: You have the ability to specify whether only the hierarchy displayed in the control must be printed or whether the entire hierarchy must be printed.

### Report test
<a name="report_test_ELTPARAGRAPHE000111"></a>

You cannot test a report based on a TreeView Table control from the report editor because the window or the page containing the TreeView Table control must be open. To test a report based on a Treeview Table control:

- create (if necessary) a button in the window or in the page of TreeView Table control. This button can be used to print the report with the data from the TreeView Table control [iPrintReport](../WDLang5/3046032.md)). 
	Case of internal windows or internal pages: If the TreeView Table control is found in an internal window or in an internal page, the button should be created in the internal window/page (and not in the host window/page).

- run the test of the window containing the TreeView Table control then run the report test (via the button).
	Case of internal windows: the test must be run from the window that is hosting the internal window.

- run the test of the page containing the TreeView Table control then run the test of the report (via the button).
	Case of internal pages: the test must be run from the page that hosts the internal page.

### Printing a report based on a TreeView Table control
<a name="printing_report_based_treeview_table_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000134"></a>

A report based on a TreeView Table control must be printed from the window (or from the page) displaying the TreeView Table control to print. To do so:

1. Create a button in the window (or in the page) containing the TreeView Table control.

2. Configure the report print destination:

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) In WINDEV, with [iDestination](../WDLang5/3046074.md) (report viewer, print in an HTML file, etc.).

	- 
			For more details, see [Print modes of a report](../WDChamp/1011031.md).


 For more details, see [Print modes of a report](../WDChamp/1011031.md).

3. Specify the name of the report to print with [iPrintReport](../WDLang5/3046032.md).




**Remarks**:

- If additional parameters must be passed to the report, these parameters must be specified in [iPrintReport](../WDLang5/3046032.md), after the name of the report to print. For more details, see [Report with parameters](../WDChamp/1011008.md).

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) If the window that contains the source TreeView Table control is opened multiple times (modeless opening with [OpenChild](../WDLang1/3038021.md)), the full name of the control to be printed must be passed as a parameter to the report. For example: 
	
	```wl
	// The FullName property will contain the name of the window
	// that must be opened with an alias to distinguish between each window
	iPrintReport(RPT_Customer_TVTable, TVT_Customer.FullName)
	```

	```wl
	// Opening code of the report: 
	PROCEDURE RPT_Customer_TVTable(sNameSourceTVTable)
	MyReport.SourceName = NameSourceTVTable
	```


- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) The [SelectionOnly](../Proprietes/2511017.md) property is used to get and change the records that will be printed in the report: print all records or the selected records only.

- The [KeepVisibleHierarchy](../Proprietes/1000021055.md) property is used to get and modify the print mode of the hierarchy: printing the entire hierarchy or printing the hierarchy that is visible in the control.

### WINDEV example
<a name="windev_example_ELTPARAGRAPHE000215"></a>

The information to print is in the Treeview Table control named "TVT_CustomerTable" found in the "WIN_Customer" window.

The report to print is named "RPT_TVTable_Customer" and it is printed when clicking the "BTN_Print" button.

In this example, the click code of "BTN_Print" button is as follows: 


```wl
// Open report viewer
iDestination(iViewer)
// Print the report based on the "TVT_CustomerTable" control 
iPrintReport(RPT_TVTable_Customer)
```
