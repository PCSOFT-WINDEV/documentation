The **iconic fonts** are used to improve the presentation of a title, caption or text. Indeed, images (icons) can be included in the text of an HTML caption.

All the WEBDEV controls that include a caption have a caption in HTML format by default: static, button, ... This static uses an integrated HTML editor. This HTML editor is used to customize the text (font, size, color, etc.) via the options of "Text" pane found in the ribbon: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Gestion_des_polices_icones%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)
The integrated HTML editor also includes a button allowing you to add an icon into the text.
