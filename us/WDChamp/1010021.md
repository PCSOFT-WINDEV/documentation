## Default events
<a name="default_events_ELTTEXTE000477"></a>
WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile manage the following events by default (order of appearance in the code editor):


| Event | Runtime condition |
| --- | --- |
| Global declarations | Declaration of variables global to the window. This is the first code run when opening the window. |
| End of initialization | Run when the window is opened.<br>The events are run in the following order:<br><br>- Initialization of the window controls (\*)<br><br>- Initialization of the window<br><br>- Focus gain<br><br><br>**Remark**: A blinking effect may appear if the code for updating the controls is included in this event. Indeed, the initialization code of controls is run before the update code. |
| Closing | Executed when closing the window.<br>**Remarks**: <br><br>- Resuming the input in one of the window controls in this code prevents from closing the window.<br><br>- If the window contains a "Cancel" Button, only the click code of this button is executed when the window is closed. <br><br><br> |
| Request for refreshing the display | Used to group the code for updating the window controls: content of controls, state (visible, grayed, etc.), caption to refresh, etc.<br><br>This event can receive parameters. Simply declare a procedure in the event. For example: <br><br><br><pre><code>// Request for refreshing the display <br>PROCEDURE AskForRefresh(RefreshType is Boolean)</code></pre><br><br><br>This event is started upon request by the following functions: <br><br>- [RequestRefreshUI](../WDLang1/1000023899.md) or [RequestRefreshUIParent](../WDLang1/1000023900.md): Executes the event at the end of the current event (asynchronous execution). <br><br>- [ExecuteRefreshUI](../WDLang1/1000023901.md) or [ExecuteRefreshUIParent](../WDLang1/1000023902.md): Executes the event immediately. <br><br><br>When these functions are called, you can specify the value of the parameters expected by the event. |
| ![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) Change of orientation | Run when the user turns the screen around. This allows you to reposition the controls when changing the orientation of the screen. |
| Closing a child window of the window | Run when closing a child window opened from the current window.<br><br>You can:<br><br>- use the [Name](../Proprietes/2510082.md) property to get the name of the child window that was closed.<br><br>- use the [ReturnedValue](../Proprietes/2510134.md) property to get the return value of the child window.Example:<br><br><br><br><br><br><pre><code>// -- Close a child window of WIN_OrderList<br>// Refreshes the list of orders if necessary<br>IF MyChildWindow.ReturnedValue = True THEN<br>	OrderList()<br>END</code></pre><br>The [MyChildWindow](../Motscles/1511021.md) keyword is used to manipulate the child window. |
|   | Used to update the widget content. This event is run:<br><br>- when opening a Widget window.<br><br>- at regular time interval. This interval is defined in the "Details" tab of the description window.<br><br><br>Remark: [WidgetDisplay](../WDLang3/1000020647.md) redisplays the widget and runs the refresh event. |


(\*) By default, the "Initializing" event of each control is executed according to the order in which the controls were created in the window. To modify this order of execution: 

1. On the "Window" tab, in the "Order" group, click "Initialization". 

2. In the window that appears, use the arrows on the right to change the order in which the controls are initialized.




**Caution**: If one or more controls use the persistence of controls, the "Whenever modified" code can be run when initializing the control. For more details, see [Persistence of controls](../WDChamp/9000019.md).

## Optional events
<a name="optional_events_ELTTEXTE000501"></a>


### Overview
<a name="overview_ELTPARAGRAPHE000144"></a>Several optional events are supported.
To add an optional event:

1. Select the desired control.

2. Display the code window of this control (F2 key).

3. Click the link "Add other events to xxx" at the bottom of the window code, after the last event.  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Traitements_optionnels_WD_OK%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)


4. All the optional events available for the control are displayed. 

5. Check the optional event to add and validate. 
	Remark: You can select several optional events. 

6. The selected optional event is automatically added to the events managed by the control.




To disable an optional event, simply perform the same operations to display the list of optional events. Then simply uncheck the optional events to delete. 
Remark: If the disabled code contains WLanguage code, this code is automatically deleted.You can manage the following aspects, for example:

- [Allow closing](#NOTE2_2aa). 

- [Resizing](#NOTE2_2a). 

- [Focus gain](#NOTE2_2b). 

- [Focus loss](#NOTE2_2c).

- [Modification of controls in the window](#NOTE2_2e).

- [Bringing the window to the front](#NOTE2_2).

- [Sending the window to the background](#NOTE2_3). 

- [Change of layout](#NOTE2_4).

- [Application of the light/dark theme](#NOTE2_5).

- [Start scrolling](#NOTE2_6).

- [While scrolling](#NOTE2_7).

- [Stop scrolling](#NOTE2_8).

### Optional event: Allow closing
<a name="optional_event_allow_closing_ELTPARAGRAPHE000200"></a>

This event can be used to make a verification when the window is closed, right before the "Closing" event is executed. 

This event can be used to: 

- request a confirmation, 

- prevent the window from closing. To do so, simply write the following line of code: 
	
	```wl
	RESULT False
	```





**Caution**: 

- if the window contains a "Cancel" Button, only the click code of this button is executed when the window is closed. 

- the "Allow closing" event is executed only when the window is closed via the "X" button. This event is not executed when [Close](../WDLang1/3038018.md) is called.





<a name="NOTE2_2a"></a>
