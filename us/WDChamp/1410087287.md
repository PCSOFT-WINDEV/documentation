### Direction of the controls
<a name="direction_the_controls_ELTPARAGRAPHE000016"></a>

The first value is **Direction (flex-direction)**. This value defines the direction in which the controls inside the Flexbox container will be laid out. This positioning also depends on the order in which the controls are displayed. The available options are: 

- undefined: by default, corresponds to "row". 

- row: controls are laid out horizontally, from left to right. 

- column: controls are laid out vertically, from top to bottom. 

- row-reverse: controls are laid out horizontally, from right to left. 

- column-reverse: controls are laid out vertically, from bottom to top. 




You may have to define different values, depending on the desired direction. 

For a "row" direction, you will need to define the following values:

- Line wrap (flex-wrap)

- Horizontal alignment (justify-content)

- Global vertical alignment (align-content)

- Vertical alignment on each row (align-items)


And in the case of a "column" direction, you will need to define the following values: 

- Line wrap (flex-wrap)

- Vertical alignment (justify-content)

- Global horizontal alignment (align-content)

- Horizontal alignment on each column (align-items)

- **Line wrap (flex-wrap)**: 
	Defines the position of the controls in the Flexbox container. Controls are laid out horizontally, from left to right. If there is no more horizontal space, the other controls are positioned on the line below. This mode takes into account the width of each control and the width of the Flexbox container. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Flexbox_Detail_ligne%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif&type=thumb)
The available options are: 

	- undefined: Default value. Corresponds to "no-wrap". 

	- nowrap: Controls are laid out in a single line. The Flexbox control stretches horizontally or a scrollbar is displayed.

	- wrap: Controls that do not fit in the line are positioned on the next line.

	- wrap-reverse: Controls that do not fit in the line are positioned on the next line from bottom to top.




- **Horizontal alignment (justify-content)**:

	- flex-start: The first control is aligned to the left. The other controls are laid out from left to right.

	- flex-end: The last control is aligned to the right. The other controls are laid out from right to left. 

	- space-between: Controls are laid out horizontally, from left to right. The first control is aligned to the left. The last control is aligned to the right. the other controls are distributed in the remaining space and the same spacing value is used between the controls.

	- space-around: Controls are laid out horizontally, from left to right. Controls are distributed with equal space around them, taking into account both the other controls and the right and left edges of the Flexbox container.




- **Global vertical alignment (align-content):**:

	- flex-end: Controls in the last line (N) are aligned to the bottom edge of the Flexbox container. Controls in the second to last line (N-1) are aligned to the top edge of the controls in the last line (N). Etc.

	- space-between: Controls in the first line are aligned to the top edge of the Flexbox container. Controls in the last line (N) are aligned to the bottom edge of the Flexbox container. Controls in the inner lines are aligned and distributed at equal distance from the controls in the first and last line.

	- space-around: Controls in each line are distributed vertically from top to bottom. Controls in each line are distributed with equal space around them, taking into account both the other controls and the top and bottom edges of the Flexbox container.

	- stretch: Controls will stretch horizontally and vertically to take up the remaining space in the Flexbox container. This is the default value ("undefined").




- **Vertical alignment on each row (align-items)**: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Flexbox_Detail_ligne%20-%20HC%20N%B0004.gif&type=thumb)
