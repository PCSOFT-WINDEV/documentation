## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000405"></a>
To view the characteristics of the control, select "Description" in the context menu. There are two types of information:

- information about the entire Looper control (select the name of the Looper control).

- information about each attribute of the looper (select the name of the looper attribute). In this case, only the "Binding" tab is available. 




In WEBDEV, different operating modes are available: 

- **Standard looper**.   

- **Ajax looper**. 
	Remark: This type of looper is used to avoid refreshing the page at each server action. It is also used to get an interface closer to the one of a Windows application, by proposing scrollbars instead pagers. 

- **Browser looper**. 
	Remark: This type of looper can be handled programmatically in browser code. It can operate in stand-alone mode, without accessing the server. This type of looper is recommended in off-line mode or in WebApp sites. It can also be used in static sites.




WEBDEV also includes different display modes: 

- Grid view: This mode displays the different controls of the Looper in a grid view. 

- Gallery in rows: This display mode creates an image gallery in rows.  

- Gallery in columns: This display mode creates an image gallery in columns.  




The different tabs in the Looper control description window allow you to define: 

- the operating mode ("General" tab).

- the initial state of the control and the selection mode ("UI" tab).

- the display mode and its settings ("Details" tab). 

- the population mode and the [breaks](../WDChamp/1013287.md) ("Content" tab). 

- the style of the different looper elements ("Style" tab).

### Operating mode
<a name="operating_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000057"></a>

The different operating modes are: 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Caract_ZR_WB_Zoninig%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif&type=thumb)


- **Standard looper**. 
	In standard mode, the entire page is refreshed each time an action is performed on the server. 
	This operating mode includes an optional pager (to move between the different pages of data displayed by the control). 
	This operating mode is compatible with any display mode: grid view, gallery in rows or gallery in columns. 

- **Ajax looper**. 
	This type of looper is used to avoid refreshing the page at each server action. It is also used to get an interface closer to the one of a Windows application, by proposing scrollbars instead pagers.
	This operating mode is compatible with a grid view. 

- **Browser looper**. 
	This type of looper can be handled programmatically in browser code. It can operate in stand-alone mode, without accessing the server. 
	This type of looper is recommended in off-line mode or in WebApp sites. It can also be used in static sites. 
	This operating mode is compatible with a grid view.  





### Maximum number of rows per page
<a name="maximum_number_rows_per_page_ELTPARAGRAPHE000083"></a>

This option is used to specify the maximum number of rows allowed on the page. 

**If the number of rows in the Looper control is greater than this value**: 

- for a standard Looper control, an associated Pager control can be used to view additional rows. 

- for an Ajax Looper control, a scrollbar appears and allows users to view the additional rows. 




**If the number of rows in the Looper control is less than this value**: 

- for a standard Looper control in a page that doesn't use zoning mode, space is kept for the rows. 

- for a standard Looper control in a page that uses zoning mode and with anchors set to fit to the content, space is not kept for the rows. The controls below the Looper control automatically snap to it. 

- for an Ajax Looper control, space is kept for the rows. 




This option is available for standard and Ajax Looper controls. 

Remarks: 

- The maximum number of rows per page can be dynamically changed using the [NbLinesPerPage](../Proprietes/2510081.md) property. 

- If the number of rows in a new Looper control based on a data file is greater than the maximum number specified, a pager is automatically associated with the control. The pager makes it possible to view all the records in the Looper control.



<a name="NOTE2_2_Version23"></a>


### Context menu
<a name="context_menu_ELTPARAGRAPHE000111"></a>

A context menu can be displayed for a Looper control. This context menu will allow the user to export the content of the Looper control to Word, Excel, OpenOffice, XML, etc.

To enable this context menu, check "With export context menu". You can also choose the image that will be used for the context menu. We recommend that you use an image with the following dimensions: 15 x 15 pixels.

The context menu is available only for standard and Ajax Looper controls. 
<a name="NOTE2_3_Version23"></a>


### Direct access to the properties of the controls (without using attributes)
<a name="direct_access_the_properties_the_controls_without_using_attributes_ELTPARAGRAPHE000126"></a>

This option is used to dynamically change the properties of the controls in the looper without declaring attributes. 

For example, the following syntax can be used to change the background color of a Static control in a Looper control: 

```wl
ZR_MaZone[nLigne].LIB_MonLibellé.CouleurFond = MaCouleur
```

<a name="NOTE3_1_Version23"></a>


### Display mode: Grid view
<a name="display_mode_grid_view_ELTPARAGRAPHE000140"></a>

There are multiple modes available if the Looper control displays the data in a grid view: 

- **In Zoning mode**: 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Caract_ZR_WB_Zoninig%20-%20HC%20N%B0004.gif&type=thumb)


	- ***Fixed number of columns/Fill by rows***. 
			All you have to do is specify the number of columns to display. The looper will be populated horizontally until it reaches the specified number of columns and then starts in a new row. The number of columns does not change when the user changes the page width.
			This display mode is available for standard, Ajax and Browser loopers. 

- ***Variable number of columns/Fill by rows***. 
			The number of columns depends on the page width. The number of columns increases or decreases when the user changes the page width.
			You can define the minimum number of columns.
			This display mode is available for standard and Browser loopers.  

- ***Fixed number of columns/Fill by columns***. 
			Specify the number of columns to display (greater than 1). The looper will be populated vertically until it reaches the specified number of rows and then starts a new column. The number of columns does not change when the user changes the page width.
			This display mode is available for standard loopers. 

- **In Responsive Web Design mode**: 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Caract_ZR_WB_RWD%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif&type=thumb)


	- ***Variable width of columns***. 
			All you have to do is specify the number of columns to display. The looper will be populated horizontally until it reaches the specified number of columns and then starts in a new row. The number of columns does not change when the user changes the page width.
			This display mode is available for standard, Ajax and Browser loopers.

- ***Fixed width of columns***. 
			The number of columns depends on the page width. The number of columns increases or decreases when the user changes the page width.
			The minimum number of columns must be specified. The ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Caract_ZR_WB_RWD%20-%20HC%20N%B0005.gif)
 icon indicates that this value is specific to each slice. Therefore, this value must be modified for each slice in the page. 
			Click the icon to directly define the values for each slice in the following window: ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Caract_ZR_WB_RWD%20-%20HC%20N%B0007.gif)

			This display mode is available for standard loopers.

- ***Number of columns per slice***. In a page in Responsive Web Design mode, the number of columns can change according to the slice. Each slice has a different width.
			This display mode is only available for standard loopers.
			This allows you to adapt the number of columns according to the slice width (i.e. according to the browser size). 
			When this option is selected, an icon appears to the right of the specified number of columns: ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Caract_ZR_WB_RWD%20-%20HC%20N%B0006.gif)
. This icon indicates that this value is specific to each slice. Therefore, this value must be modified for each slice in the page. 
			Click the icon to directly define the values for each slice in the following window: ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Caract_ZR_WB_RWD%20-%20HC%20N%B0007.gif)

### Display mode: Gallery in rows
<a name="display_mode_gallery_rows_ELTPARAGRAPHE000204"></a>

If the Looper control shows the data as a gallery in rows, you can define several options: 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Caract_ZR_WB_Zoninig%20-%20HC%20N%B0005.gif&type=thumb)


- **Reference control for the height**: Allows you to define the control in the Looper control that will be used as reference for the width of the images displayed in the row. This control can be an Image or Thumbnail control. If the source image is smaller than the dimensions defined in the editor, the dimensions of the reference control will be applied to the image at runtime. 

- **During click, open a popup for automatic scroll**: Automatically opens a popup to scroll through the different elements in the gallery. This popup contains: 

	- the elements in the row.  

	- a "Close" button and the Next and Previous arrows. These elements can be set via the "Style" tab of the Looper control description window ("Left button", "Right button" and "Close button" elements). 




- **Animate during reorganization of cells when resizing**: Applies an effect when the browser is resized and the rows are reorganized. The duration of this animation can be specified. This value can be modified using the [AnimationDuration](../Proprietes/1000021069.md) property.

## Content of a Looper control handled programmatically
<a name="content_looper_control_handled_programmatically_ELTTEXTE000507"></a>
<a name="NOTE4_1_Version28"></a>


### Infinite looper
<a name="infinite_looper_ELTPARAGRAPHE000286"></a>

One mode of filling an Looper control may be an "as needed" fill: only the data visible to the user is loaded in memory. The additional data is loaded on demand (when using the scrollbar for example). 
**Benefit**: Low memory usage, less loading time and lower bandwidth consumption. 
**Drawback**: No sorting or searching until all data is available.

For more details, see [Infinite Table and Looper controls](../WDChamp/1013307.md). 


### Contents of each row of the Looper control different
<a name="contents_each_row_the_looper_control_different_ELTPARAGRAPHE000302"></a>

The Looper controls allow you to customize the appearance of rows: Page setting, content, etc.. It is thus possible, for example, to nest repeated zones in repeated zones. 

To create a Looper control with variable content: 

1. Create a Looper control populated programmatically. This control must be a vertical Looper control containing a single column. 

2. Open the Looper control description window. 

3. In the "Contents" tab of the description of the control, check the "Use an internal page per row (LooperAddIP function)" option.. 

4. Validate the control description window. 

5. Create the different internal pages for the rows of the Looper control. 

6. Add the internal pages to the Looper control using the following functions: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [LooperAddIP](../WDLang2/1410089366.md) | Adds a row as an internal page at the end of a Looper control populated programmatically. |
| [LooperInsertIP](../WDLang2/1410089367.md) | Inserts a row as an internal page into a Looper control populated programmatically. |
| [LooperModifyIP](../WDLang2/1410089368.md) | Modifies a row corresponding to an internal page in a Looper control populated programmatically. |




**Characteristics of internal pages**
The following rules apply to the width and height of internal pages: 

- Height: The height of the row that contains an internal page corresponds exactly to the height of the internal page defined in edit mode. The internal page cannot be higher than the Looper control. 

- Width: 

	- If the width of the internal page is less than the width of the Looper control, the internal page is automatically increased and anchors are applied. 

	- If the width of the internal page exceeds the width of the Looper control, the internal page is automatically truncated. 


 As a general rule, it is recommended to create the internal page with the smallest possible width and to use anchors. 




Remark: If the internal page includes controls adapted to content, the row height will be increased or reduced according to the content.

## Control style ("Style" tab)
<a name="control_style_style_tab_ELTTEXTE000560"></a>
<a name="NOTE4_1_Version23"></a>


### "Border/Background" element: Border thickness
<a name="borderbackground_element_border_thickness_ELTPARAGRAPHE000342"></a>

Depending on the browser used, the thickness of the borders of the different rows in the looper may be different.

For example, if the border thickness is less than 3 pixels, this characteristic:

- will not be applied properly in Internet Explorer.

- will be applied properly in Firefox.



<a name="NOTE4_2_Version23"></a>


### Left button, Right button and Close button
<a name="left_button_right_button_and_close_button_ELTPARAGRAPHE000354"></a>

The "Left button", "Right button" and "Close button" elements are used to customize the elements in the popup window displaying the image when scrolling through the images automatically (image gallery in rows or in columns).
