## Interacting with a Web Component control

### Prodecures associated with the Web Component control
<a name="prodecures_associated_with_the_web_component_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000019"></a>

Several methods can be used to interact with a Web Component control. 

For example, you have the ability to create Server and/or Browser procedures linked to the Web Component control ("Details" tab of control description). 

These procedures can be used to modify the data found in the Web Component control by assigning a value coming from the WEBDEV page for example. 

The Web Component control can directly call these procedures from the HTML code of Web component. The HTML code editor proposes the different available procedures via the completion on the actions. 

For example, the following HTML code is used to call the "Action" code of the component during the click on the "Order" button: 

```html
<button onclick="CMP_Test()" class="w3-aqua">
	Order
</button>
```


The HTML code editor proposes the different available procedures and actions: ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CompoWeb_code.gif)


You also have the ability to call the procedures of the Web Component control from the WEBDEV controls directly. 




### Processes for assigning and retrieving the Value property

The processes for assigning and retrieving the Value properly are mainly used to initialize the value of the Web component during page load and to retrieve its value.
