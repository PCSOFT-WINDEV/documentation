## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000095"></a>
In Table controls (based on a data file or populated programmatically), columns with a search icon open a context menu with the sort, filter and search characteristics available for the column. 

Simply right-click the search icon to open the context menu of the column: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Table_menuTriColonne.gif)


This context menu proposes:

- to perform a search ("Find" option): 
	All you have to do is type the first letters corresponding to the sought element. The Table control displays all the elements corresponding to the first letters typed. 

- to implement a filter ("Filter"): 
	To do so, select a condition and type the requested value. The content of the Table control is filtered according to the specified condition.
	Remark: The "Is empty" condition is used to display only empty elements in the column. 

- to delete a filter that was previously set on the column ("Delete filter"). 

- to remember filters ("Remember filters").
	If this option is enabled, the filters implemented when closing the window will be automatically run during the next window opening. A short message will be displayed to inform the user and to indicate the filters that are set. 

- to remember sorts ("Remember sorts").
	If this option is enabled, the sorts defined when the window is closed will be automatically set next time the window is opened. 

- to set a filter with one of the values in the column.




**Remarks**: 

- The context menus displayed when you right-click the column title and the search icon are different. 

- These options are also available for the TreeView Table controls. 

- For more details on the options of this context menu, see [Context menu of columns](../WDChamp/9500125.md).
