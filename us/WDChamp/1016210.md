## Overview

The Drawer control can contain other controls and it is intended to make UI design easier. It can be expanded in order to display (or not) the integrated controls. The collapse/expand operation of control can be done:

- by clicking the control title,

- through programming.

<a name="creating_drawer_control_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000026"></a>

To create a "Drawer" control in a window: 

1. On the "Creation" tab, in the "Containers" group, expand "Tab and associated" and select "Drawer control".

2. Click at the desired location to create the control. The control appears in the editor. 
	The created Drawer control automatically contains a control: this control is the button used to "Expand/Collapse" the Drawer control. This control contains the necessary WLanguage code. You have the ability to customize this control by associating it with a specific image.

3. Drop on the Drawer control the different controls that must appear/disappear when it is used.


To view the characteristics of the control, select "Description" in the context menu.

### Drawer control found in a window
<a name="drawer_control_found_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000086"></a>

- When the Drawer control is in edit in the window editor, it can be handled like when it is in execution. The popup menu of the control allows you to expand/collapse it upon request ("Collapse/Expand the Drawer control" option).

- In the description of the Drawer control, the "General" tab is used to specify:

	- Whether an animation must be performed when handling a Drawer control.

	- Whether the window size must be adapted when using the control. Indeed, when the Drawer control is expanded, the controls found below the Drawer control are automatically moved to the bottom. This option is used to automatically enlarge the window to the bottom in order to see the controls found below the Drawer control.
