## Principle
<a name="principle_ELTTEXTE000126"></a>
<a name="Nested_Printing"></a>
To create a main report containing several secondary reports: 

1. Set the printing destination of the main report using [iDestination](../WDLang5/3046074.md).

2. Specify the name of the main report to print with [iPrintReport](../WDLang5/3046032.md).




**Remarks**:

- If additional parameters must be passed to the main report, these parameters must be specified in [iPrintReport](../WDLang5/3046032.md), after the name of the report. For more details, see [Report with parameters](../WDChamp/1011008.md).

- [iListNestedReports](../WDLang5/3046005.md) returns the list of secondary reports nested in a main report.

- To print reports with different orientations (portrait/landscape), we recommend that you use the sequencing of reports. This method can be easily implemented. For more details, see [Sequencing reports](../WDChamp/9000128.md).

## Example
<a name="example_ELTTEXTE000150"></a>


### Example to perform
<a name="example_perform_ELTPARAGRAPHE000047"></a>

The "RPT_OrderReport" report includes a main report and a secondary report.

The "RPT_OrderReport" report is printed when the "Print" Button control is clicked on.


### Corresponding code
<a name="corresponding_code_ELTPARAGRAPHE000054"></a>In this example, the click code of "Print" Button control is as follows:
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) WINDEV code:


```wl
// Open report viewer
iDestination(iViewer)
// Print the RPT_OrderReport report
iPrintReport(RPT_OrderReport)
```

## WLanguage functions specific to the nested reports
<a name="wlanguage_functions_specific_the_nested_reports_ELTTEXTE000180"></a>
The following functions are used to manage the nested reports: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [iListNestedReports](../WDLang5/3046005.md) | Returns: <br><br>- the list of nested reports currently printed (reports run by [iPrintReport](../WDLang5/3046032.md) in one of the processes of the report currently printed). <br><br>- the list of sequenced reports currently printed ([iSequenceAdd](../WDLang5/1000020059.md)).<br><br><br> |
| [iNestedHeaderFooter](../WDLang5/3046047.md) | Prints (or not) the page headers and footers of nested report. |
