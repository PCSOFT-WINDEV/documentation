## Overview of the Tab control
<a name="overview_the_tab_control_ELTTEXTE000224"></a>
The Tab control is used to simultaneously display different controls. When a tab pane is enabled:

- the controls associated with the tab pane are displayed in the window or page.

- the controls associated with another tab pane are not shown, 

- the controls that are not associated with any tab pane keep the same state.

## Creating a Tab control
<a name="creating_tab_control_ELTTEXTE000248"></a>
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png)![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) To create a Tab control:

1. On the "Creation" tab, in the "Containers" group, expand "Tab and associated" and select "Tab".

2. Click at the desired location to create the control. The control appears in the editor.




Remark: The dimensions of the control are optimized to take up the available space at the specified position. If the control size does not suit you, press Ctrl + Z: the control size will be reset to default.

To view the characteristics of the control, select "Description" in the context menu. 

The description window of the control is used to: 

- configure the tabs (text, icon, etc.). 

- [name the tabs](../WDChamp/1013196.md). 

- select [the display mode of the tabs](../WDChamp/1013274.md). 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) use [dynamic tabs](../WDChamp/1013299.md).

| Name | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Tab | Tab button used to switch the active view to the corresponding pane. The tab can contain an image or a text. This text can be composed of several lines separated by CR. |
| Tab pane | Area that contains the controls associated with the tab. |
| ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Dynamic tab | ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Tab displaying an internal window. Used to create a web browser-like interface:<br><br>- tabs can be "detached" from the main window.<br><br>- tabs can be reorganized.<br><br>- it is possible to close and open tabs.<br><br><br>For more details, see [Dynamic tabs](../WDChamp/1013299.md). |
| ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Static tab | ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Standard tab, as opposed to dynamic tabs. |
