## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000155"></a>
A report (and a duplicate copy) can include an additional text in the format of a watermark, such as "Confidential" or "Duplicate" printed across the report. 

The watermark can be created: 

- from the report viewer (WINDEV only).

- programmatically. 




**Remarks**: 

- If a watermark is defined for a report, it is defined for all the pages of the report.  

- A single watermark can be defined for each report. You cannot define several watermarks. 

- The watermark is printed on the pages containing information only. It is not printed on empty pages.

## Creating a watermark from the report viewer

<a name="NOTE2_1"></a>
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) On the "Annotate" tab of the report viewer, the "Watermark" option allows the user to create a watermark in the report being displayed.

When this option is selected, a specific window allows the user to define:

- the destination of the watermark: print and/or duplicate copy. 

- the positioning of the watermark: ascending diagonal, descending diagonal or horizontal. 

- the text of the watermark, its font, its size, its color and its opacity. ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Fen_Filigrane.gif)

## Creating a watermark through programming
<a name="creating_watermark_through_programming_ELTTEXTE000203"></a>
<a name="NOTE3_1"></a>
Different methods can be used to create a watermark through programming: 

- [Method 1: Full configuration: using a Watermark variable](#NOTE3_2). 

- [Method 2: Quick configuration: direct use](#NOTE3_3).

### Method 1: Full configuration: using a Watermark variable
<a name="method_1_full_configuration_using_watermark_variable_ELTPARAGRAPHE000063"></a>

This method is as follows: 

1. Define a [Watermark](../WDLang5/1000019922.md) variable. This variable contains all the characteristics of the watermark to print. 

2. Use [iParameterWatermark](../WDLang5/1000019939.md) to add the watermark into your report. 

3. Start printing the report. 




For example: 

- WLanguage code used to print a watermark in the background of a report created with the report editor:
	
	```wl
	// Print a watermark in report background
	MyWatermark is Watermark
	
	// Text of the watermark
	MyWatermark.Text = "Confidential"
	// Font used
	MyWatermark.Font.Name = "Arial"
	// The watermark will be horizontally centered at bottom
	MyWatermark.Position = iCenterH + iBottom
	
	// Print in the report viewer
	iDestination(iViewer)
	
	// Indicates that the watermark will be printed during the print 
	// and in the duplicate copies
	iParameterWatermark(iWatermarkPrinting + ...
		iWatermarkDuplicate, MyWatermark)
	
	// Starts printing the report
	iPrintReport(RPT_Commercial)
	```


- WLanguage code used to print a watermark in the background of a report created with the print functions:
	
	```wl
	MyWatermark is Watermark
	
	// Text of the watermark
	MyWatermark.Text = "Confidential"
	
	// Print in the report viewer
	iDestination(iViewer)
	
	// Implement a watermark in document background only
	iParameterWatermark(iwatermarkPrinting, MyWatermark)
	
	// Prints several pages with watermark
	FOR i = 6 TO 10
		iPrint(" Page " + i)
		iSkipPage()
	END
	// The last page is empty and it has no watermark
	
	// Ends the print job
	iEndPrinting()
	```

### Method 2: Quick configuration: direct use
<a name="method_2_quick_configuration_direct_use_ELTPARAGRAPHE000089"></a>

This method is as follows: 

1. Use [iParameterWatermark](../WDLang5/1000019939.md) to specify the text of the watermark that will be added into your report. In this case, the "Arial" font is used, with an automatic size and with an opacity set to 20%. 

2. Start printing the report. 




For example: 

- WLanguage code used to print a watermark in the background of a report created with the report editor: 
	
	```wl
	// Print in the report viewer
	iDestination(iViewer)
	
	// Indicates that the watermark will be printed during the print 
	// and in the duplicate copies
	iParameterWatermark("Confidential")
	
	// Starts printing the report
	iPrintReport(RPT_Commercial)
	```


- WLanguage code used to print a watermark in the background of a report created with the print functions:
	
	```wl
	// Print in the report viewer
	iDestination(iViewer)
	
	// Implement a watermark in document background only
	iParameterWatermark(iWatermarkPrinting, "Confidential")
	
	// Prints several pages with watermark
	FOR i = 6 TO 10
		iPrint(" Page " + i)
		iSkipPage()
	END
	// The last page is empty and it has no watermark
	
	// Ends the print job
	iEndPrinting()
	```
