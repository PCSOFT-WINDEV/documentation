<a name="creating_spreadsheet_control_window_ELTTEXTE000303"></a>


### Creating the control
<a name="creating_the_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000011"></a>

To create a Spreadsheet control: 

1. On the "Creation" tab, in the "Graphic controls" group, expand "Office" and select "Spreadsheet".

2. Click at the desired location to create the control.




Remark: The dimensions of the control are optimized to take up the available space at the specified position. If the control size does not suit you, press Ctrl + Z: the control size will be reset to default.

To view the characteristics of the control, select "Description" in the context menu.


### Remarks
<a name="remarks_ELTPARAGRAPHE000035"></a>

- The data displayed by a Spreadsheet control can: 

	- be defined through programming.

	- be entered in the window editor. 

	- come from a variable. This variable must be a buffer variable and it must et contain the Excel worksheet.

	- come from a data file or query. In this case, the item linked to the control can correspond to a memo item containing the desired Excel worksheet. 




- A specific AAF menu is automatically associated with the Spreadsheet control. For more details, see [Automatic Application Features (AAF) of Spreadsheet control](../WDChamp/1000033006.md). 

- The maximum values of Spreadsheet control are: 

	- 16384 columns.

	- 1048576 rows.

	- 4096 worksheets.

### Spreadsheet control description window
<a name="spreadsheet_control_description_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000066"></a>

The main options of the Spreadsheet control can be defined in the "Details" tab of the control description window. 

These options are as follows: 

- Input options: 

	- **Allow the input of values**: The end user will be able to enter values in the cells of Spreadsheet control. This option can be modified in the code using the [InputValue](../Proprietes/1000021336.md) property. 

	- **Allow the input of formulas**: The end user will be able to enter formulas in the cells of Spreadsheet control. This option can be modified in the code using the [InputFormula](../Proprietes/1000021337.md) property. 




- Display options: 

	- **Display headers of rows and columns** (3): The names of the cells are displayed in the Spreadsheet control (letters for the columns, digits for the rows). This option can be modified in the code using the [HeaderVisible](../Proprietes/1000021335.md) property. 

	- **With formula input bar** (2): A calculation bar is displayed at the top of control. This bar is used to type formulas. This option can be modified in the code using the [FormulaBarVisible](../Proprietes/1000021334.md) property. 

	- **Toolbar** (1): Used to display a toolbar at the top of control. This toolbar is used to format the selected cells. You have the ability to display: 

		- No bar. 

		- A toolbar (compatibility with version 22): Displays the menu in toolbar format. This option can be modified in the code using the [ToolbarVisible](../Proprietes/1000021333.md) property. This toolbar can be customized (see [Customizing the toolbar](#NOTE3_1)). 

		- A ribbon (by default for a control created from version 23). This ribbon can be customized (see [Customizing the ribbon](#NOTE3_3)). 




- Other parameters: 

	- **Row height**: Used to set the height of a row in the worksheet. The "Margins" button allows you to set the cell margins, if necessary. 

	- **Allow multiple worksheets** (4): This option is used to manage several worksheets in the Spreadsheet control. The tabs for managing the worksheets are displayed at the bottom left of Spreadsheet control. A popup menu allows the user to manage the worksheets. This option can be modified by the [MultiWorksheet](../Proprietes/1000021639.md) property.

## Customizing a Spreadsheet control
<a name="customizing_spreadsheet_control_ELTTEXTE000373"></a>


### Customizing the toolbar
<a name="customizing_the_toolbar_ELTPARAGRAPHE000164"></a>

To customize the toolbar of Spreadsheet control, you must use specific internal windows. 

To customize the toolbar: 

1. On the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, expand "Import" and select "WINDEV elements and their dependencies". 

2. Select the "Programs\\Data\\Preset windows\\AAF" directory.

3. Select the windows: 

	- WinDevAaf_SelBorderPSHEET.wdw: Window used to select the border options for the cells found in the Spreadsheet control. 

	- WinDevAaf_ColorSel.wdw: Window used to select the color of the font. 

	- IW_WinDevAaf_BarPSHEET.wdw: Window corresponding to the toolbar. 




4. Validate. 

5. Customize the "IW_WinDevAaf_BarPSHEET.wdw" window according to your needs.
	Caution: the names of the controls must not be modified. 




If the Spreadsheet control uses a toolbar ("With toolbar" option in the "Details" tab of the control description or [ToolbarVisible](../Proprietes/1000021333.md)), the custom toolbar will be used. 
<a name="NOTE3_2"></a>


### Customizing the formula bar
<a name="customizing_the_formula_bar_ELTPARAGRAPHE000202"></a>

To customize the formula bar, simply re-create it. 

To create a custom formula bar: 

1. Create two controls: 

	- A Static control for example, used to view the coordinates of selected cell (or range of cells). 

	- An edit control used to type the formula. 




2. Create two buttons: 

	- A button used to validate the input of formula. 

	- A button used to cancel the input of formula. 




3. Through programming: 

	- Indicate the role of the first two controls (viewing the coordinates or typing the formula) via [SpreadsheetControlFormula](../WDLang1/1000021647.md). For example: 
			
		```wl
		// -- Initialization code of Spreadsheet control
		// Removes the default formula bar
		PSHEET_MySpreadsheet.FormulaBarVisible = False
		// Defines the control used to view 
		// the coordinates of selected cell in the Spreadsheet control
		SpreadsheetControlFormula(PSHEET_MySpreadsheet, psheetfSelection, STC_Selection)
		// Defines the control used to enter the formulas in the Spreadsheet control
		SpreadsheetControlFormula(PSHEET_MySpreadsheet, psheetfFormula, EDT_Formula)
		```


	- Define the actions of these two buttons with [AAFExecute](../WDLang1/1000022099.md). For example:
		```wl
		// -- Click code of button used to validate the formula
		// Use of AAFExecute
		AAFExecute(PSHEET_MySpreadsheet, aafValidateInputFunc)
		```

		```wl
		// -- Click code of button used to cancel the formula
		// Use of AAFExecute
		AAFExecute(PSHEET_MySpreadsheet, aafCancelInputFunc)
		```








**Caution**: To use a custom formula bar, the default formula bar must be disabled: 

- in the editor: "With formula input bar" option in the "Details" tab of the control description. 

- through programming: [FormulaBarVisible](../Proprietes/1000021334.md) property.

### Customizing the ribbon
<a name="customizing_the_ribbon_ELTPARAGRAPHE000243"></a>

To customize the ribbon of Spreadsheet control, you must use specific internal windows. 

To customize the ribbon: 

1. Go to the "Details" tab in the Spreadsheet control description window. 

2. In  the "Toolbar" area, make sure that the "Ribbon" option is selected. . 

3. In  the "IW source of ribbon" area, select the default preset window. 

4. The "IW_WinDevAAF_SpreadsheetBar" window is automatically included in your project. This internal window (available in English and French) can be modified according to your needs. This window contains the code required to manage the Spreadsheet control. It is recommended to check for UI errors and make sure the window works properly after any change is made. 




Remark: You also have the ability to use an internal window to propose specific ribbon. Any internal window of your project can be used to create this bar.
