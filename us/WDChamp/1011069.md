## Quick overview

WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile allow you to create reports with the report editor. The reports can be created with the data coming from:

- a data file found in an analysis or any data file,

- a query result,

- a view on an HFSQL data file,

- a Table control found in a window or in a page,

- a TreeView Table control found in a window or in a page,

- an Organizer or Scheduler control found in a window,

- a text file,

- a variable (variable global to the project or variable used in the current report), 

- ...




The report editor can also be used to create customizable blank reports.

The method for creating a report is straightforward. A wizard helps you create the report. At the end of the description, the report corresponding to your choices is generated. The report can be run:

- from the editor directly.

- from a site or from an application.




You can modify the layout of the report, add, modify or delete controls. You can also perform specific processes in WLanguage (the programming language of WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile).

**The report editor is easy to use**. It proposes several features:

- **Choosing the destination of report execution**: 
	You can print in a file in  PDF, HTML, XML, XLS, RTF or PCL format. 
	In WEBDEV, this file is saved in a directory accessible in write mode on the server. Then, this file can be displayed on the browser.
	In WINDEV, the report can be previewed before it is printed and it can be printed from the preview. 
	In WINDEV Mobile, the report destination depends on the platform: 
	- in iOS applications, the report can only be saved as a PDF.
	- In Android applications, the report can only be saved as a PDF.
	- in UWP applications, the report can only be saved as a PDF.

- **Choosing the items to print**: 
	You can choose the items that will be printed (no need to print all of them)

- **Ability to print the data of several data files**: 
	The report can contain items coming from several data files. To simplify the data selection, the queries allow you to easily select the data to print.

- **Ability to print the data coming from variables**: 
	The report can contain items linked to variables found in the project (global variables) or in the report (local variables). These variables can be simple variables, members of classes, members of structures or members of advanced variables.

- **Selecting records**: 
	One or more criteria can be defined to select the records that will be printed. Powerful queries allow you to create reports corresponding to complex selection conditions.

- **Sorting records**: 
	You can select the sort conditions according to which records will be displayed. You can even define a break on the sort arguments.

- **Printing labels**: 
	You can create and print custom labels

- **Custom calculations**: 
	You can add custom calculations to your report (VAT, ...)

- **Totals and counters**: 
	You can add totals and counters on the controls (calculated controls or controls linked to items). These totals and counters can be general, intermediate, by break, ...

- **Images, borders, background colors**: 
	You can improve the report layout by adding charts, images, borders and background colors.

- **Choosing fonts**: 
	The controls found in your report can have different fonts, different colors, ...

- **Configuring the page headers and footers**: 
	 Various information (date, page number, total number of pages, ...) can be displayed in the page headers and footers. Different page headers and page footers can be defined in a report (even page footer and odd page footer for example).

- **Printing grouped reports**: 
	Several methods can be used to print several reports in the same output (in the same PDF file for example): 

	- the nesting of reports, 

	- the internal reports, 

	- the composite reports, 

	- the sequence of reports.




- **Choosing the number of columns**: 
	The data found in your report can be printed in several columns.

<a name="standard_report_editor_ELTPARAGRAPHE000139"></a>

The standard query editor allows you to create reports and to run these reports from the editor or from an application developed with WINDEV, WINDEV Mobile or WEBDEV.

The **dongle** of the product used is required to use the report editor. It must be plugged into the parallel port of your computer when using the editor.
No dongle is required by the end users to run a report from a WINDEV, WINDEV Mobile or WEBDEV application.

Several **examples** are supplied with the standard report editor. These examples describe the main reports that can be used in your applications (invoice, list, labels, ...).
