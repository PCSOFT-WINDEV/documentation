	From version <B>18</B>, the framesets are available for backward compatibility with the former sites. However, they are not supported in HTML 5 and they are not recommended for the referencing and/or for the navigation from mobile devices. <br>We advise you to replace the framesets by pages that share page templates and/or control templates.

## How to?
<a name="how_ELTTEXTE000104"></a>
To validate a page other than the current page (which means found in a different frame):

1. Create a button (or a link) in the page containing the information to validate (page containing the table in the example). This button (or this link) can be invisible. Only the server click code of this button will be run.

2. In the code of the button (or link) used to validate the page ("Validate the corrections" link in the example), call [PageSubmit](../WDLang2/3058020.md) and specify:

	- the name of the page to validate (page containing the table in the example).

	- the name of the button (or link) used to validate the page (control created in step 1).

	- the destination (the name of the frame) where the result of the validation must be displayed.
