## Overview

WINDEV allows you to handle an ActiveX control in WLanguage via:

- properties and methods

- events

## Properties and methods of the ActiveX
<a name="properties_and_methods_the_activex_ELTTEXTE000135"></a>
An ActiveX is associated with properties and methods. These properties and methods can be used in WLanguage to handle the ActiveX control directly. To do so, use the Automation syntax of WLanguage.

For example:


```wl
// AVIReader is an ActiveX control
AVIReader>>Zoom=12 // Assign a property
AVIReader>>Pause(10) // Call a method
```

<a name="NOTE2_2"></a>
To find out the properties and methods associated with an ActiveX, you can:

- see the documentation of the ActiveX control.

- use [WDXVIEW](../WDXView/3526002.md) supplied with WINDEV.

- use the automatic completion of WINDEV. The properties and methods of the ActiveX are automatically proposed by the code editor. For example, for the "Microsoft WEB Browser" ActiveX, we get:

## Events associated with the ActiveX
<a name="events_associated_with_the_activex_ELTTEXTE000165"></a>
WLanguage allows you to manage the events generated by an ActiveX control with [ActiveXEvent](../WDLang1/3025010.md). This function allows you to associate a procedure of your project with the requested event.

For example:


```wl
// Initialization code of the ActiveX control named AVIReader
ActiveXEvent("My_procedure","AVIReader","OnClick")
// "my procedure" will be called whenever the 
// "OnClick" will be triggered by the "AVIReader" control.
```


To find out the events associated with an ActiveX, you can:

- see the documentation of the ActiveX control.

- use [WDXVIEW](../WDXView/3526002.md) supplied with WINDEV.
