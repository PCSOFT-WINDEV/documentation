**Remark**: By default, the print mode of the report is automatically requested during the test of each report. 

**To avoid displaying this window during the report test**, simply check "Do not show again".

In this case, the report tested will be directly displayed in the report viewer.

Remark: You can show this window again. For more details, see [Do not show a message again](../Editeurs/2020011.md).

<a name="printer_ELTPARAGRAPHE000050"></a>

The report is directly printed on the default printer of the current computer, with the default options of the printer. 
<a name="NOTE2_3"></a>


### RTF file
<a name="rtf_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000057"></a>

The report is saved and viewed in RTF (Rich Text Format). The created file is viewed in one of the text editors installed on the current computer (Word, Open Office or NotePad for example). 
The generated file is named "&lt;ReportName&gt;.RTF". This file is created in the EXE subdirectory of the project directory.

Remarks:

- A text editor must be installed on the current computer in order to view the generated file.

- To save a file in RTF, the "RICHED20.DLL" file must be found on the current computer. In most cases, the "RICHED20.DLL" file is in the Windows system directory.

- Printing texts that are not oriented horizontally (90° for example) is not supported.

- The tables are supported by RTF. The font color and the background color of cells are stored.

- Overlaying elements (images and texts for example) is not supported.
