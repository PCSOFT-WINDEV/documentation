## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000096"></a>
The site map path is used to implement the structure and the sequence of pages in your site. The site map path is used:

- by the [Breadcrumb](../WDChamp/1013265.md) control.

- by the [Site Map](../WDChamp/1013300.md) control.

## Building the site map path
<a name="building_the_site_map_path_ELTTEXTE000120"></a>
The implementation of a site map path is required as soon as a control used to navigate in the site is implemented (site map path or site map).

You can:

- **Build the site map path automatically** from the sequences performed in your site ("Automatic creation" button). If a site map path already exists, it will be deleted. WEBDEV uses the sequence of pages described in the editor or by programming to build the site map.

- **Build the navigation map manually**: to do so, select the pages to display and add them to the site map path with the "Add" button. You can now organize the sequence of pages by performing "Drag and Drop" operations between the different pages in the "Site Map Path" area.

- **Add or remove pages** from the navigation map ("Add" and "Remove" buttons).

- ** Display and modify the description of each page** found in the site map path: to do so, double-click the page found in the "Site map path" area. You can define:

	- the caption used in the site map path or in the site map ("Caption" tab). The page title is used by default.

	- the tooltip associated with the page and displayed when the site map path or the site map is hovered by the mouse cursor ("Tooltip" tab). The page title is used by default.

	- the value of parameters that will be used to display the page ("Parameters" tab). This option is very useful for the AWP pages for example.







This operation must be performed for each page.

**Remark**: The links found in the site map path that use URLs with parameters will be automatically taken into account in the [SiteMaps file](../Editeurs/2030053.md).
