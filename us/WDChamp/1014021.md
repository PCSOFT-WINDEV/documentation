## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000256"></a>
WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile propose to use a "Relative duration" display mask for the Date controls. This mask is used to display the duration between the data found in the control and today's date in natural language: yesterday, tomorrow, one week ago, in one month, ...



This "RelativeDuration" mask is also available in programming via [DateToString](../WDLang1/3027025.md). 

The caption used by the "Relative duration" mask can be configured for each language used by the application.

**To configure the caption used**:  

1. On the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, click "Description".

2. In the "Languages" tab:

	- select the language to configure.

	- select the "Date" tab.




3. Click "Dates and Times in natural language...".

4. Define the custom captions to use.

## Relative duration: modifying the available captions
<a name="relative_duration_modifying_the_available_captions_ELTTEXTE000280"></a>
A default caption is indicated for each specified period. This caption is used as soon as the "Relative duration" mask is used. 

The default mask can be modified for each period: to do so, enter the new mask in the "Custom caption" column. 


### Format of masks to use
<a name="format_masks_use_ELTPARAGRAPHE000070"></a>

The format of the masks can contain two types of information:

- A standard date: to do so, the following elements allow you to define a custom mask: 
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| 'DDDD' | Corresponding day of the week, "Thursday" for  example. The case used depends on the linguistic options of the project. |
| 'Dddd' | Corresponding day of the week with the first letter forced in uppercase, for example: Monday. |
| 'dddd' | Corresponding day of the week with the first letter forced in lowercase, for example: Monday. |
| 'DDD' | Abbreviated day of the week, "Fri" for example |
| 'Ddd' | Abbreviated day of the week with the first letter forced inn uppercase, for example: Mon |
| 'ddd' | Abbreviated day of the week with the first letter forced inn lowercase, for example: Mon |
| 'DD' | Date in digits, "25" for example |
| 'MMMM' | Month in full, "January" for example. The case used depends on the linguistic options of the project. |
| 'Mmmm' | Month in full with the first letter forced in uppercase, for example: January. |
| 'mmmm' | Month in full with the first letter forced in lowercase, for example: January. |
| 'MMM' | Abbreviation of the month, "Jan" for example. |
| 'Mmm' | Abbreviation of the month with the first letter forced in uppercase, for example: Jan. |
| 'mmm' | Abbreviation of the month with the first letter forced in lowercase, for example: jan. |
| 'MM' | Month in digits, "06" for example |
| 'YYYY' | Year on four digits, "2001" for example |
| 'AA' | Two last digits of the year, "01" for example |
| 'HH' | Hour in digits, "13" for example |
| 'mm' | Minutes in digits, "32" for example |
| 'SS' | Seconds in digits, "46" for example |



- An amount of time elapsed between the current date and time and the given date and time. The following masks are used for this format:
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| RYY | Returns the number of years passed |
| RMM | Returns the number of months passed |
| RWW | Returns the number of weeks passed |
| RDD | Returns the number of days passed. |
| RHH | Returns the number of hours passed. |
| Rmm | Returns the number of minutes passed. |
| RSS | Returns the number of seconds passed |




Caution: For accuracy reasons, only two nearest formats will be accepted. The other formats are not modified.

The possible information couples are:

- Years / Months

- Months / Weeks

- Weeks / Days

- Days / Hours

- Hours / Minutes

- Minutes / Seconds




Specifying 2 types of information increases the accuracy of the values.

**If a single information is specified**, the difference years/months/weeks/days are defined according to the calendar:

- Two years are passed between 12/31/2012 and 01/01/2014.

- Two months are passed between 12/31/2012 and 02/01/2013.

- Two days are passed between 10/10/2012 at 23:59 and 10/12/2012 at 00:00.




**If two types of information are specified**, the years/months/weeks/days are defined more precisely:

- A year is equivalent to a full year, which means from MM/DD/YYYY to MM/DD/YYYY+1

- A month is equivalent to a full month, which means from DD/MM to DD/MM+1

- A week is equivalent to 7 days, which means from DD at HH:mm:SS at DD+7 at HH:mm:SS

- A day is equivalent to a full day, which means from DD at HH:mm:SS to DD+1 at HH:mm:SS
