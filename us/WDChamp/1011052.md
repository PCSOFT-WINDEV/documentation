## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000624"></a>
A report based on a data file is used to print the records coming from a single data file (HFSQL Classic or Client/Server, accessed via a Native Access, ...). If the records come from several files, we recommend that you use a [report based on a query](../WDChamp/1011013.md).





**Characteristics of a report based on a data file**
<a name="Report_Bound"></a>
The characteristics of a report based on data file are as follows:

- **Search key**: a report based on a data file uses a **search key**. This key is used to browse the records that will be printed in the report. This key is defined in the data file. 

- **Bounded report**: a report based on a data file can be **bounded**. These bounds are used to define the range of records that will be printed in the report. For more details, see [Bounded report based on a data file](#NOTE3_1).


A report based on a data file can be created via the report creation wizard. This type of report can be created only if the current project is associated with an analysis.

Once the report based on the data file has been created, you can:

- modify the data source of the report ("Data" tab in the report description).

- modify the search key ("Data" tab in the report description).

- define the bounds ("Data" tab in the report description).

- add or delete Item controls linked to the data file associated with the report.

## Creating a report based on a data file
<a name="creating_report_based_data_file_ELTTEXTE000672"></a>
To create a report based on a data file:

1. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_nouveau.gif) in the quick access buttons. 

	- The creation window appears: click "Report" then "Report". 

	- The report creation wizard starts.




2. Choose the layout of your report (table, form, label, ...). For more details, see [The different types of reports](../WDChamp/1011054.md).

3. Select (if necessary) the report template to use. A report template is used to comply with a specific page layout. For more details on report templates, see [Report templates](../WDChamp/9000105.md). 

4. Select the report data source: "from a data file or from an existing query" option.

5. Select the data file on which the report is based. The description of this data file must be in the analysis associated with the current project.

6. Select the search key of this report. This item will be used to browse the records of the selected data file. 
	For a bounded browse, specify the values of the bounds that will be given to the report. 

7. Select the sort items for the report. These items will be used to sort the data printed in the report. For more details on sorts, see [Sorts in a report](../WDChamp/1011035.md).

8. To group the records, you have the ability to create breaks on the sort items. To create breaks, answer "Yes" to the question "Do you want to add some breaks into the report?".
	The next step is used to select the sort items corresponding to the breaks. For more details on breaks, see [Breaks in a report](../WDChamp/1011028.md).

9. For each data file item displayed in the report:

	- type the corresponding caption. This caption will be displayed:

		- before the item. For example:<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=etatLibelleFiche.gif)


		- in the column header (for the Table reports). For example:<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=etatLibelleTable.gif)
This caption can be modified in the report editor.

- select the block where the control associated with the item will be printed. The positions of different controls can be modified in the report editor. For more details on the different blocks and their position in a report, see [Report blocks](../WDChamp/1011040.md).

10. Modify (if necessary) the display order of controls in the report with the arrow buttons found on the right of table.

11. If the data file associated with the report contains at least one numeric item, some calculations can be performed on these items. Specify the calculation performed for each item (sum, average, ...). Two types of calculations are available:

	- **general calculation**: a Calculated control will be created in the *End of document* block.

	- **calculation on break**: a Calculated control will be created in the *Break footer* block. In the calculations on break, the result of the calculation is reinitialized after each break. To perform a calculation on break, a break must be found in the report currently created.




12. Depending on the type of report currently created, indicate the specific options.
	

| Type of report | Specific options |
| --- | --- |
| Report based on a form | Form image, printing the form image, ...<br>Options presented in detail in [Report based on a form](../WDChamp/1011067.md) |
| Label report | Format of labels, number of identical copies, ...<br>Options presented in detail in [Label report](../WDChamp/1011050.md) |



13. Specify the format of sheet on which the report will be printed. The report is printed in A4 format by default.
	Remark: By default, the report controls are displayed in a single column. To create a multi-column report, simply specify the desired number of columns in the "Format" tab of the report description window. 

14. Select the skin template of the report if necessary.

15. Type the name and title of the report (name of ".WDE" file corresponding to the report). This name will be used to identify the report in your programs.
	![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) You can also specify whether the report can be modified by the end user in "Reports & Queries". 

16. Validate the report creation. 

17. The report editor automatically proposes to change the report format if the following conditions are fulfilled:

	- the report currently created includes a table.

	- the report format does not allow to display all table columns.




18. Specify (if necessary) the mode for reducing the report size: 

	- Print the report on several pages. In this case, the end user will have to group the pages. For more details, see [Multi-page print](../WDChamp/1011065.md). 

	- Use the landscape mode. 

	- Reduce the report size. Caution: according to the reduction percentage, the printed report may become unreadable. 




19. The report currently created is displayed in the report editor.

## Bounded report based on a data file
<a name="bounded_report_based_data_file_ELTTEXTE000696"></a>
A report based on a data file can be bounded on the search key used. For example, a report based on the "Customer" data file can print all the customers, or only the customers whose names start with "D" or "E" if the report is bounded.

A bounded report can be defined:

- when creating the report.

- in the report description directly ("Data" tab).



<a name="NOTE3_2"></a>


### Defining a bounded report
<a name="defining_bounded_report_ELTPARAGRAPHE000214"></a>

To define a bounded report:

1. Select:

	- "Minimum value provided" and/or "Maximum value provided" when creating the report.

	- "Lower bound" and/or "Upper bound" in the "Data" tab of the report description ("Report description" from the popup menu of the report).




2. Specify the lower bound and/or the upper bound when printing the report with [iPrintReport](../WDLang5/3046032.md), or with the [MinValue](../Proprietes/2510008.md) and [MaxValue](../Proprietes/2510009.md) properties. For more details, see [Printing a bounded report](#NOTE4_2).




**Remark**: When testing a bounded report (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Ico_Go_Fenetre_WD.gif) in the quick access buttons), a window allows you to enter the bounds of the report.

## Printing a report based on a data file
<a name="printing_report_based_data_file_ELTTEXTE000726"></a>
To print a report based on a data file, you must:

1. Configure the report print destination:

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) In WINDEV, with [iDestination](../WDLang5/3046074.md) (report viewer, print in an HTML file, etc.).


 For more details, see [Print modes of a report](../WDChamp/1011031.md).

2. Specify the name of the report to print with [iPrintReport](../WDLang5/3046032.md).




Additional parameters must be specified in the following cases:

- Printing a bounded report based on a data file.

- Printing a report with parameters based on a data file.

| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ER.png) | Important | In [Reports & Queries](../Presentation/3088004.md), you can print a report:<br><br>- by starting a print job (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Ico_Imprimer.gif)). <br><br>- by testing the report (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Ico_Go_Fenetre_WD.gif)). <br><br><br>Therefore, no programming is required to print the report. |



![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) **WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile examples**
The "RPT_Customer" report is based on the "Customer" data file. This report is used to print the characteristics of customers.

"RPT_Customer" is printed during when "BTN_Customer" is clicked on. In this example, the click code of "BTN_Customer" is as follows:

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) WINDEV code:
	
	```wl
	// Open the report viewer
	iDestination(iViewer)
	// Prints the RPT_Customer report
	iPrintReport(RPT_Customer)
	```



**Remark**: When used in the code of the report, the [SourceName](../Proprietes/2511035.md) property allows you get and change the name of the data file associated with the report.

1. Configure the report print destination:

	- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) In WINDEV, with [iDestination](../WDLang5/3046074.md) (report viewer, print in an HTML file, etc.).


 For more details, see [Print modes of a report](../WDChamp/1011031.md).

2. Specify the following parameters with [iPrintReport](../WDLang5/3046032.md):

	- the name of the report to print.

	- the value of the lower bound for the report.

	- the value of the upper bound for the report.







![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) **WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile example**

The "RPT_Customer" report is a bounded report based on the "Customer" data file. This report is used to print the characteristics of the customers whose name starts with the letter "D".

The lower bound corresponds to "D". The upper bound corresponds to "D"+hMaxVal.

"RPT_Customer" is printed during when "BTN_CustomerD" is clicked on.

In this example, the click code of "BTN_CustomerD" is as follows:

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) WINDEV code:
	
	```wl

	- the name of the report to print.

	- the parameters expected by the report (in the order specified in the report).







![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) **WINDEV example**

The "RPT_Param" report corresponds to a mailshot sent to the customers. This report expects as parameter:

- the text of this mailshot entered in the "EDT_MailshotText" edit control.

- the date for sending this mailshot entered in the "EDT_SendDate" edit control.




This report is printed when "BTN_Print" is clicked on. The "RPT_param" report is based on the "Customer" data file.

In this example:

- the click code of "BTN_Print" is as follows: 
	
	```wl
	// Open the report viewer
	iDestination(iViewer)
	// Print the report with parameters
	iPrintReport(RPT_Param, EDT_MailshotText, EDT_SendDate)
	```
