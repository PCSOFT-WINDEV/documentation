## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000065"></a>
In this example, the application allows you to:

- view the video sequence currently broadcasted by the camera installed on the current computer.

- modify the configuration of the driver for video capture.

- save the video currently broadcasted by the specified camera as an image (BMP file) or as a video sequence (AVI file).

## Use example
<a name="use_example_ELTTEXTE000095"></a>
To develop this application:

1. Create a blank window: 

	- Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_nouveau.gif) in the quick access buttons. 

	- The creation window appears: click "Window" then "Window". 

	- In the wizard, select "Blank". 




2. In this new window:

	- Create a Camera control named "CAM_Camera": on the "Creation" tab, "Graphic controls" group, expand "Video and capture" and click "Camera".
			Remark: By default, the camera associated with this control will correspond to the default camera found on the current computer.

	- Create a Button control and name it "BTN_Film": on the "Creation" tab, in the "Usual controls" group, click "Button".
			This Button control will be used to display the video sequence in the Camera control.

	- Create a Button control and name it "BTN_Configuration": on the "Creation" tab, in the "Usual controls" group, click "Button".
			This Button control will be used to modify the configuration of the driver for video capture.

	- Create a Button control and name it "BTN_Image": on the "Creation" tab, in the "Usual controls" group, click "Button".
			This Button control will be used to save the video sequence currently transmitted, as an image (BMP file).

	- Create a Button control and name it "BTN_Video": on the "Creation" tab, in the "Usual controls" group, click "Button".
			This Button control will be used to save the video sequence currently transmitted, as a video sequence (AVI file).

	- Create a Button control and name it "BTN_Stop": on the "Creation" tab, in the "Usual controls" group, click "Button".
			This Button control will be used to stop displaying and/or saving the video sequence in the Camera control.




3. Write the following code in the "Click" event of "BTN_Film":
	
	```wl
	// Displays the video sequence currently transmitted in the "CAM_Camera" control
	ResDisplay is boolean
	ResDisplay = CAM_Camera.Display()
	// Displays an error message if a problem occurs
	IF ResDisplay = False THEN Error(ErrorInfo())
	```


4. Write the following code in the "Click" event of "BTN_Configuration":
	
	```wl
	// Displays the standard dialog box used to 
	// configure the driver for video capture used by the "CAM_Camera" control
	CAM_Camera.Configure()
	```


5. Write the following code in the "Click" event of "BTN_Image": 
	
	```wl
	// Save the image currently broadcasted in the "CAM_Camera" control
	ResImgBck is boolean
	ResImgBck = CAM_Camera.Capture("Temp.bmp", viPictureCapture)
	IF ResImgBck = False THEN 
		Error(ErrorInfo())
	END
	
	// Select the file to create
	ImageFile is string 
	ImageFile = fSelect(fExeDir(), "Image", ...
		"Save as...", "BMP" + TAB + "*.BMP", "bmp", fselCreate + fselExist)
	
	// Renames the created BMP file
	IF ImageFile ~= "" THEN
		// Delete the temporary file
		fDelete("Temp.BMP")
	ELSE
		// Renames and moves the generated file
		fRename("Temp.BMP", ImageFile)
	END
	```


6. Write the following code in the "Click" event of "BTN_Video":
	
	```wl
	// Save the video sequence currently broadcasted 
	// in the "CAM_Camera" control in the format of a 3-minute AVI
	ResVideoBck is boolean
	ResVideoBck = CAM_Camera.Capture("Temp.avi", viVideoCapture, 180)
	IF ResVideoBck = False THEN 
		Error(ErrorInfo())
	END
	
	// Select the file to create
	VideoFile is string = fSelect(fExeDir(), "Video", ...
		"Save as...", "AVI" + TAB + "*.avi", "avi", fselCreate + fselExist)
	
	// Renames the created AVI file
	IF VideoFile ~= "" THEN
		// Delete the temporary file
		fDelete("Temp.avi")
	ELSE
		// Renames and moves the generated file
		fRename("Temp.avi", ImageFile)
	END
	```


7. Write the following code in the "Click" event of "BTN_Stop":
	
	```wl
	// Displays the display or the backup of the video sequence
	ResStop is boolean 
	ResStop = CAM_Camera.Stop()
	// Displays an error message if a problem occurs
	IF ResStop = False THEN Error(ErrorInfo())
	```
