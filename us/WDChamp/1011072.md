## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000133"></a>
When creating a report, the test of this report can be run from the report editor.

You also have the ability to include this report in your applications. The user will have the ability to print the report from a button or from a menu option for example.|   |   |   |

| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ER.png) | Important | If you are using Reports & Queries, you have the ability to print a report:<br><br>- by starting a print job (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Ico_Imprimer_cpt.gif)).<br><br>- by testing the report (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Ico_GO_Fenetre_WD_bl.gif)).<br><br><br>Therefore, no programming is required to print the report. <br><br>In order for the reports created in Reports & Queries to be directly printed from a WINDEV application, this feature must be implemented by the provider of the WINDEV application. <br><br>The provider can for example include a window allowing the end user:<br><br>- to select a report created with Reports & Queries.<br><br>- and to run this report.<br><br><br> |

## Principle for printing in WINDEV
<a name="principle_for_printing_windev_ELTTEXTE000175"></a>
Regardless of the type of report to print, the principle for printing a report is as follows:

1. Specify the print mode of the report (preview, direct print, HTML page generation, etc.) with [iPreview](../WDLang5/3046069.md) or [iDestination](../WDLang5/3046074.md)

2. Start the print job with [iPrintReport](../WDLang5/3046032.md).




This principle must be adapted according to the data source used in each report.

The following paragraphs show how to:

- [programmatically print a report based on a data file.](../WDChamp/1011052.md)

- [programmatically print a report based on a query.](../WDChamp/1011013.md)

- [programmatically print a report based on an HFSQL view](../WDChamp/1011064.md). 

- [programmatically print a report based on a memory area.](../WDChamp/1011061.md)

- [programmatically print a report based on a Table control.](../WDChamp/1011012.md)
