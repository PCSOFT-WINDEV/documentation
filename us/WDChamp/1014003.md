## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000146"></a>
WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile propose two types of masks:

- the ***input masks*** that define the characters that can be typed and/or displayed in the controls found in a window or in a page. Sometimes, these masks can also be used to modify the case (uppercase/lowercase characters) of the values assigned to the window controls or to the page controls by programming.

- the ***display masks*** that define the characters that can be printed in the controls found in a report.

### The different types of masks

Regardless of the type of mask, a mask can be:

- ***preset***. The editor proposes different types of masks according to the content of the control (text, numeric, ...).

- ***custom***. All you have to do is enter the mask to apply. For example, "CCC9 LL 9A" for a text control or "DDD DD MMMM YYYY" for a date control. A regular expression can also be defined with the [InputMask](../Proprietes/2510033.md) property. 
	

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) ***advanced***. Simply define the input mask using an [InputMask](../WDLang1/1000024886.md) variable. This type of variable allows a customized control on each event linked to input masks in an edit control.

- ***notfound***. No mask is associated with the control. No check is performed in this case.




For the Numeric, Currency, Date, Time and Duration controls, the mask can also be "***Defined by the project***". In this case, the linguistic characteristics defined in the "Language" tab of the project description are automatically taken into account according to the runtime language of the application.

The linguistic options selected by default are the ones of Windows.

For each type of numeric data, you have the ability to define the parameters that will be applied (decimal separator, thousand separator, currency symbol, time format, AM or PM symbol, ...).

**Remark**: This option allows you to automatically use the same configuration of the multilingual feature in all the numeric controls of the application. The management of the multilingual formats is centralized in the project description.

The input/display mask of a control can be set in the its description window ("General" or "Details" tab), or programmatically (using the [InputMask](../Proprietes/2510033.md) property).

### Multilingual masks
<a name="multilingual_masks_ELTPARAGRAPHE000067"></a>

For a multilingual project, a different mask can be selected for each language supported by the window (page or report). The corresponding mask will be used according to the runtime language of the project.

For more details, see [Multilingual feature in the controls of a window, page and report](../WDChamp/1013031.md).
