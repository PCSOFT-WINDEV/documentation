### Control in a window or page
<a name="control_window_page_ELTPARAGRAPHE000011"></a>

The Rating control allows the user to: 

- indicate the popularity level of an element via repeated pictograms. 

- find out the popularity level of an element via repeated pictograms. 




In most cases, this type of control presents the popularity level as a rating from 1 to 5 stars: ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Notation_Etoile.gif)

It can also be used to indicate a user choice: ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Notation_Jaime.gif)

WINDEV and WEBDEV give you the ability to: 

- use any number of pictograms.

- use any shape of pictogram. For example, you have the ability to use images from the image catalog.

## Characteristics of Rating control
<a name="characteristics_rating_control_ELTTEXTE000209"></a>
The "General" tab in the Rating control description window allows defining the characteristics of the control: 

- The **maximum possible mark**: is used to define the number of pictogram repetitions in the Rating control. This option is available in "Same image for each mark" mode only. 

- The **number of marks in the image**: indicates the number of pictograms found in the image. This option is available only if the layout of the image set uses the "Different image for each mark" mode. 

- The **initial mark**, which means the mark used when the control is displayed. 

- The **granularity of marks**. This option corresponds to the mode for selecting the marks. The rating can evolve: 

	- by integer value: the mark will evolve by 1 at a time

	- by half-value: the mark will evolve by 0,5 at a time. 

	- by real value: the mark will evolve according to the value typed by the user. 




- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) The **value of a 'star'**: value associated with a star (or any other symbol). The value of the Rating control will correspond to the value of a star multiplied by the number of stars displayed. 

- **The image of marks**: Image used to view the marks. If this parameter is not specified, the image of a star is used by default. The ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Menu_Image_Editeur%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif) button is used to select: 

- an image accessible from your computer ("Browse" option). 

- an image in the image catalog ("Catalog" option). In this case, the selected image is automatically adapted to the specified options.

- **Image set distribution**: used to define the mode for dividing the control image set: 

	- **Same image for each mark**: The image must contain a single pictogram (represented by several states). The repetition of the pictogram will be used to represent the different possible values in the control. 

	- **Different image for each mark**: The image must contain several pictograms (each one being represented by several states). Each pictogram will be used to represent the different possible values in the control. In this mode, the maximum mark corresponds to the number of pictograms contained in the image. 




- **Graphically differentiate marks below the current mark**: 

	- When this mode is disabled, the marks below the current mark are displayed like the current mark. 

	- When this mode is enabled, the marks below the current mark are drawn by using the state 0 of the image set (the marks below the current mark will be invisible if the image contains a single state).
