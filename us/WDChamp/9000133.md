## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000188"></a>
The wizard for creating iPhone windows allows you to easily create a window containing all main elements of a window for an iPhone application. 

These different elements can be added at any time into the window. 

You can also configure different options in the window description. 

At the end of the wizard, the window is created under the editor with the specified characteristics. In addition to the window, you can view the following elements in the editor: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Fen%EAtre_iphone_Editeur%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif&type=thumb)


- the system bar, 

- the areas that correspond to the portrait or landscape mode (represented by dashes), 

- the location of the home bar (from iPhone X). It is recommended not to place any clickable control (button, etc.) at this location.

Several options are available: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=IOS_Ass_Orientation.gif)
These options can be modified in the editor, in the "Details" tab of the description window ("Orientation"). 

You also have the ability to specify whether automatic scrollbars must be displayed. The scrollbars will be automatically displayed if the size of the window is greater than the resolution of the screen on the device used. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=IOS_FenDetail.gif)

You have the ability to create a window: 

- with **navigation bar**. This bar allows the user to close a window via a "Close" or "Back" button for example.
	To add a navigation bar to a window: on the "Window" tab, in the "Bars and menus" group, expand "Other bars", click "For compatibility", and then select "Manual navigation bar (iOS Navigation Bar").

- with a **looper or a multiline zone**. This type of window is used to select an option, configure one or multiple options, etc.

- with a **Tab bar**. In most cases, a "Tab bar" is used to access the different windows of the application.
	To add a tab bar into a window: on the "Window" tab, in the "Bars and menus" group, expand "Other bars", click "For compatibility", and then select "Manual tab bar (iOS Tab Bar").

- with a **toolbar**. In most cases, the toolbar is used to perform actions on the current window. 
	To add a toolbar to a window: on the "Window" tab, in the "Bars and menus" group, expand "Other bars", click "For compatibility", and then select "Manual toolbar (iOS ToolBar").




**Difference between a tab bar and a toolbar**: 

- A toolbar proposes actions on the current view.

- A tab bar corresponds to tabs.

If you have chosen to create a window with looper or with multiline zone, the different wizard planes allow you to configure this element. 

- Several types of preset loopers or multiline zones are available: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=IOS_Ass_TypeZR.gif)<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=IOS_ass_typeZM.gif)


- The following plane is used to configure the elements displayed in the looper or in the multiline zone. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=IOS_ass_ParamZR.gif)


- For a looper, you have the ability to choose how the looper will be filled (programming, file link, variable link).




When the wizard is validated, the selected looper or multiline zone is automatically created in the window. 

You have the ability to type the code used to handle it and to make it operate. 

**For a looper**, the main WLanguage events to be modified are as follows:

- Initialization code of the Looper control: this event is used, for example, to fill the looper. 

- Row selection code: this event is used to manage the actions performed when the user clicks the standard arrow. 

- Click code of IMG_Disclosure image: this event is used to manage the click on the custom bullet.
