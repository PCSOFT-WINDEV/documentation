## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000198"></a>
WINDEV allows you to easily insert automatic calculations into the columns found in the Table and TreeView Table controls. 

From version 22, you also have the ability to perform automatic calculations in the columns found in the Table and TreeView Table controls. These calculations are performed through programming.

## How to?
<a name="how_ELTTEXTE000222"></a>


### Implementation
<a name="implementation_ELTPARAGRAPHE000024"></a>

To add a custom calculation in the column of a Table control (or TreeView Table), use [TableFormulaAdd](../WDLang1/1000022361.md).

This function expects as parameter: 

- the name of the column taken into account for the calculation. 

- the caption of the row that displays the calculation in the Table control. If this caption does not exist, the row will be created. If this caption exists, the calculation will be displayed in the requested column. 

- the name of three procedures. These procedures are used to: 

	- initialize the calculation,

	- to perform a calculation for each row of the Table control,

	- perform the final calculation if necessary. 







Example: 

```wl
TableFormulaDeleteAll(TABLE_MyTable)
nRow is int
nRow = TableFormulaAdd(TABLE_MyTable.COL_Num, "Positive mean", ProcInit, ProcAdd, ProcEnd)
// Change the background color of the row for custom calculation
COL_Num[nRow].BackgroundColor = LightRed

nCounter is int
INTERNAL PROCEDURE ProcInit() 
	nCounter = 0
	RESULT 0
END

INTERNAL PROCEDURE ProcAdd(Accumulator, ColValue) 
	// Ignores the negative numbers or NULL
	IF (ColValue <= 0) RESULT Accumulator
	nCounter++
	RESULT Accumulator + ColValue
END
INTERNAL PROCEDURE ProcEnd(Accumulator) 
	IF nCounter = 0 THEN RESULT 0
	// Calculate the mean
	RESULT Accumulator/nCounter
END
```


Remarks: 

- The custom calculation rows are automatically recalculated as soon as the content of the Table or TreeView Table control changes.
	Tip: The iteration procedure is called for each row: we advise you not to perform slow calculations (avoid the accesses to the database for example).

- The [TotalsEnabled](../Proprietes/2510122.md) property does not allow or forces automatic or custom calculations in a Table control. 

- If the [DisplayEnabled](../Proprietes/2510015.md) property is used on the Table control and is set to <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>, the column calculations are not updated. 

- The following syntax is used to retrieve the value of the custom calculation for a column: 
	
	```txt
	<Table control>.<Column name>[Row number]
	```
where &lt;Row number&gt; is the row index returned by [TableFormulaAdd](../WDLang1/1000022361.md). 





### Position of calculation row
<a name="position_calculation_row_ELTPARAGRAPHE000072"></a>

To configure the position of automatic or custom column calculations:

1. Go to the "General" tab of the Table control (to do so, select the name of the Table control and click "General").

2. Specify the location of totals. To display the results:

	- in one or more rows directly added after the last control row, check "In the table, after the last row".
			These rows are visible:

		- at the bottom of the Table control if the control includes no vertical scrollbar.

		- when the vertical scrollbar is located at the very bottom if the Table control includes a vertical scrollbar.




- below the Table control, check "Below the table".
			These rows are always visible.

- you also have the ability to perform column calculations without displaying them ("No display" option).

3. Validate the Table control description window.





### Customizing the calculation row
<a name="customizing_the_calculation_row_ELTPARAGRAPHE000094"></a>

You have the ability to customize (caption, color, font, height, ...): 

- the added row by using the following syntax: 
	
	```txt
	<Table control>[Row number].<Property> = <New value>
	```


- the cell containing the result by using the following syntax: 
	
	```txt
	<Table control>.<Column name>[Row number].<Property> = <New value>
	```

	Caution: the first column contains the caption of the calculation if it exists. 


where: 

- &lt;Row number&gt; is the row index returned by [TableFormulaAdd](../WDLang1/1000022361.md). 

- &lt;Property&gt; can correspond to one of the following properties:

### Deleting the custom calculation rows
<a name="deleting_the_custom_calculation_rows_ELTPARAGRAPHE000120"></a>

To delete the custom calculation rows, use [TableFormulaDeleteAll](../WDLang1/1000022362.md). 

<a name="NOTE3"></a>
<a name="NOTE3_1"></a>


## Exporting the results of calculations
<a name="exporting_the_results_calculations_ELTTEXTE000367"></a>


### Export via the AAF (Automatic Application Features) of Table control
<a name="export_via_the_aaf_automatic_application_features_table_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000134"></a>

The context menu of Table and TreeView Table controls contains several options to export the control content. 

During this export, the results of custom calculations are exported. 

**Remark**: Only the value is exported, not the caption. 


### Export via the WLanguage functions
<a name="export_via_the_wlanguage_functions_ELTPARAGRAPHE000145"></a>

Several WLanguage functions can be used to export the content of a Table control in a specific format (Word, Excel, XML, ...). During this export, the rows corresponding to calculations are also exported by default.

To avoid exporting the calculation rows, all you have to do is specify the *taNoTotal* constant in the following functions:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [TableToClipboard](../WDLang1/1000017062.md) | Copies the content of a Table or TreeView Table control to the clipboard. |
| [TableToExcel](../WDLang1/3074033.md) | Creates an Excel file with the data from a Table or TreeView Table control. |
| [TableToText](../WDLang1/1000017061.md) | Creates a character string from the data found in a Table or TreeView Table control. |
| [TableToWord](../WDLang1/3074036.md) | Creates a Word file (.RTF) from the data found in a Table or TreeView Table control. |
