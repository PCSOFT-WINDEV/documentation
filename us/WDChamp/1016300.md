### Translate the context menu of the Calendar control
<a name="translate_the_context_menu_the_calendar_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000146"></a>

When you select a time period in a Calendar control, a context menu appears. By default, the context menu of the Calendar control is available in English and French.

To translate the context menu of the Calendar control into another language, the IW_WINDEVAafMenu_Date window must be added to your project.

To add the context menu of a Calendar control to your project: 

1. On the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, expand "Import" and select "WINDEV elements and their dependencies".

2. Select the subdirectory that contains the elements to import. The context menu of the calendar is located in the "\\Programs\\Data\\Preset windows\\AAF" subdirectory of the WINDEV setup directory.

3. WINDEV lists the elements of the directory. This directory contains the different elements corresponding to the customizable AAFs. To customize the Calendar control, select "IW_WINDEVAafMenu_Date".

4. Validate. The internal window is included in the project.




Remarks:

- The window must not be renamed.

- If this window is included in your application, you may not benefit from the improvements made to this window during the different updates. Don't forget to check whether this window has evolved.

- Caution: To modify this window, the corresponding file must not be read-only. Modify the characteristics of the file in Windows if necessary.




To customize the context menu of the calendar: 

1. Display the "IW_WinDevAafMenu_Date" window.

2. In the "UI" tab, click the button to the right of "Context menu". Select "Edit this context menu".

3. The context menu appears in the editor. For example, you can translate the various options into the desired language.
