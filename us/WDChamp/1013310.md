<a name="control_dynamic_static_page_ELTPARAGRAPHE000014"></a>

The Flex control is used to display a Flash® animation created by a Flex editor in a WEBDEV page.

**Remark**: To display a Flash® animation created by a Flex editor, the browser must be equipped with Adobe Flash Player version 10 (or later).

To create a Flex control: 

1. On the "Creation" tab, in the "Integration" group, expand "Plug-in" and select "Flex control".

2. Click where you want to create the control in the page. The control appears in the editor.

3. In the control description, associate the Flash® animation (".swf" file) with the Flex control.




To view the characteristics of the control, select "Description" in the context menu.


### Remark: Location of the animation
<a name="remark_location_the_animation_ELTPARAGRAPHE000040"></a>

It is recommended to place the Flex animation in the directory of images (&lt;Project_Name&gt;_WEB directory). The dependency files of the animation (images, text files, ...) must also be copied into the &lt;Project_Name&gt;_WEB directory.

If the animation is using Javascript files (.js), these files must be included in the page ("Advanced" tab of the page description).
