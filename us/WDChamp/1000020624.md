## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000139"></a>
The Surface chart is used to represent correlated analogical data, according to 3 axes. For example: 

- represent the resistance of a material according to pressure and temperature. 

- for an engine, represent the opening time of the injectors according to the volume of incoming air and engine throttle. 

- for a photo, represent the variations of lightness. 




You also have the ability to represent a mathematical function in 3 dimensions.

In this chart:

**1. Chart title**. 
The characteristics of the chart title can be defined in the "Details" tab of the control description ("Edit chart title"). 
You can define the chart title, its position and style.

**2. Gridlines**. 
The gridlines can be displayed on one or more planes of the chart via the "General" tab of the control description.
To display the gridlines through programming, use [grSurfaceGridlines](../WDLang3/1000020428.md). 

**3. Chart**. 
The chart can: 

- Display a mesh or not ("Show mesh on the surface" in the "General" tab of the control description or [grSurfaceMesh](../WDLang3/1000020430.md)). 

- Be oriented: All you have to do is define the rotation angle according to the different axes in the "General" tab of the control description window. A chart can also be oriented through programming with [grOrientation](../WDLang3/3042043.md). 

- Be oriented by the user: You just need to check "Rotate with the mouse
(charts with less than 10 000 points)" in the "General" tab of the control description window. 

- Include colors: Use [grSurfaceAltitudeColor](../WDLang3/1000020427.md) to define the colors to be used. 




**4. Marks**. 
The marks according to the axes can be defined in the "General" tab of the control description window. 

The caption of the marks can be defined by [grSurfaceMarkCaption](../WDLang3/1000020617.md). 

The description window of the control allows you to define the marker used. You have the ability to use an orthonormal set of markers or not.
