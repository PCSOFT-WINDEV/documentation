A wire can be: 

- made of one or more segments. 

- straight, with a right angle or free. 




When moving one of the controls attached to the wire, the wire automatically follows the position of linked controls.

## Creating a Wire control
<a name="creating_wire_control_ELTTEXTE000186"></a>
Several methods can be used **to create a Wire control**: 

- **Creation from the selection of two controls**: 

	1. Select the two controls to link: use the lasso or press the Ctrl key to select both controls. 

	2. In the ribbon, on the "Creation" tab, in the "Adjust" group, click "Wire between 2 controls". 




- **Creation from the selection of a control**: 

	1. A control is selected in the window. 

	2. In the ribbon, on the "Creation" tab, in the "Adjust" group, click "Wire between 2 controls". 

	3. A wizard asks you to add the end control to the selection. Press the Ctrl key then click the end control. 

	4. Click the "Create the wire" button. The Wire control is created. 




- **Creation from no selection**: 

	1. In the ribbon, on the "Creation" tab, in the "Adjust" group, click "Wire between 2 controls". 

	2. A wizard asks you: 

		- to select the start control. 

		- to add the end control to the selection. Press the Ctrl key then click the end control.  




3. Click the "Create the wire" button. The Wire control is created.




To view the characteristics of the control, select "Description" in the context menu.

## Characteristics of the Wire control
<a name="characteristics_the_wire_control_ELTTEXTE000210"></a>
The "General" tab in the description window of the Wire control is used to define the characteristics of the control: 

- Characteristics of the start control for the wire: 

	- Control name. 

	- Shape of the extremity of the Wire control for the start control. This shape can be an arrow, a triangle, a circle, ... 

	- Position of the attach point of the Wire control on the start control. The attach point can be positioned at the top, bottom, right or left of the control. 




- Characteristics of the end control for the wire: 

	- Control name. 

	- Shape of the extremity of the Wire control for the end control. This shape can be an arrow, a triangle, a circle, ...

	- Position of the attach point of the Wire control on the end control. The attach point can be positioned at the top, bottom, right or left of the control. 




- Dimensions and routing: 

	- Line thickness for the Wire control. This thickness is expressed in pixels. 

	- Size of extremity shapes. This size is expressed in pixels. 

	- Type of routing: Two types of routing are available: 

		- At right angle: The Wire control can be split into several segments. 

		- In straight line: The Wire control includes a single segment. 







All these characteristics can be modified through programming with several WLanguage properties. For more details, see [Handling a Wire control through programming](../WDChamp/1410087004.md).
