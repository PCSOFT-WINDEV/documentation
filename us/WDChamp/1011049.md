- the name of the block.

- the break item linked to the block (break blocks only).

- the parameters and the print options of block. For more details, see the [Parameters and print options of a block](#NOTE3_1).

- the height of block.

- the style of block (background color, border, ...).

## Parameters and print options of a block
<a name="parameters_and_print_options_block_ELTTEXTE000229"></a>
The parameters and the print options of a block are defined in the "UI" tab of its description (double click on the caption of the block).

The parameters and the print options of the report blocks are as follows:

- **Visibility**: 

	- **Visible**:
			The block can be displayed or not. If a block is invisible, the block and its controls will not be displayed in the report.
			This characteristic can be modified programmatically with the [Visible](../Proprietes/2510138.md) property.

	- **Always visible**: 
			The block and its controls will be displayed on all the pages of the report.
			 This option is available for the Page Header and Page Footer blocks. 

	- **Always invisible**: 
			The block and its controls will not be displayed in the report.
			 This option is available for the Page Header and Page Footer blocks. 

	- **Visible on the first page only**: 
			The block and its controls will be displayed on the first page of the report.
			 This option is available for the Page Header and Page Footer blocks. 

	- **Invisible on the first page only**: 
			The block and its controls will be displayed on all the pages of the report except for the first one.
			 This option is available for the Page Header and Page Footer blocks. 




- **Breakability**: 

	- **Breakable block**: 
			If a block is breakable and there is not enough space left on a page to print the entire block, the content of the block is printed on several pages. 
			If a block is unbreakable and there is not enough space on the page to print the entire block, the content of the block is printed on the next page.




- **Filling the page**: 

	- **Completion until the end of the page**:
			A block can be stretched until it reaches the end of the page.
			**Remark**: This option is useful if the block has a background image or a background color.

	- **Extend the table columns until the end of the page** (for the blocks containing a table):
			The table columns can be extended until they reach the end of the page.
			**Remark**: To extend the table columns until the page footer, you also have the ability to add a *Body complement* block. The *Body complement* blocks are automatically stretched until they reach the end of the page.

	- **Repeated until the end of the page**:
			The block can be copied until it reaches the end of the page.
			This option is available especially for the Body block. 

	- **Keep space for the page footer when it is invisible** (for the Page Footer blocks only):
			By default, the space occupied by the Page Footer block will always be kept in the report pages (no matter whether the block is visible or not). With this option, the space occupied by the Page Footer block will be kept only in the pages where this block is visible. This option is used to optimize the method for filling the report pages.

	- **Reset the number of pages after printing the block**: By default, the number of pages in the " Number of pages" and "Number of pages and page number" preset controls are not reset during the print job. This option allows you to automatically reset these preset controls once the block is printed (during a break or at the end of the print). 
			This option can be used when printing a set of invoices for example, to number the pages of each invoice independently.




- **Automatic break**:

	- **Page break after the block**:
			A page break can be automatically generated once the block is printed.

	- **Column break after the block**: (only for the Body block of multi-column reports)
			A column break can be automatically generated once the block is printed.
