## The different options
<a name="the_different_options_ELTTEXTE000165"></a>


### Printer
<a name="printer_ELTPARAGRAPHE000025"></a>

The report viewer allows you to select the printer: 

- When printing reports created via the report editor or Reports and Queries, you can select the printer in the list of available printers. 

- For print jobs configured programmatically (with WLanguage print functions), only the default printer or the printer previously selected with [iConfigure](../WDLang5/3046072.md) is available.




**Remark**: If a different printer is used in the report viewer, it will remain selected:

- for future print jobs (started directly or via the report viewer),

- until [iReset](../WDLang5/3046067.md) is called again




The "Printer properties" option opens the configuration window of the selected printer. 

### Parameters
<a name="parameters_ELTPARAGRAPHE000048"></a>

These are the available print settings: 

- **Color or black and white printing**. 
	The report viewer shows the print preview with colors, regardless of the printer capabilities and configuration. Thus, even if the default printer is a black and white printer, the print colors are displayed in the viewer.
	When the viewer is opened, the "Color/Black and white" radio button option is selected according to the printer settings:

	- if the selected printer is a "black and white" printer, the "Black and white" option is selected, 

	- if the selected printer is a "color" printer, the "Color" option is selected, 

	- if the selected printer is a "color" printer but if it is set to "black and white", the "Black and white" option is selected.


 Similarly, if a new printer is selected in the report viewer, the "Color/Black and white" radio button option changes according to the characteristics of the new printer.
	The "Color/Black and white" radio button defines the physical print job launched from the viewer: the option selected by the end user takes precedence over the printer settings.
	Any change of the "Color/Black and white" option is applied to the current preview only:

- the printer settings are not modified, 

- the next preview will reposition the "Color/Black and white" option according to the printer settings.

- **Duplex mode printing**. 
	The "Duplex" option corresponds to the printer parameters. If these options are modified in the report viewer, only the printer settings are modified. 

- **Report orientation, paper size, etc.**: A combo box can be displayed to choose the orientation of the document, the paper size, ...
