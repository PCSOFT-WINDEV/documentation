<a name="default_events_ELTTEXTE000125"></a>
WINDEV manages the following events by default (in order of appearance in the code editor):

| Whenever modifying | Executed each time the Image Editor control is modified. |
| --- | --- |
| Initializing | Executed when the window is opened. \* |
| Before closing a document | Run before closing the image in the Image Editor control. |
| After loading a document | Run once the image was loaded in the Image Editor control. |
| Event | Runtime condition |


(\*) By default, the "Initializing" event of each control is executed according to the order in which the controls were created in the window. To modify this order of execution: 

1. On the "Window" tab, in the "Order" group, click "Initialization".

2. In the window that appears, use the arrows on the right to change the order in which the controls are initialized.

<a name="optional_event_after_running_ocr_the_selected_region_ELTPARAGRAPHE000076"></a>

The Image Editor control includes a specific optional event: "After running OCR on the selected region". This event sets up a specific action to be performed when the user selects "OCR" in the Image Editor ribbon. By default, the text on which OCR is run is copied to the clipboard. This event allows you to perform a specific process on the retrieved text, for example.
