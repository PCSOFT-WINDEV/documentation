## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000203"></a>
The report editor allows you to create "Scheduler" reports. 

In this case, the report contains a Scheduler control only. This type of control is created when creating a Scheduler report: it cannot be created independently of the report. 

Example: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Etat_Planning.gif&type=thumb)


In the editor, this control includes two blocks: 

- The "Header" block that displays the titles of the columns found in the schedule. 

- The "Schedule" block that displays the resources and the appointments in a Scheduler control.

## Creating a Scheduler report
<a name="creating_scheduler_report_ELTTEXTE000227"></a>


### Creating the report
<a name="creating_the_report_ELTPARAGRAPHE000029"></a>

To create a "Scheduler" report: 

1. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_nouveau.gif) in the quick access buttons. 

2. The new element window appears: click "Report" then "Report". 

3. The report creation wizard starts. 

4. In this wizard, specify:

	- the type of report to create ("Scheduler report") with the [information specific to the creation of a scheduler control](#NOTE2_2): 

		- the number of days to display.

		- the granularity of gridlines.

		- the display mode of resources (ressources displayed by rows or in columns).  




- the template used if necessary, 

- the data source of the report (data file, query, Scheduler control, ...). For more details, see [Report data source](../WDChamp/1011055.md).



<a name="NOTE2_2"></a>


### Information specific to the creation of the Scheduler
<a name="information_specific_the_creation_the_scheduler_ELTPARAGRAPHE000062"></a>

The following information is specific to the creation of the Scheduler control:

- Number of days to display in the Scheduler control: The schedule can be printed: 

	- for a day, 

	- for a week on 5 days, 

	- for a week on 7 days, 

	- for a month, 

	- from the first appointment to the last one, 

	- with a custom number of days. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Ass_Creation_pln.gif)





- The granularity of gridlines. This granularity is used to define the size of the grid used to display the gridlines of the Scheduler control. This granularity is set to 30 minutes by default. This information must be modified according to the number of days to display. 
	This characteristic can be modified in the code via the [GranularityGridlines](../Proprietes/1000020107.md) property. 

- The display mode of resources. The resources can be displayed by rows or in columns. 




**Remark**:  If the Scheduler report is linked to a data source (query, data file), you must specify the items that will be taken into account for displaying the schedule and the appointments. The following information must be specified: 

- the title of appointment

- the resource associated with the appointment

- the start and end dates of appointment

## Characteristics of a Scheduler report and Scheduler control

### Characteristics of the Scheduler (report editor)
<a name="characteristics_the_scheduler_report_editor_ELTPARAGRAPHE000094"></a>

You have the ability to modify the following characteristics of a Scheduler report: 

- The data source of the Scheduler report can be modified in the "Data" tab of the description window of the report ("Report description" in the context menu of the report). 

- The "General" tab in the description window of Scheduler control is used to specify: 

	- the number of days that must be displayed in the control. 

	- the granularity of gridlines.

	- the visible time period. 

	- the display of appointments for the entire day. If the "Show all-day appointments" option is checked, the report supports appointments for which the "WholeDay" property is set to true (for more details, see [Appointment variable](../WDLang1/1000019244.md)). In this case, a specific area used to display the daily appointments appears in the schedule: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Planning_journee_Etat.gif)
Remark: Make sure that the area used to display the daily appointments has the proper dimensions in the report editor. It can be resized if necessary.

	- the custom report to display the appointments. 

		- If the selected option is "None", the default display is used. 

		- If "Preset report" is selected, a preset report is automatically added to the project. This report is named "RPT_WinDevViewAPT" by default and is automatically used to display appointments.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Etat_WinDevvueRDV.gif)
This report can be customized, renamed, etc.

		- If the selected option corresponds to a project report, this report will be used to display the appointments.
						We advise you to customize the report proposed by default.
						The same report can be used to customize the appointments in a Scheduler or Organizer report.  




- the display mode of resources: in rows or columns. If the resources are displayed by columns, you have the ability to specify the number of resources displayed by columns. 

- the display mask for the dates and times. 

- If the Scheduler control is linked to a data source (data file, query, ...), the "Content" tab found in the description window of the control is used to link the appointment data with the data found in the data source. 

- The "Style" tab in the description window of the Scheduler control is used to specify the style: 

	- for the caption of resources.

	- for the appointments displayed in the Scheduler control.
