## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000107"></a>
WEBDEV allows you to define overlayable controls: overlayable controls can be displayed above other controls. 

An overlayable control can be anchored in relation to its container or in relation to another page control.

### Defining an anchor on overlayable controls
<a name="defining_anchor_overlayable_controls_ELTPARAGRAPHE000018"></a>

To define an anchor on overlayable controls:

1. Select the overlayable control.  
	Reminder: To define an overlayable control, check "The control can be overlaid" in the "UI" tab of the control description. 

2. Define the element anchoring:

	- in the "UI" tab of the element description window.

	- via the "Anchor" option in the context menu of the desired element.  




3. The following window appears:

In this window, the options are as follows: 

	- **Position**: In "Move like the following reference control", select the reference control of the overlayable control. The overlayable control will move in the same way. This reference control can be: 

		- The container associated with the control (a Cell control or the page containing the control for example). 

		- Another control of same parent (a control associated with the cell for example).  

		- Another page control (not overlayable). 


 Then, if necessary, specify the position of the overlayable control after being moved. 

- **Anchor in width**: allows you to define how the control will react (horizontally) when the reference control is resized. The overlaid control can:

	- keep the same width,

	- adapt to the content, 

	- change along with the browser.![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Ancrage_Largeur_WB.gif)

4. Validate. The overlayable control is anchored.
