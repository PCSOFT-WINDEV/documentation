- Cancel/Restore the last action. 

- Cut/Copy/Paste: These options can be applied to a cell, a column, a row or a selection of cells. 

- Cancel zoom: This option is used to cancel the zoom performed by Ctrl + Mouse Wheel for example. 

- Insert: This option is used to insert a row or a column. 

- Delete: This option is used to delete the content from a cell, row or column. Caution: the entire content is immediately deleted (value, formula, ...). 

- Save as: This option is used to save the content of Spreadsheet control in a new xlsx file. 




Remark: You can add options to this menu from the code. To do so, use the [ContextMenu](../Proprietes/2510077.md) property.
