## Creating a control in a page
<a name="creating_control_page_ELTTEXTE000574"></a>


### Creating a control in a page
<a name="creating_control_page_ELTPARAGRAPHE000045"></a>

To create a control in a page:

1. Go to the "Creation" tab in the page editor. This tab contains all the types of controls that can be created in a page. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Page_Creation_champ.gif&type=thumb)
According to the type of control to create: 

	- click its icon. 

	- if an arrow is displayed beside the control name, expand the list and select the type of control to create.




2. Click where you want to create the control in the page.




**Remark**: To create a new column in a Table control from the page editor:

1. Select the Table control.

2. Right-click to open the context menu: 

	- select "Add a column". 

	- select the type of column to create.

### Creating a control from a dictionary control
<a name="creating_control_from_dictionary_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000068"></a>

WEBDEV allows you to create a control from a control found in a dictionary (".DIC" file). A dictionary allows you to store elements (controls, pages, ...) for a future use in the new projects. For more details, see [Dictionary](../Editeurs/2023002.md).

To create a control from a control found in a dictionary:

1. Display the ["Dictionary" pane](../Editeurs/2027014.md).

2. Open the dictionary if necessary ("Open" in the context menu).

3. Select the initial control found in the dictionary (in the "Page controls" category).

4. Perform a Drag and Drop of the control found in the dictionary toward its future position in the page.

5. Subscribe the created control to the dictionary if necessary. If the created control subscribes to the dictionary, the modifications made to the control found in the dictionary will be automatically applied to the created control. For more details, see [Subscribing an element to the dictionary](../Editeurs/2023001.md).

### Creating a control from the clipboard content
<a name="creating_control_from_the_clipboard_content_ELTPARAGRAPHE000092"></a>

The page editor allows you to create specific types of controls according to the clipboard content:

| Clipboard content | Type of created control |
| --- | --- |
| Text, copied from a text editor for example. | Static control |
| Image file copied from Windows explorer. | Image control |
| Image, copied from an HTML page for example. | Image control |
| Description of a data file, copied from the data model editor of WEBDEV or from the ["Analysis" pane](../Editeurs/2027012.md). | Table based on a data file |
| Item of a data file, copied from the ["Analysis" pane](../Editeurs/2027012.md). | Control created by RAD according to the type of control specified in the "RAD" tab of item description. |


To create a control from the clipboard content:

1. Copy the element to the clipboard ("Edit .. Copy" or Ctrl + C).

2. In the page editor, on the "Home" tab, in the "Edit" group, click "Paste" (or Ctrl + V).




**Remark**: You have the ability to explicitly choose the format in which the clipboard content must be pasted in the page editor: on the "Home" tab, in the "Edit" group, expand "Paste" and select "Special paste". For more details, see [Special paste](../Editeurs/2026001.md).

<a name="binding_control_data_file_item_ELTTEXTE000647"></a>


### How to proceed?
<a name="how_proceed_ELTPARAGRAPHE000182"></a>

3. Enter the information about the bound item.




**Remark**: You also have the ability to directly create:

- an edit control from an item of a data file:

	1. In the ["Analysis" pane](../Editeurs/2027012.md), select the item that will be bound to the control to be created.

	2. Drag and drop the item onto the position where you want to create the bound Edit control.




- a Table control from a data file:

	1. In the ["Analysis" pane](../Editeurs/2027012.md), select the data file that will be related to the Table control to be created.

	2. Drag and drop the item onto the position where you want to create the bound Table control. The Table control creation wizard starts automatically.

## Selecting, grouping and deleting the page controls
<a name="selecting_grouping_and_deleting_the_page_controls_ELTTEXTE000677"></a>


### Selecting one or more controls from a page
<a name="selecting_one_more_controls_from_page_ELTPARAGRAPHE000228"></a>

<a name="NOTE4_2"></a>


### Grouping controls in a page
<a name="grouping_controls_page_ELTPARAGRAPHE000243"></a>

Several controls can be grouped together. This grouping simplifies the move of several controls for example

Reminder: Two types of groups are available:

- the grouping of controls in order to handle several controls in the page editor.

- the [groups of controls](../WDChamp/1010016.md) to handle several controls through programming.




To group controls:

1. Select the controls to group (see [Selecting one or more controls](../Editeurs/2026007.md)).

2. On the "Modification" tab, in the "Depth and Alignment" group, click "Group selection" (Ctrl + G).




To dissociate grouped controls:

1. Select a control that belongs to the group. WEBDEV automatically selects all the grouped controls.

2. On the "Modification" tab, in the "Depth and Alignment" group, click "Group selection" and select "Dissociate selection" (Ctrl + Shift + G).
