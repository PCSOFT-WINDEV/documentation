**To fully customize the display of appointments** (required for translation):

1. Open the Scheduler control description window. 

2. In the "General" tab, select the internal window used for the appointments: 

	- "None": the default display mode will be used. 

	- "Preset window": If this option is selected, the WDAAF internal component is immediately added to the current project. 

		- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) The "IW_WinDevViewAPT" internal window is automatically associated with the "Internal window for the appointments" option. 


 Remarks: 

- If the WDAAF component already exists, only the window is added to the component.  

- This window is also used to customize appointments in Organizer controls.  

- Any internal window in your project. 

3. If necessary, validate the control description window. 




**Remarks**: 

- The custom internal window is available in the "Project explorer" pane, in the "Internal components" folder. It can be edited in the window editor. 
	**Caution**: this internal window can only be used to customize the display of appointments. Only the "Global declarations" event is executed. No other events are executed. Therefore, you cannot add buttons with a specific click code. 

- If you are using the suggested preset window, the style options of the appointment (selected in the "Style" tag) are applied.
