## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000105"></a>
Here are the main concepts for programming browsing Looper controls.

Several WLanguage functions allow you to manage the browsing Looper controls through programming.

Do not hesitate to see the documentation about these functions. For more details, see: [Looper control management functions](../WDLang2/3083007.md).

## Adding or modifying a row in a Looper control based on a data file
<a name="adding_modifying_row_looper_control_based_data_file_ELTTEXTE000129"></a>
The addition and modification of a row in a Looper control (and of a record in the data file) consist of two phases:

1. Add or modify the record in data the file (via a form window or page, for example)

2. Redisplaying the content of the browsing Looper control ([LooperDisplay](../WDLang2/3083001.md)).

## Deleting a row from a Looper control based on a data file
<a name="deleting_row_from_looper_control_based_data_file_ELTTEXTE000153"></a>
To delete a row from a Looper control based on a data file:: 

1. Delete the record from the data file (via [HDelete](../WDLang4/3044018.md)).

2. Redisplay the content of the browsing Looper control (via [LooperDisplay](../WDLang2/3083001.md)).


**Important**: [LooperRecNum](../WDLang2/3083010.md) returns the number of the current record in a Looper control based on a data file.
