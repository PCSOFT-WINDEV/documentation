## Events managed by default in a window
<a name="events_managed_default_window_ELTTEXTE000151"></a>
WINDEV manages the following events by default (in order of appearance in the code editor):

| Event | Runtime condition |
| --- | --- |
| Initializing | Executed when the window is opened. \* |
| Entry | Run when the control takes focus. |
| Exit | Run when moving from one control to another (TAB key, selecting another control with the mouse, etc.) |
| Displaying a cell | Run when the result is displayed in a cell. |
| Selecting a cell | Run when selecting a cell (with the mouse for example) |


(\*) By default, the "Initializing" event of each control is executed according to the order in which the controls were created in the window. To modify this order of execution: 

1. On the "Window" tab, in the "Order" group, click "Initialization".

2. In the window that appears, use the arrows on the right to change the order in which the controls are initialized.

<a name="events_managed_default_report_ELTTEXTE000175"></a>
WINDEV manages the following events by default (in order of appearance in the code editor):

| Event | Runtime condition |
| --- | --- |
| Initializing | Run when initializing the report. |
| Before printing | Run before printing a control. |
| Before printing cell | Run before printing a cell found in the Pivot Table control.

The name of this control starts with "VAL_".<br><br>You have the ability to modify the properties of this control (color, background color, ...) according to its value:<br><br><br><pre><code>IF VAL_PVT > 400 then<br>	VAL_PVT.Color = LightGreen<br>	VAL_PVT.BackgroundColor = LightRed<br>END</code></pre><br> |

3. Click the link "Add other events to xxx" at the bottom of the window code, after the last event.  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Traitements_optionnels_WD_OK%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)


4. All the optional events available for the control are displayed. 

5. Check the optional event to add and validate.

6. The selected optional event is automatically added to the events managed by the control.




To disable an optional event, simply perform the same operations to display the list of optional events. Then simply uncheck the optional events to delete. 
Remark: If the disabled code contains WLanguage code, this code is automatically deleted.You can manage, for example:

- the mouse hover over the control,

- left mouse button down, up, double click,

- right mouse button down, up, double click, 

- mouse wheel, etc.
