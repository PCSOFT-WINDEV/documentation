## Overview of the Flexbox control
<a name="overview_the_flexbox_control_ELTTEXTE000122"></a>
Flexbox is a standard layout system for web pages. Flexbox controls were introduced in WEBDEV 28. 

It's as easy as it gets: 

- Drop the controls onto the Flexbox control.

- The Flexbox control then automatically positions the controls according to the desired parameters.




For example, the Flexbox control allows you to: 

- Define how controls are positioned when the browser is resized. For more details, see [Flexbox example: automatic control layout](../WDChamp/1410087285.md). 

- Set ratios to distribute available space among the controls. For more details, see [Flexbox example: ratios to distribute available space among controls](../WDChamp/1410087275.md).
