**Caution: Do not confuse "Internal Page control" and "Internal page": the "Internal Page control" is a type of control and the "Internal page" is a type of page**.

WEBDEV manages the following events for **"Internal Page" controls**:


| Event | Runtime condition |
| --- | --- |
| After loading the internal page<br>(Server code) | Run when the internal page is changed by [ChangeSourcePage](../WDLang2/1000024600.md). This event is run after the "Global declarations" and "Initializing" events of the new internal page.<br><br>This event allows you, for example, to initialize controls or to restore values in the internal page.<br><br>[ChangeSourcePage](../WDLang2/1000024600.md) must not be used in this event. |
| Before unloading the internal page<br>(Server code) | Run when the internal page is changed by [ChangeSourcePage](../WDLang2/1000024600.md). This event is run before the closing event of the initial internal page.<br><br>This event is used, for example, to save the values present in the internal page.<br><br>[ChangeSourcePage](../WDLang2/1000024600.md) must not be used in this event. |




WEBDEV manages the following events for **Internal pages**: 


| Event | Runtime condition |
| --- | --- |
| Global declarations<br>(Server code) | Declaration of variables global to the page. This is the first code run when opening the page.<br>This code is run before the code for declaring global variables of the host page (page in which the internal page is included).<br>You can, for example, call a procedure of the internal page from the declaration of global variables of the host page. |
| Initializing<br>(Server code) | Executed when the page is opened.<br>The events are run in the following order:<br><br>- Initializing the page controls.<br><br>- Initializing the page.<br><br><br> |
| Set the Value property<br>(Server code) | Executed each time the ***Value*** property is assigned to the internal page (directly or with the Value property). This code is used, for example, to retrieve the parameters passed to the internal page. |
| Get the Value property<br>(Server code) | Executed each time the ***Value*** property is retrieved from the internal page. This code allows the internal page to return a value to the page that hosts the Internal Page control. |
| Loading (onload) the internal page <br>(Browser code) | Browser code run when the internal page is displayed in the browser (performed by [PageDisplay](../WDLang2/3058008.md) or [PageRefresh](../WDLang2/3058011.md), for example). |
| Request for refreshing the display<br>(Server code) | Used to group the code for refreshing the page controls: content of controls, state (visible, grayed, etc.), caption to refresh, etc.<br><br>This event can receive parameters. Simply declare a procedure in the event. For example: <br><br><br><pre><code>// Request for refreshing the display<br>PROCEDURE AskForRefresh(RefreshType is Boolean)</code></pre><br><br><br>This event is started upon request by the following functions: <br><br>- [RequestRefreshUI](../WDLang1/1000023899.md) or [RequestRefreshUIParent](../WDLang1/1000023900.md): Executes the event at the end of the current event (asynchronous execution). <br><br>- [ExecuteRefreshUI](../WDLang1/1000023901.md) or [ExecuteRefreshUIParent](../WDLang1/1000023902.md): Executes the event immediately. <br><br><br>When these functions are called, you can specify the value of the parameters expected by the event. |
| Closing<br>(Server code) | Executed when the page is closed.<br>**Remark**: Resuming the input in one of the page controls in this code prevents the page from closing. |
