## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

### Resizing the current widget

`DashResizeWidget(<Width> , <Height> [, <Options>])`
---

**`<Width>: (Integer)`**

Width of current widget in number of cells or in pixels. The minimum size corresponds to a cell. The value in pixels is rounded to correspond to an integer number of cells. 

The widget used corresponds to the control to which the current event belongs (Widget or control belonging to the widget). 

**`<Height>: (Integer)`**

Height of current widget in number of cells or in pixels. The minimum size corresponds to a cell. The value in pixels is rounded to correspond to an integer number of cells.

The widget used corresponds to the control to which the current event belongs (Widget or control belonging to the widget). 

**`<Options>: (Optional Integer constant)`**

Allows you to define the unit used and the reorganization mode: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *dashNoReorganization* | Resizes the widget without reorganizing the adjacent widgets.<br><br>Caution: Using the *dashNoReorganization* constant may produce an incorrect display (with overlapping widgets). When using this constant, it is important to entirely reorganize the Dashboard control with **DashResizeWidget** and [DashMoveWidget](../WDLang1/1000021289.md). |
| *dashUnitCell*<br>(Default value) | The unit used for the widget size is a number of cells. |
| *dashUnitPixel* | The unit used for the widget size is the pixel. |

### Resizing a widget identified by its index

`DashResizeWidget(<Dashboard control> , <Widget index> , <Width> , <Height> [, <Options>])`
---

**`<Dashboard control>: (Control name)`**

Name of the Dashboard control to be used.

**`<Widget index>: (Integer)`**

Index of the widget to use. This index corresponds to:

- the addition number of the widget defined in the window editor or in the page editor.

- the addition number of widget returned by [DashAddWidget](../WDLang1/1000020953.md).




**`<Width>: (Integer)`**

Width of widget in number of cells or in pixels. The minimum size corresponds to a cell. The value in pixels is rounded to correspond to an integer number of cells.

**`<Height>: (Integer)`**

Height of the widget in number of cells or in pixels. The minimum size corresponds to a cell. The value in pixels is rounded to correspond to an integer number of cells.

**`<Options>: (Optional Integer constant)`**

Allows you to define the unit used and the reorganization mode: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *dashNoReorganization* | Resizes the widget without reorganizing the adjacent widgets.<br><br>Caution: Using the *dashNoReorganization* constant may produce an incorrect display (with overlapping widgets).

## Remarks


### Rule used for calculating cells

Let's see some examples for a widget whose size is equal to 100 px by 100 px with a margin set to 10 px: 


```wl
DashResizeWidget(DASH_TimeZones, 1, 80, 80, dashUnitPixel)
// the widget will be set to 1 x 1

DashResizeWidget(DASH_TimeZones, 1, 200, 200, dashUnitPixel)
// the widget will be set to 2 x 2

DashResizeWidget(DASH_TimeZones, 1, 201, 201, dashUnitPixel)
// the widget will be set to 3 x 3

DashResizeWidget(DASH_TimeZones, 1, 400, 500, dashUnitPixel)
// the widget will be set to 4 x 5
```
