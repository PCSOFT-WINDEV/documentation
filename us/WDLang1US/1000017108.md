## Syntax

`<Result> = ServiceControl(<Service name> , <Command to send> [, <Remote computer>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the command was sent to the service manager,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md).




**`<Service name>: (Character string)`**

Name of service to check.

**`<Command to send>: (Integer constant or integer)`**

Command that will be sent to the service:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *serviceCmdPause* | Pauses the service (equivalent to [ServicePause](../WDLang1/1000017109.md)). |
| *serviceCmdRereadConfig* | Asks the service to re-read its configuration settings (equivalent to [ServiceRefresh](../WDLang1/1000017107.md)). |
| *serviceCmdRestart* | Restarts a service (equivalent to [ServiceContinue](../WDLang1/1000017105.md)). |
| *serviceCmdStop* | Stops the service (equivalent to [ServiceStop](../WDLang1/1000017111.md)). |


You also have the ability to use an integer included between 128 and 255. This range of values is intended for the commands defined by the service itself (see the documentation about the service for more details).

**`<Remote computer>: (Optional character string)`**

IP address of the remote computer in xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx format (returned by [NetIPAddress](../WDLang3/3056023.md)) or name of the remote computer (returned by [NetMachineName](../WDLang3/3056014.md)). This parameter is used to control a service on another computer. To use this option, the user must be administrator of remote computer. 
If this parameter is not specified or if it corresponds to an empty string, the service is handled locally.
