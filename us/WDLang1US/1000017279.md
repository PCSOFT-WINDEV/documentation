Moves a row or swaps two rows in a List Box or Combo Box control. 

**Remarks**:            

- To move a row in a Table control, use [TableMoveLine](../WDLang1/1000017247.md).

- To move a row in a Looper control, use [LooperMoveLine](../WDLang2/1000017248.md).

## Example


```wl
// Swap the current row and row 5
ListMoveRow(LIST_List1, rowSelected , 5, amSwap)
// Move the current row to row 3
ListMoveRow(LIST_List1, rowSelected , 3, amMove)
// Swap the current row with the next row
ListMoveLine (LIST_List1, rowSelected, amNext, amSwap)
```

## Syntax

### Moving to a specific position

`<Result> = ListMoveLine(<List Box control> , <Index of row to move> , <Destination row index> [, <Operation to perform>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**

New index of the row that was moved.

**`<List Box control>: (Control name)`**

Name of the List Box or Combo Box control to be used.
If this parameter corresponds to an empty string (""), the control to which the current event belongs will be used.

**`<Index of row to move>: (Integer)`**

Position of the row to move. This position must be included between 1 and the number of rows found in the List Box or Combo Box control (returned by [ListCount](../WDLang1/3049014.md) or [Count](../Proprietes/2510097.md) for example).

To move the row that is currently selected, use the *rowSelected* constant.

**`<Destination row index>: (Integer)`**

New row position. This position must be between 1 and the number of rows in the List Box or Combo Box control (returned by [ListCount](../WDLang1/3049014.md) or [Count](../Proprietes/2510097.md), for example). A fatal error occurs if this parameter is not valid.

To handle the row that is currently selected, use the *rowSelected* constant.

**`<Operation to perform>: (Optional Integer constant (or combination of constants))`**

Change of position that will be performed for the row:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *amDisplayDestination* | The modified row is displayed in the List Box control (or Combo Box). An automatic scroll of the rows is performed if necessary to display the modified row. The selected row (selection bar) is not modified.<br>This constant can be combined with the *amMove* and *amSwap* constants.<br><br><br> |
| *amMove*<br>(default value) | The row is moved to the index of the destination row. |
| *amSwap* | The source and destination rows are swapped. |

### Moving relatively to the current position

`<Result> = ListMoveLine(<List Box control> , <Index of row to move> , <Relative move> [, <Operation to perform>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**



- New index of the row that was moved,

- 0 if an error occurs.




**`<List Box control>: (Control name)`**

Name of the List Box control to be used.
If this parameter corresponds to an empty string (""), the control to which the current event belongs will be used.

**`<Index of row to move>: (Integer)`**

Position of the row to move. This position must be included between 1 and the number of rows in the List Box control (returned by [ListCount](../WDLang1/3049014.md) or [Count](../Proprietes/2510097.md) for example).

To handle the row that is currently selected, use the *rowSelected* constant.

**`<Relative move>: (Integer constant)`**

Used to move or a swap to a position relative to the index of the row to move.


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *amFirst* | Moves the row to first position. |
| *amLast* | Moves the row to last position. |
| *amNext* | Moves the row one position downwards. |
| *amNextPage* | Moves the row one page to the bottom (a page corresponds to the number of rows that can be simultaneously displayed in the List Box control).<br><br><br> |
| *amPrevious* | Moves the row one position upwards |
| *amPreviousPage* | Moves the row one page to the top (a page corresponds to the number of rows that can be simultaneously displayed in the List Box control).<br><br><br> |


If this parameter is invalid (*amPrevious* used on the first row of List Box control for example), the row is moved "to the nearest" position.

**`<Operation to perform>: (Optional Integer constant (or combination of constants))`**

Change of position that will be performed for the row:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *amDisplayDestination* | The modified row is displayed in the List Box control. An automatic scroll of the rows is performed if necessary to display the modified row. The selected row (selection bar) is not modified.<br>This constant can be combined with the *amMove* and *amSwap* constants.<br><br><br> |
| *amMove*<br>(default value) | The row is moved to the index of the destination row. |
| *amSwap* | The source and destination rows are swapped. |

## Remarks


### Operating mode on a Combo Box control
<a name="operating_mode_combo_box_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000231"></a>

When **ListMoveLine** is used on a Combo Box control, the selected element remains the same. The index of the element selected in the drop-down list (i.e. the value returned by the Combo Box control) is modified.
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Multi-selection List Box control
<a name="multiselection_list_box_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000242"></a>

If **ListMoveLine** is used on a multi-selection List Box control:

- when moving rows (*amMove* constant): all selected rows will be moved.

- when swapping rows (*amSwap* constant): only the first row will be swapped

- the *rowSelected* constant cannot be used. Otherwise, a fatal error occurs and no row is moved.

### Managing errors
<a name="managing_errors_ELTPARAGRAPHE000257"></a>

**Caution**: **ListMoveLine** returns no error code. To determine if this function has generated an error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) with the *errMessage* constant.
