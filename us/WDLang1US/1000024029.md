## Remarks


- The validity of the date passed as parameter is checked. An error message is displayed if the date is invalid. You can check the validity of a date using [DateValid](../WDLang1/3027003.md).

- **&lt;Date type&gt;.ToInteger** and [DateDifference](../WDLang1/3027001.md) can be used to calculate the number of days elapsed between two dates. 

- The date storage format allows you to store dates from 01/01/0001 to 12/31/9999. [WLanguage functions](../WDLang1/1000023943.md) and [WLanguage properties](../Proprietes/2514010.md) make accurate calculations on dates from January 1st, 1583.
