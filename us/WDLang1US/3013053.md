Name and path of help file (.HLP or .CHM). If the help file is not found, the function has no effect.

Keyword used to find the help page. 
This parameter corresponds to an empty string ("") or is not specified, the help file's index is opened and the user will be able to select the keyword he wants. If the help file has no index, the file is opened on the first help page.

`WHelp(<Name of help file> , <Context number>)`
---

**`<Name of help file>: (Character string)`**

Name and path of help file (.HLP or .CHM). If the help file is not found, the function has no effect.

**`<Context number>: (Integer)`**

## Remarks




### Changing language and help file
<a name="changing_language_and_help_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000065"></a>

In the WINDEV help editor, the name of the help file can be built from a numeric identifier corresponding to [Nation](../WDLang1/3054014.md).

In this case, to start the help file corresponding to the current language, all you have to do is use the following code:


```wl
// Start the help in CHM format
WHelp("MyFile" + NumToString(Nation(), "03d") + ".chm")
```

<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>




### Miscellaneous
<a name="miscellaneous_ELTPARAGRAPHE000080"></a>

- For more information about WinHelp, see the Windows documentation.

- To associate a context-sensitive tooltip with the controls of a window, use [HelpFile](../WDLang1/3013029.md).
