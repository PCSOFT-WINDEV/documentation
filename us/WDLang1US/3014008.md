- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if a problem occurred.




**`<Location>: (Integer constant)`**

Shortcut location:


|   |   |

**`<Name>: (Character string)`**

Name of shortcut.

**`<Command line>: (Character string)`**

Full command line associated with the shortcut. This command line will be run when a double click is performed on the link. The paths of the files containing space characters must be enclosed in quotes.
In the shortcut properties, the command line corresponds to the target.


**`<Shortcut path>: (Optional character string)`**

Directory into which the shortcut must be created (directory relative to &lt;Location&gt;). The shortcut can be created in a "Directory" (or group of programs) of "Start .. Programs" menu or in a folder on the desktop.
If &lt;Location&gt; = ***shortcutFree***, the path is absolute (the disk is specified) ; otherwise, the path is relative to the specified location.
If this parameter is not specified or if it corresponds to an empty string (""), the shortcut will be created in the specified &lt;Location&gt;.
The paths containing space characters must be enclosed in quotes.

**`<Opening mode>: (Optional integer constant)`**

Mode for opening the main window of the application associated with the link. The color of the selection bar will be modified for this control (table, list box or combo box).

| --- | --- |
| *swsIconic* | Open the minimized window. |
| *swsMaximize* | Open the maximized window. |
| *swsNormal*<br>(Default value) | Open in standard size. |



**`<Shortcut key>: (Optional character string)`**

Key (or combination of keys) allowing you to run the shortcut. Each key is represented by one or more characters. There is no need to specify "Ctrl-Alt" that is automatically added. No shortcut key is specified by default.

- To use a single keyboard character, all you have to do is use the character itself. For example, to represent the letter A, assign the value "A" to &lt;Shortcut key&gt;. 
	Caution: A special meaning is assigned by the function to the following characters:

	- plus (+), 

	- insertion (^), 

	- percentage (%), 

	- brackets ( ).


 To use one of these characters, the character must be enclosed in curly brackets. For example, to use the plus sign (+), type {+}. To use curly brackets, use the {{} and {}} characters.

- When using special characters, specific codes are required to identify:

	- the characters with no action on the screen (the Enter key for example) 

	- the characters corresponding to an action (the function keys for example).


 You must use the following codes:
	

| Key | Code | Key | Code |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BACKSPACE | {RA} | PAUSE | {PAUSE} |
| CAPSLOCK | {VERRMAJ} | DEL | {SUPPR} |
| DOWN | {DOWN} | END | {END} |
| ENTER | {ENTER} | ESC | {ECHAP} |
| HELP | {HELP} | HOME | {HOME} |
| INSERT | {INS} | LEFT | {LEFT} |
| NUMLOCK | {NUMLOCK} | PGDN | {PGDN} |
| PGUP | {PGUP} | PRNT. SCREEN | {PRTSC} |
| RIGHT | {RIGHT} | SCROLLLOCK | {SCROLLLOCK} |
| TAB | {TAB} | TOP | {TOP} |
| F1 | {F1} | F2 | {F2} |
| F3 | {F3} | F4 | {F4} |
| F5 | {F5} | F6 | {F6} |
| F7 | {F7} | F8 | {F8} |
| F9 | {F9} | F10 | {F10} |
| F11 | {F11} | F12 | {F12} |
| F13 | {F13} | F14 | {F14} |
| F15 | {F15} | F16 | {F16} |



- To specify a key combination with Shift, Ctrl or Alt, the standard key code must be preceded by one or more codes chosen among the following ones:
	

| Key | Code |
| --- | --- |
| SHIFT | + |
| Ctrl | ^ |
| Alt | % |



- To specify that the Shift, Ctrl and/or Alt keys must be hold down while pressing another key: for example, in order for the Shift key to be kept down while pressing the E key, use "+E"




**`<Working directory>: (Optional character string)`**

Working directory associated with the program run. No working directory is specified by default. The paths containing space characters must be enclosed in quotes.

**`<Icon>: (Optional character string)`**

Name and path of the icon associated with the shortcut. The icon of the executable is used by default (or the icon associated with the type of file).
