## Syntax

`ControlInvisible(<Element used> [, <Type of animation> [, <Animation duration>]])`
---

**`<Element used>: (Name of the control or name of a group of controls)`**

Name of the control or group of controls that must be made invisible.

**`<Type of animation>: (Optional Integer constant)`**

Type of animation to play:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *animCoverDown* | The new element appears from the top and covers the initial element. |
| *animCoverFromCenter* | The new element appears from the center and covers the initial element. |
| *animCoverFromCorners* | The new element appears from the corners and covers the initial element. |
| *animCoverLeft* | The new element appears from the right and covers the initial element. |
| *animCoverRight* | The new element appears from the left and covers the initial element. |
| *animCoverUp* | The new element appears from the bottom and covers the initial element. |
| *animFadeIn* | Fade-in animation. |
| *animFlipDownwardDiagonal* | Flip around the diagonal that goes from the top left to the bottom right. |
| *animFlipUpwardDiagonal* | Flip around the diagonal that goes from the top right to the bottom left. |
| *animShrinkAndCoverFromCorners* | The initial element shrinks and the new element appears from the corners. |
| *animSlideDown* | Scroll to the bottom. |
| *animSlideLeft* | Slide left. |
| *animSlideRight* | Slide right. |
| *animSlideUp* | Slide up. |





![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png)![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) This parameter is ignored. No animation can be played when the control is made invisible.

**`<Animation duration>: (Optional integer)`**

Duration of animation in hundredths of a second. This parameter can correspond to: 

- an integer corresponding to the number of hundredths of a second,

- a Duration variable,

- the duration in a readable format (e.g., '1cs' or '10 ms'). 


We recommend that you use a short duration (up to 1 second).
The application is locked as long as the animation is not over. If the user clicks or preses a key, the animation is stopped and the controls are displayed in their final status.

### Animating a group of controls
<a name="animating_group_controls_ELTPARAGRAPHE000130"></a>

If &lt;Control name&gt; corresponds to a group of controls, the animation is played in the rectangle defined by the control at the top left and the one at the bottom right.

The controls that do not belong to the group of controls but found in this area will also be animated.
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>




### Special cases
<a name="special_cases_ELTPARAGRAPHE000140"></a>

- **ControlInvisible** has no effect if the control or the group of controls is not visible.

- The [Visible](../Proprietes/2510138.md) property can also be used to make controls invisible. This property cannot be used to play an animation during this operation. In Linux, the [Visible](../Proprietes/2510138.md) property and the **ControlInvisible** function are equivalent.
