Opens a modal WINDEV window.

**Open** is also used to:

- set the window position,

- pass parameters to the window.




When **Open** is called, the following events and actions are executed:

- the "Global declarations" event of the window,

- the "Initialization" events of the controls in the window (the order is undefined),

- the window "Initialization" event,

- the window is displayed (it becomes the current window).




For more details on the events associated with a window, see [Events associated with a window](../WDChamp/1010021.md).

**Remark**: The controls in the previous window are disabled.



![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) In Java, modal windows appear in the taskbar.

**Mobile platforms**: 

- **iOS and UWP**: **Open** is not available. Use [OpenMobileWindow](../WDLang1/1000021018.md) instead.

- **Android**: Using **Open** in Android is not recommended. We recommend that you use [OpenMobileWindow](../WDLang1/1000021018.md). If it is necessary to process the value returned by the window, use the "Close a child window" event of the calling window.




![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png)![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) This function is available only to simplify the Webification of WINDEV projects. In a WEBDEV site, this function has the same behavior as [PageDisplayDialog](../WDLang2/1000017124.md).

## Example


```wl
// Open and reposition the "EditWindow" window
// The Value1 and Value2 parameters are passed to the event
// "Global declarations" of "EditWindow"
// ReturnedValue will retrieve the returned value
// when the "EditWindow" window is closed
ReturnedValue = Open("EditWindow, 10, 15", Value1, Value2)
```
<a name="Example2"></a>

```wl
// Open a window at given position by using variables
x, y are int
x = MouseXPos(mpScreen)
y = MouseYPos(mpScreen)
Open(StringBuild("WIN_Popup,%1,%2", y, x))
```

## Syntax

`<Result> = Open(<Name of the window> [, <Parameter 1> [... [, <Parameter N>]]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Type corresponding to the retrieved value (optional))`**

Value returned by the popup window when it is closed. This value is returned:

- by the [RETURN](../Motscles/1510007.md) keyword in the window "Close" event,

- by the [Close](../WDLang1/3038018.md) function,

- by the [ReturnedValue](../Proprietes/2510134.md) property used before closing the window.




**`<Name of the window>: (String or window name)`**

Corresponds to: 

- the name of the window to be opened.

- the name and full path of the window (".WDW" file) to be opened.




By default, the window is displayed according to the position defined in the editor. You can define the display position of the window. The window name is completed by the window display coordinates when opened. This parameter is of the form: 
```txt
"<Window name>, <Y>, <X>"
```
 where:

- &lt;Window name&gt;: name (or name and full path) of window to open.

- &lt;Y&gt;: Y-coordinate (in pixels) of window (in relation to the upper-left corner of the screen or parent window).

- &lt;X&gt;: X-coordinate (in pixels) of window (in relation to the upper-left corner of the screen or parent window).




Remark: The coordinates are ignored if the window is defined as centered in the editor.

**`<Parameter 1>: (Type of value sent to the window (optional))`**

First parameter that will be passed to the "Global declarations" event of the window to open. This parameter is passed by reference and is considered as a variable global to the window.



**`<Parameter N>: (Type of value sent to the window (optional))`**

Nth parameter that must be passed to the "Global declarations" event of the window to open. This parameter is passed by reference and is considered as a variable global to the window.

## Remarks


### Parameters passed to the window to open
<a name="parameters_passed_the_window_open_ELTPARAGRAPHE000159"></a>

The parameters are retrieved in the "Global declarations" event of the window. Simply write the following line of code at the start of the event:

```txt
PROCEDURE <Window name>(<Parameter1> [, <Parameter2> [, ...]])
```

For more details, see [Window with parameters](../WDChamp/1010026.md).


<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Window opening mode
<a name="window_opening_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000184"></a>

The window is opened in modal mode:

- the result of **Open** will be known once the window is closed,

- the user will not be able to click in one of the parent windows of the current window.




To manage modeless windows, use [OpenChild](../WDLang1/3038021.md) or [OpenSister](../WDLang1/3038045.md).

To manage MDI, use [MDIOpen](../WDLang1/3052005.md).
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Number of opened windows
<a name="number_opened_windows_ELTPARAGRAPHE000211"></a>

The number of windows that can be opened simultaneously depends on the available memory.
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Closing a window
<a name="closing_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000220"></a>

A window opened with **Open** can be closed with [Close](../WDLang1/3038018.md) (without parameters) from any event associated with the window or a control in the window.

If a parent window is closed, its child windows are also closed.
<a name="NOTE0_5"></a>


### Title of the window to be opened
<a name="title_the_window_opened_ELTPARAGRAPHE000236"></a>

By default, the window title is the one defined in the editor.

To change the window title, use [NextTitle](../WDLang1/3038043.md) or [CurrentTitle](../WDLang1/3038023.md).

### Minimized window
<a name="minimized_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000255"></a>

If the current window is minimized, the entire project is minimized.

The displayed icon is:

- the one of the current window if the current window has an icon, 

- the one of the current project if the current window has no icon.

### Opening the window of a component
<a name="opening_the_window_component_ELTPARAGRAPHE000271"></a>To open the window of a component, simply use the name of the component window (component included in the project). For example:

```wl
Open(ComponentWindow)
```
If a conflict occurs with a project element, the name of the element must be prefixed by the name of the component. For example:

```wl
Open(MyComponent.Window)
```
To use the name of the window in a variable, specify the name of the component. For example:

```wl
sWindow is string = "MyComponent.MyWindow"
Open(sWindow)
```


<a name="XComponent"></a>

## Component:
