Displays a message in a standard non-blocking dialog box with the answers "OK" and "Cancel" and calls a WLanguage procedure with the user's response. 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=fonctions_dialogue%20-%20HC%20N%B0006.gif)


Remarks: 

- **This is a non-blocking dialog box**. The WLanguage code that follows the call to **OKCancelAsynchronous** continues to run. To close the window, the user must validate one of the buttons. When the user clicks one of the buttons, the code of a WLanguage procedure is run.

- In the WLanguage code following the call to the function, another modal window cannot be opened before closing the dialog box. 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) WINDEV allows you to apply the skin template of your project to this dialog box. For more details, see [Customizing dialog boxes](../WDLang1/3021003.md).

### Line break in the dialog box
<a name="line_break_the_dialog_box_ELTPARAGRAPHE000086"></a>The CR string (Carriage Return) can be used to force a break to the next line. For example:


```wl
OKCancelAsynchronous("Caution: you are going to delete this record" + CR + ...
	"Do you want to continue?", MyProcedure)
```


You also have the ability to use the syntax of multiline strings. For example: 

```wl
OKCancelAsynchronous(
[
Caution: you are going to delete this record.

Do you want to continue?
], Procedure_OKCancelAsynchronous)
```
