| **twrError** | Stops the unit test and writes an information into its status report. | [TestWriteResult](../WDLang1/1000013001.md) |
| **twrInfo** | Writes an information into the status report of a unit test, in the test editor. | [TestWriteResult](../WDLang1/1000013001.md) |
| **twrCallingProcess** | Used to write a custom check procedure.<br>When **TestWriteResult** is called from the custom procedure, the results of **TestWriteResult** will be referenced in the call to the custom procedure (and not in the call to **TestWriteResult**).<br>Therefore, a double click performed in the results of the test will open the code editor on the call to the custom check procedure. | [TestWriteResult](../WDLang1/1000013001.md) |
