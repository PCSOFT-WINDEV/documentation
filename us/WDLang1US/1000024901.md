Checks whether a character string starts: 

- with a specific character string. 

- with one of the character strings in an array.

## Example


```wl
// Checks whether the response received from a Web server corresponds to a known response
MyResponse is string 
MyResponse = HTTPGetResult()
IF MyResponse.StartsWith("HTTP/1.0 20") <> 0 THEN
	ProcessSuccessResponse(MyResponse)
END
```

## Syntax

### Checking whether a character string starts with a specified string

`<Result> = <Initial string>.StartsWith(<Search string> [, <Search options>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**



- Size of the corresponding element in the initial string, 

- 0 if &lt;Initial string&gt; does not start with &lt;Search string&gt;.




**`<Initial string>: (Character string)`**

Text in which the first characters must be checked.

**`<Search string>: (Character string)`**

Text to be searched at the beginning of &lt;Initial string&gt;.

**`<Search options>: (Optional Integer constant (combination of constants))`**

Comparison options used to search for the &lt;Search string&gt; in the &lt;Initial string&gt;:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *ccIgnoreAccent* | Searches by comparing strings, ignoring accents. |
| *ccIgnoreCase* | Searches by comparing strings, ignoring the case (uppercase/lowercase characters). |
| *ccIgnoreInsideSpace* | Searches by comparing strings, ignoring spaces within the strings. <br><br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This constant is not available. |
| *ccIgnorePunctuationAndSpace* | Searches by comparing strings, ignoring punctuation and spaces (for more details, see Notes). |
| *ccIgnoreSpace* | Compares strings ignoring spaces before and after the strings. |
| *ccNormal*<br>(Default value) | Searches by performing a standard comparison between strings, similar to the '=' operator. |

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**

**`<Initial string>: (Character string)`**

Text in which the first characters must be checked.

**`<Search strings>: (Array)`**

Elements to be searched at the beginning of &lt;Initial string&gt;. This parameter can correspond to: 

- an array of character strings (in the following format: ["string1", "string2", "string3"]

- an "array of character strings" variable.




**`<Search options>: (Optional Integer constant (combination of constants))`**

## Remarks


### Characters taken into account for punctuation and spaces
<a name="characters_taken_into_account_for_punctuation_and_spaces_ELTPARAGRAPHE000332"></a>The characters taken into account for punctuation and spaces are provided by the system. To get the list of these characters, write the following WLanguage code:

```wl
s is string
FOR i = 0 TO 255
	IF Charact(i) <> StringFormat(Charact(i), ccIgnorePunctuationAndSpace) THEN
		 s += Charact(i)
	END
END

### &lt;String type&gt;.StartsWith and UNICODE
<a name="docparampagetitleshort_and_unicode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000348"></a>

You have the ability to use ANSI strings, Unicode strings and buffers in the different parameters of the function.

The following conversion rule is used for the Ansi systems (Windows or Linux):

- If at least one of the strings is a buffer, all the strings are converted to buffers and the operation is performed with buffers.

- If the first condition is not met and there is at least one Unicode string, all the strings are converted to Unicode and the operation is performed in Unicode (the conversion is performed with the current character set, if necessary).

- Otherwise, the operation is performed in Ansi.




The conversion rule used for Unicode systems is as follows:

- If at least one of the strings is a buffer, all the strings are converted to buffers and the operation is performed with buffers.

- Otherwise, the operation is performed in Unicode.




For more details on UNICODE, see [Managing UNICODE](../WDLang1/3024038.md).

Reminder: The linguistic parameters used are defined during the call to [ChangeCharset](../WDLang1/3054001.md).
