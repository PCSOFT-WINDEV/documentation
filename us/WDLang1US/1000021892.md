`<Result> = SysLinkExtension(<Extension> , <Command> [, <User>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the association is performed,

**`<Extension>: (Character string)`**

Extension to link. 

**`<Command>: (Character string)`**

Command to run. This command has the following format: "FullPathOfExecutable %1"
where %1 represents the selected file to pass in argument. We advise you to enclose it between quotes to guarantee its proper execution.
Remark: This parameter can contain system shortcuts such as %systemroot%.

**`<User>: (Optional Integer constant)`**

The association between the application and the extension is saved in the registry. Two options are available: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *sysAllUsers* | The association will be taken into account for all the users of the current computer. <br><br>Remark: You must have the "Administrator" rights to run this operation. |
| *sysCurrentUser*<br>(Default value) | The association will be taken into account for the current user only. |
