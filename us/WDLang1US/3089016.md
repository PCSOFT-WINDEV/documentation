## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000150"></a>
Windows gives you the ability to schedule automatic tasks via the manager of scheduled tasks. A program can be run every Monday at 10:00 AM for example.

WINDEV and WEBDEV allow you to create and configure scheduled tasks from an application via scheduler management functions

### Overview
<a name="overview_ELTPARAGRAPHE000028"></a>

A scheduled task includes two elements:

- the task itself: program run, ...

- the triggers of the task, i.e., the events that will start the task (for example, every Monday at 3:00 PM)




The same task can be associated with several triggers.

To handle these two elements, WINDEV proposes:

- two structures ([ScheduledTask](../WDLang1/3089004.md) and [TriggerScheduledTask](../WDLang1/3089002.md)).

- several [WLanguage functions](../WDLang1/3089015.md) (starting with Scheduler).




When it is created, a scheduled task is run every Monday at 9:00 by default.

### Handling a scheduled task
<a name="handling_scheduled_task_ELTPARAGRAPHE000056"></a>

The associated structures enable you to add or modify a scheduled task.

For example, to add a scheduled task, you must:

1. Define the characteristics of the task with the [ScheduledTask](../WDLang1/3089004.md) structure.

2. Add the task with [SchedulerAddTask](../WDLang1/3089003.md).

3. Define the characteristics of each trigger associated with the task with the [TriggerScheduledTask](../WDLang1/3089002.md) structure.

4. Add the triggers of the task with [SchedulerAddTrigger](../WDLang1/3089001.md).




**Remarks**:

- To fill the ScheduledTask structure with the characteristics of a scheduled task, use [SchedulerTaskProperties](../WDLang1/3089011.md).

- To fill the TriggerScheduledTask structure with the characteristics of a scheduled task, use [SchedulerTriggerProperties](../WDLang1/3089010.md).

- To reinitialize one or more structures, use [SchedulerReset](../WDLang1/3089012.md).

- To create a scheduled task in Windows Vista (and later), you must have the "Administrator" rights on the computer where the scheduled task will be run.
