![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) This parameter is ignored. No animation can be played when the control is enabled.

**`<Animation duration>: (Optional integer or optional Duration)`**

Duration of animation in hundredths of a second. This parameter can correspond to: 

- an integer corresponding to the number of hundredths of a second,

- a Duration variable,

- the duration in a readable format (e.g., '1cs' or '10 ms'). 


We recommend that you use a short duration (up to 1 second).
The application is locked as long as the animation is not over. If the user clicks or preses a key, the animation is stopped and the controls are displayed in their final status.![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) This parameter is ignored.

### Animating a group of controls
<a name="animating_group_controls_ELTPARAGRAPHE000124"></a>

If &lt;Control name&gt; corresponds to a group of controls, the animation is played in the rectangle defined by the control at the top left and the one at the bottom right.

The controls that do not belong to the group of controls but found in this area will also be animated.

### Special cases
<a name="special_cases_ELTPARAGRAPHE000133"></a>

- **ControlEnabled** has no effect if the control or the group of controls is not grayed out.

- The [State](../Proprietes/2510039.md) property can also be used to enable controls. This property cannot be used to play an animation during this operation. In WINDEV Mobile, the [State](../Proprietes/2510039.md) and **ControlEnabled** properties are equivalent.
