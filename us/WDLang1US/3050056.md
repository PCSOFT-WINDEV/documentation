## Syntax

`<Result> = FinFutureVal([<Initial capital> [, <Periodic Deposit> [, <Number of periods> [, <Rate> [, <Start>]]]]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Real or currency)`**

Future value of the investment.

**`<Initial capital>: (Optional real or currency)`**

Initial capital (0 by default).

**`<Periodic Deposit>: (Optional real or currency)`**

Periodic deposit (0 by default). This value is fixed for the entire duration of the operation. In most cases, this amount includes the capital and the interests.

**`<Number of periods>: (Optional integer)`**

Total number of periods for the operation (1 by default).

**`<Rate>: (Optional real)`**

Interest rate of investment expressed in percentage (1 by default). For example, for a 5% rate, this parameter will be set to 5. This rate cannot be null.

**`<Start>: (Optional boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the payments must be made at the beginning of period (default value),

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if the payments must be made at the end of period.

## Remarks




### Time unit
<a name="time_unit_ELTPARAGRAPHE000085"></a>

The calculations can be performed according to months or years. &lt;Rate&gt; and &lt;Period&gt; must correspond to the same unit.

Therefore, for monthly payments of a 5-year loan with a yearly interest rate set to 8%, use:

- &lt;Rate&gt; = 8% / 12, 

- &lt;Number of Periods&gt; = 5\*12




For the same loan with yearly payments, use:

- &lt;Rate&gt; = 8%, 

- &lt;Number of Periods&gt; = 5




For all the parameters, the payments are represented by a negative number while the collections are represented by a positive number.
