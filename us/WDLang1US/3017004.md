## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000237"></a>
Several WLanguage functions are used to manage the animations. You can:

- manage the animation in the Image controls and in the Static controls.

- animate the modification of controls. 

- animate the move from a window to another one.

## Animating the Image controls and the Static controls
<a name="animating_the_image_controls_and_the_static_controls_ELTTEXTE000261"></a>
These functions are used to manage the animation of an image in an Image control or the animation of a text in a Static control.


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [AnimationGetParameter](../WDLang1/3017003.md) | Reads the value of one of the animation parameters defined for an Image or Static control |
| [AnimationSetMode](../WDLang1/3017001.md) | Changes the type of animation for an image in an Image control or a text in a Static control (the parameters specific to the new type can be changed with [AnimationSetParameter](../WDLang1/3017002.md)) |
| [AnimationSetParameter](../WDLang1/3017002.md) | Changes the animation parameter for an image displayed in an Image control or for a text displayed in a Static control |
| [WinDisableEffect](../WDLang1/1000017172.md) | Disables the visual effects of the graphic engine of WINDEV (for a use in TSE mode for example). This function is useful when an application must be run on a computer with limited graphic capacities or for the TSE mode if the bandwidth is limited. |

## Animation of controls
<a name="animation_controls_ELTTEXTE000285"></a>
These functions are used to animate the modification of one or more controls by programming.




|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [AnimationEnabled](../WDLang1/1000017399.md) | Enables or disables the animations in the controls (animations defined in the project or by programming). |
| [AnimationMinFPS](../WDLang1/1000017400.md) | Configures the minimum number of images per second in order for the animations (transition effects) to be enabled in the controls. |
| [AnimationPlay](../WDLang1/1000017387.md) | Plays an animation when a control, a group of controls or a window is modified. |
| [AnimationPlayOnControlProperty](../WDLang1/1000017398.md) | Animates the modification of an integer property between 2 values. |
| [AnimationPrepare](../WDLang1/1000017386.md) | Prepares the animation on a control, a group of controls or a window. Then, the animation will be played by [AnimationPlay](../WDLang1/1000017387.md). |


Several functions are used to play an animation when the status of a control (or group of controls) changes:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [ControlEnabled](../WDLang1/1000017377.md) | Enables a control or a group of controls in a window. During this operation, an animation can be performed on the controls. |
| [ControlGrayed](../WDLang1/1000017375.md) | Grays a control or a group of controls. During this operation, an animation can be performed on the controls. |
| [ControlInvisible](../WDLang1/1000017369.md) | Makes a control (or a group of controls) invisible in a window. During this operation, an animation can be performed on the controls. |
| [ControlVisible](../WDLang1/1000017338.md) | Makes a control (or a group of controls) visible in a window. During this operation, an animation can be performed on the controls. |

## Animation of windows
<a name="animation_windows_ELTTEXTE000309"></a>
These functions allow you to animate the move from a window to another one. For more details, see [Animation of windows](../WDLang1/3038054.md).


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [WinAnimationClosing](../WDLang1/3038050.md) | Modifies the type and duration of the animation used when closing the application windows. |
| [WinAnimationNext](../WDLang1/3038052.md) | Modifies the type and duration of animations used when opening and closing the next window. |
| [WinAnimationOpening](../WDLang1/3038051.md) | Modifies the type and duration of animations used when opening the application windows. |
