<a name="Use"></a>
<a name="description"></a>
Evaluates the value of an expression built in a character string. 


<a name="Example1"></a>
<a name="sample_code"></a>

## Example


```wl
// Evaluate a formula
x,y are real
x = 1.5
Y = 5
Trace(EvaluateExpression("cos(x)+sin(y)"))
```

<a name="XSYNTAX"></a>

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = EvaluateExpression(<Expression>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Any type)`**



- **If the expression compiles without any errors**, result of the expression.

- **If the expression fails to compile**, if it does not return a value or if an error occurs during the evaluation, it triggers a fatal error.




**`<Expression>: (Character string)`**

Expression to evaluate.

## Remarks


### Local variables
<a name="local_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000042"></a>

The local variables of the current process can be used directly in the expression.
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Compiling the expression
<a name="compiling_the_expression_ELTPARAGRAPHE000049"></a>

The code is recompiled whenever **EvaluateExpression** is called. 

To avoid the compilation step, you can use [Compile](../WDLang1/3013015.md) and [Execute](../WDLang1/3013041.md) to build the code of a procedure, compile it once and run it several times. In this case, you will lose the ability to directly use local variables of the current process which will need to be replaced by parameters in the procedure.

### Using a procedure of external component
<a name="using_procedure_external_component_ELTPARAGRAPHE000066"></a>

The code is recompiled whenever **EvaluateExpression** is called. 

The call to a procedure of external component must name this procedure with its full name. 


```wl
EvaluateExpression("MyComponent.MySet.MyProcedure()"))
```

<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Dynamic code
<a name="dynamic_code_ELTPARAGRAPHE000079"></a>

The **constants cannot be used** in the dynamic code (defined by the [CONSTANT](../Motscles/1514012.md) keyword).

When using constants in a code, all the occurrences of the constants are replaced with their value during the compilation in the editor but the correspondence between the name of constants and their value is not "embedded" in the application. Therefore, the dynamic compilation cannot use the constants.

Let's see two alternatives:

1 - Use variables instead of constants: 


```wl
CONSTANT
	CST_Name = 1
END
```
becomes for example


```wl
CST_Name is int = 1
```
or

2 - In the string containing the code that must be compiled dynamically, replace the name of the constant by its value:


```wl
sCode is string
// In the string containing the code that will be compiled dynamically
// instead of leaving the name of the constant:
sCode=[
Info(CST_Name)
]
// Replace the name of the constant by its value
sCode = Replace(sCode, "CST_Name", CST_Name, WholeWord + IgnoreCase)
// The code can be compiled now
IF Compile("DynProc", sCode) <> "" THEN
	Error("Error while compiling the dynamic procedure: ", ...
		ErrorInfo())
ELSE
	// Then it can be run
	WHEN EXCEPTION IN 
		ExecuteProcess("DynProc", trtProcedure)
	DO
		Error("Error while running the dynamic procedure: ", ...
			ExceptionInfo())
	END
END
```
