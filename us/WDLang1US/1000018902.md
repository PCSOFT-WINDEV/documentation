**`<TreeMap control>: (Control name)`**

Name of TreeMap control to use.
If this parameter corresponds to an empty string (""), the control used will be the TreeMap control to which the current event belongs.

**`<Group path>: (Character string)`**

Path of the group to select. The separator of different path elements can be:

- the "\\" character. For example: "MyDirectory\\MyFile". 

- the "TAB" character. For example: "Desserts"+TAB+"Ice cream". 




This path has been specified when adding the element in the TreeMap control with [TreeMapAdd](../WDLang1/1000018814.md).

If this parameter corresponds to an empty string (""), no group is selected.
