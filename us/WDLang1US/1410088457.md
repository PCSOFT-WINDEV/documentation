The **diagConnectionPoint** type is used to define all the advanced characteristics of a connection point (i.e. point around a shape that a connector snaps to) in a Diagram Editor control. The characteristics of this connection point can be defined and changed using different WLanguage properties.

**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

## Example


```wl
N is int

// Create a rectangle shape
MyShape1 is diagRectangle
// Set the dimensions, position and background color
MyShape1.X = 100
MyShape1.Y = 100
MyShape1.Width = 50
MyShape1.Height = 50
MyShape1.Background.Color = PastelRed

// Reference the displayed diagram
MyDiagram is Diagram <- DIAGEDT_MyDiagram

// Add the rectangle shape to the diagram
N = Add(MyDiagram.Shape, MyShape1)

// Create an ellipse
MyShape2 is diagOval

// Set the dimensions, position and background color
MyShape2.X = 200
MyShape2.Y = 200
MyShape2.Width = 50
MyShape2.Height = 50
MyShape2.Background.Color = PastelGreen

// Add the ellipse to the diagram
Add(MyDiagram.Shape, MyShape2)

// Creates a connector
MyConnector is diagConnector
Add(MyDiagram.Shape, MyConnector)

// Reference added objects
MyShape1 <- MyDiagram.Shape[ N ]
MyShape2 <- MyDiagram.Shape[ N + 1 ]
MyConnector <- MyDiagram.Shape[ N + 2 ]

MyConnector.Beginning.ConnectionPoint = MyShape1.ConnectionPoint[1]
MyConnector.Beginning.ConnectionPoint.X = 100
MyConnector.Beginning.ConnectionPoint.Y = 50

MyConnector.Ending.ConnectionPoint = MyShape2.ConnectionPoint[1]
MyConnector.Ending.ConnectionPoint.X = 0
MyConnector.Ending.ConnectionPoint.Y = 50
```

## Properties


### Properties specific to diagConnectionPoint variables
<a name="properties_specific_diagconnectionpoint_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000027"></a>

The following properties can be used to handle a connection point:

| Property name | Type used | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shape | [diagShape](../WDLang1/1410088082.md) | Shape that contains the connection point.  |
| X | Real | X-coordinate of the connection point, expressed in pixels. |
| XPercent | Real | X-coordinate of the connection point, expressed as a percentage. |
| Y | Real | Y-coordinate of the connection point, expressed in pixels. |
| YPercent | Real | Y-coordinate of the connection point, expressed as a percentage. |

## Remarks


- Connectors can always snap to connection points created programmatically. 

- Multiple connectors can start from or end at a given connection point. 

- Shapes can have multiple connection points, accessible via the **ConnectionPoint** array of variables of type [diagShape](../WDLang1/1410088082.md). 

- Both ends of a connector can have a connection point.
