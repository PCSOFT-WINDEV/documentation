## Remarks


- By default, [&lt;Spreadsheet&gt;.Load](../WDLang1/1000023719.md) leaves the XLSX file open in write mode. When the document is saved, only the cells that have been changed in the Spreadsheet control are overwritten.. 

- To open the ".xlxs" file with another application, it must be closed with **&lt;Spreadsheet&gt;.Close**.

- If no ".xlsx" file was opened, **&lt;Spreadsheet&gt;.Close** has no action.

- This function can only be used on a Spreadsheet control found in a window.
