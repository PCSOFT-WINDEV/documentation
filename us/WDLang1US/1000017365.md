Seeks the index of an element in a WLanguage array. The following searches can be performed:

- Seek an element in a one-dimensional array of simple elements.

- Seek an element in a two-dimensional array of simple elements according to a column.

- Seek an element in a two-dimensional array of simple elements according to several columns.

- Seek an element in a one-dimensional array of structures or classes.

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Seek an element in an array of records.

- Seek an object in an array.




**Remarks**: 

- This function is equivalent to [ArraySeek](../WDLang1/3075002.md).

## Example


```wl
MyArray is array of 0 string
// Fill the array
Add(MyArray, "WINDEV")
Add(MyArray, "WEBDEV")
Add(MyArray, "WINDEV and WEBDEV")
// Find "WINDEV" 
ResIndex is int
ResSubscript = Seek(MyArray, asLinearFirst, "WINDEV")
Info("The WINDEV string is found at index: " + ResIndex)
// Returns: "The WINDEV string is found at index: 1"
```

## Syntax

### Seeking an element in a one-dimensional array of simple elements

`<Result> = Seek(<Array name> , <Type of search> , <Sought value> [, <Start index>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**



- Index of the sought element,

- -1 if the element is not found in the array.




**`<Array name>: (Array)`**

Name of the Array variable to use. This array must be a one-dimensional array.
This array can also correspond to an array of simple elements of an advanced variable.

**`<Type of search>: (Integer constant)`**

Type of search to perform:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *asBinary* | Binary search. <br>This search mode is fast but it must be used on an array sorted in ascending order, without duplicates (see [ArraySort](../WDLang1/3075007.md)). |
| *asLinear* | Linear search. The search starts:<br><br>- from the first element.<br><br>- from the value of the parameter &lt;Start index&gt;.<br><br><br>The search stops as soon as an element is found. |
| *asLinearFirst* | Linear search from the first element. &lt;Start index&gt; is ignored when this constant is specified. |
| *asLinearLast* | Linear search from the last element. This constant must not be used if &lt;Start index&gt; is specified. |
| *asLinearNext* | Linear search for the next element. This search is performed from the current position or the value of &lt;Start index&gt;. |
| *asLinearPrevious* | Linear search for the previous element. This search is performed from the current position or the value of &lt;Start index&gt;. |

The type of search can be combined with one or more search options:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *tccIgnoreAccent* | Search ignoring accented characters.<br>This option can only be used on the arrays of character strings.<br><br> |
| *tccIgnoreCase* | Search ignoring the case.<br>This option can only be used on the arrays of character strings. |
| *tccIgnoreInsideSpace* | Search ignoring spaces inside strings.<br>This option can only be used on the arrays of character strings. |
| *tccIgnorePonctuationAndSpace* | Search ignoring spaces and punctuation.<br>This option can only be used on the arrays of character strings.<br><br> |
| *tccIgnoreSpace* | Search ignoring spaces at the beginning and end of strings.<br>This option can only be used on the arrays of character strings. |
| *tccLexicographicOrder* | Array sorted according to the linguistic order.<br>This option is useful for a dichotomous search and it has no effect on a linear search.<br>This option can only be used on the arrays of character strings.<br><br> |
| *tccRespectNumeric* | Array sorted according to the order of numeric values.<br>This option is useful for a dichotomous search and it has no effect on a linear search.<br>This option can only be used on the arrays of character strings.<br><br> |

![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) The constants used to define the search options are not available.For a dichotomous search, the search options must be exactly the same as the options that were used to sort the array (see [ArraySort](../WDLang1/3075007.md)).

## Remarks


- This function cannot be used on the fixed arrays.

- This function can be used on the arrays of advanced variables. 

- This function cannot be used on the array of "Dynamic objects".

- This function can be used on the arrays of typed objects.

	- For example, no search can be performed in the following array:
			
		```wl
		t is array of 2 objects dynamic
		```


	- For example, a search can be performed in the following array:
			
		```wl
		t is array of 2 MyClass
		```

			
		```wl
		t is array of 2 MyClass dynamic
		```





- No search can be performed on an array of variants.

- No search can be performed on the Unicode strings.
	![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) If the type of the search is dichotomous and if the array is not sorted, no WLanguage error will be displayed but the result of the search will be undefined.
