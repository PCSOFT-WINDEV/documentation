## Remote check of a WINDEV application
<a name="remote_check_windev_application_ELTTEXTE000157"></a>
The remote control of a WINDEV application allows the manager of a network application to manage the automatic shutdown of the application for all the current users. The application shutdown may be required when updating the application or the database for example.

The remote check allows you to modify the operating mode of the application.

Several modes are available:

- **Standard operating mode of the application**: the application can be used as usual.

- **Forbid any new connection to the application**: a message is displayed whenever the application is run. The application cannot be started.

- **Warning of imminent application shutdown**: the message is displayed for all the connected users, at regular time intervals.

- **Immediate shutdown of the application**: a message is displayed and the application shuts down.

## Operating mode
<a name="operating_mode_ELTTEXTE000181"></a>
The management of remote control is performed via an INI file. This file contains the references of the different applications to check and, for each one of them, the characteristics of the check to perform (for more details, see [Structure of control file](../WDLang1/3013005.md)).

This control file (named WDUPDATE.NET by default) is created and maintained by [the WDADMINEXE application](../WDAdminExe/2028052.md). On a regular basis, the executable consults this control file and automatically triggers the action related to the specified modes.

The different steps for controlling the application are as follows:

1. The WDUPDATE.NET file is modified by the administrator of the application.

2. The WDUPDATE.NET file is regularly checked by the application.

3. If the mode is modified, the application automatically displays the corresponding messages (specified in the control file) on the user computers.




[Some examples of configuration.](../WDLang1/3013007.md)

| Mode | Effects on new users | Effects on users already connected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| New connection forbidden (*acForbidden* constant) | Displays a message for each new connection (this message can be configured).<br>This message can for instance indicate that the application is currently modified, and ask the users to retry later.<br>Without any user action, this message is automatically closed after a period of time (customizable). The application does not start. | No effect.<br>Standard use of the application. |
| Warning mode (*acWarning* constant) | Displays a message for each new connection (this message can be configured).<br>This message can for instance indicate that the application is currently modified, and ask the users to retry later.<br>Without any user action, this message is automatically closed after a period of time (customizable). The application does not start. | Displays a message at regular time interval (customizable message and timeout).<br>This message can for instance indicate that the application will be stopped for modification, and ask the users to complete their current task as soon as possible. |
| Shutdown mode (*acStop* constant) | Displays a message for each new connection (this message can be configured).<br>This message can for instance indicate that the application is currently modified, and ask the users to retry later.<br>Without any user action, this message is automatically closed after a period of time (customizable). The application does not start. | Displaying a message indicating that the application will be closed and closing the application (configurable message).<br>The application is closed. |

## Default operating mode and custom operating mode
<a name="default_operating_mode_and_custom_operating_mode_ELTTEXTE000205"></a>
By default, the windows displayed to the user are standard windows. These windows cannot be modified when the application is implemented.

No programming is required.

A custom operating mode can be implemented in two ways:

- [use an application window](../WDLang1/3013001.md) to display the warning messages, 

- [use an application procedure](../WDLang1/3013009.md) to customize the processes performed according to the different control modes of the application.
