Saves a dump of memory used by the application. A dump of the memory used by the application corresponds to a detailed description of elements in memory as well as the memory consumed by these elements. 

Unlike the dump file, the memory dump cannot be used to see the content of variables but only the memory footprint.

A memory dump can also be created by pressing Ctrl + Pause at any time

## Example


```wl
// Save the memory dump in the current runtime audit
dbgSaveMemoryDump()
```

<a name="XSYNTAX"></a>

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

### Saving the memory dump in the current dynamic audit

`dbgSaveMemoryDump()`
---





**Remark**: This syntax saves the memory dump in the dynamic audit file if the audit is enabled. The function has no effect if the dynamic audit is not enabled.
<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Saving the memory dump in a file or in interactive mode

`dbgSaveMemoryDump(<Name of dump file>)`
---

**`<Name of dump file>: (Character string)`**



- "?": starts the backup in interactive mode. 
	**If the dynamic audit is enabled**, the memory dump is saved in the dynamic audit file. 
	**If the dynamic audit is disabled**, a file picker allows the user to select the name of the file where the memory dump will be saved.
	In both cases, a confirmation message is displayed at the end of the operation. 

- Name of the file where the dump is saved. The name of the file can be built with the following elements:
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [%ExeDir%] | Directory of the executable, always filled with the "\\" character. This directory is equivalent to the result of [fExeDir](../WDLang1/3036049.md). |
| [%ExeName%] | Executable name. |
| [%Date%] | Start date of memory dump (YYYYMMDD format). |
| [%Time%] | Start time of the memory dump (HHMMSS format). |
| [%UserName%] | Name of the current user. |
| [%ComputerName%] | Computer name. |
| [%DataDir%] | Directory of the HFSQL data files specified by the user when installing the application. This directory is equivalent to the result of [fDataDir](../WDLang1/3036001.md). |
| [%DirUserData%] | Directory for the data of the current user of the current application.  This directory is equivalent to the result of [fDataDirUser](../WDLang1/3036071.md). |




If this parameter corresponds to an empty string (""): 

- The extension of the file will be ".wmem".

- the name of the created file corresponds to: "[%UserDataDir%][%ExeName%]_[%Date%]_[%Time%]". 
	For example: "C:\\Users\\Doc\\AppData\\Roaming\\WINDEV Applications\\MyApp\\MyApi_20161023_130812.wmem".




Caution: If you use the dynamic string construction ("Allow "[% %]" in the strings" in the "Compilation" tab of the project description), a compilation error occurs (unknown identifier). In this case, each string must be preceded by '-%'. Example: 

```wl
dbgSaveMemoryDump("[%UserDataDir%][%ExeName%]_[%Date%]_[%Time%]")
```
 becomes
```wl
dbgSaveMemoryDump(-%"[%UserDataDir%][%ExeName%]_[%Date%]_[%Time%]")
```
