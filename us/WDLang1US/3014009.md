## Example


```wl
hInst = LoadDLL("MyDLL.DLL")
IF hInst = 0 THEN
	Error("Error during the unload operation")
ELSE
	CallDLL32("MyDLL", "FunctionA", par1, par2)
	CallDLL32("MyDLL", "FunctionB", par1)
	FreeDLL(hInst)
END
```

## Syntax

`FreeDLL(<DLL Instance>)`
---

**`<DLL Instance>: (Integer)`**

Instance of the DLL to unload, returned by [LoadDLL](../WDLang1/3014006.md).

<a name="NOTE0_1"></a>

## Remarks
[API](../WDLang1/3014005.md) or [CallDLL32](../WDLang1/3014003.md) automatically loads the DLL if necessary, then unloads it (if it was loaded). This mechanism can be quite slow, except for the system DLLs (KERNEL, USER, GDI).

To optimize the execution speed, we advise you to load the DLL once with [LoadDLL](../WDLang1/3014006.md) and to unload it with **FreeDLL** when it is no longer used.
