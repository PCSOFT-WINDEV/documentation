## Overview

Several WINDEV functions can be used to handle the Windows registry.

The registry is a file used to store indexed information (classified by keys) describing the system hardware, the user preferences and the configuration settings.

**Handling the registry in Windows Vista**: 
In Windows Vista, if the [UAC mechanism](../Editeurs/2025014.md) is enabled, you must have administrator rights to write to the "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE" key.
If the user does not have the necessary rights, the UAC performs an automatic redirection to "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Classes\\VirtualStore\\MACHINE\\SOFTWARE. The purpose of this redirection is to ensure the compatibility of the applications. The keys written in this directory can be read by the application that has written them.  

**Reminder**: When creating the executable, a manifest can be included in the executable so that administrator rights are granted to the application.

Remark: 32-bit applications can also access the 64-bit Registry, and vice versa.

At the end of the evaluation period, the application is locked, unless the end user provides the code for unlocking the application

Each parameter is identified by a name. These values are saved at the location defined in the configuration window.<br>3°) The optimization<br>	This window explains how to optimize your code to avoid the slowness caused when the saved values are restored. Indeed, when restoring the value of a control, its modification code is run. If you have long processes (queries with parameters for instance), this window shows you how to speed up the loading of the window.
