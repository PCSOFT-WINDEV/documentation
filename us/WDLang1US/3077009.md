Creates an event. An event is used to synchronize several threads at the same time. If the event is open, all the threads waiting for the event are unlocked.

## Example


```wl
// Create an event
EventCreate("Let's go", eventManual, eventClose)
// Run a first thread
ThreadExecute("Thread1", threadNormal, "Thread_First")
// Locks the current thread until the event is obtained
ThreadWaitSignal()

// Run a second thread
ThreadExecute("Thread2", threadNormal, "Thread_Second")
// Locks the current thread until the event is obtained
ThreadWaitSignal()

// Modifies the event to run the threads
EventChange("Let's go", eventOpen)
```

```wl
//----------------------------------------------
PROCEDURE Thread_First()
Trace(dbgInfo(dbgProcess) + " - ThreadSendSignal(threadMain)")
ThreadSendSignal(threadMain)
EventWait("Let's go")
Trace(dbgInfo(dbgProcess) + " - Event received")
```

```wl
//--------------------------------------------
PROCEDURE Thread_Second()
Trace(dbgInfo(dbgProcess) + " - ThreadSendSignal(threadMain)")
ThreadSendSignal(threadMain)
EventWait("Let's go")
Trace(dbgInfo(dbgProcess) + " - Event received")
```

## Syntax

`EventCreate(<Event> [, <Mode> [, <Initial status> [, <Options>]]])`
---

**`<Event>: (Character string)`**

Name of the event to create. This name will be used by all the event management functions.

**`<Mode>: (Optional constant)`**

Mode for managing the event:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *eventAutomatic*<br>(Default value) | After its opening, the event is automatically closed as soon as a single thread is unlocked. |
| *eventManual* | The event is modified by [EventChange](../WDLang1/3077017.md). |



**`<Initial status>: (Optional constant)`**

Initial status of the event:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *eventClose*<br>(Default value) | The event is closed when it is created. |
| *eventOpen* | The event is open when it is created. |



**`<Options>: (Optional Integer constant)`**



- Mode for sharing the event:
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *shareGlobal* | The event is shared between all the applications found on the computer.<br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This constant is not available. |
| *shareNone* | The event is specific to the application. If [EventDestroy](../WDLang1/3077025.md) is not called, the event is destroyed at the end of the application.<br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) The events are unique to the application that created them. They cannot be shared between several applications. |
| *shareUser*<br>(Default value) | The event is shared between all the applications of the session of the user who runs the application.<br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This constant is not available. |






- Mode for destroying the event: 
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *DestructionWithoutModification* | By default, an event is automatically modified during its destruction. If the event is created with the *DestructionWithoutModification* constant, it will not be modified during the call to [EventDestroy](../WDLang1/3077025.md) or during the automatic destruction of the event when closing the application.<br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This constant is not available. |




The information regarding the share mode and the destruction mode of the event can be combined.

### Mode for sharing the events
<a name="mode_for_sharing_the_events_ELTPARAGRAPHE000164"></a>

In *shareUser* mode, the event is shared between all the applications of the session of the user who runs the application. 

- The event is created by the first application of the session of the user who calls **EventCreate**.   

- The following applications that call **EventCreate** connect to the existing semaphore.

- The last application that is closed destroys the event.

- An event with the same name cannot be used by a session of another user on the same computer: the system returns an error of access rights.




In *shareGlobal* mode, the event is shared among all the applications found on the computer.

- The event is created by the first application that calls **EventCreate**.   

- The following applications that call **EventCreate** connect to the existing semaphore.

- The last application that is closed destroys the event.
