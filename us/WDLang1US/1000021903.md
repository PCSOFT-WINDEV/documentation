## Remarks


- [AttachPointAdd](../WDLang1/1000021902.md) adds a new connection point.

- The [AttachPointEnd](../Proprietes/1000021908.md) and [AttachPointStart](../Proprietes/1000021907.md) properties allow you to handle these new connection points.

- As long as the control has no connection point, no wire can leave from the control or arrive to the control.
