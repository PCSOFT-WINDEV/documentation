## Remarks


- To navigate between the different internal windows added to the control, you can: 

	- perform a horizontal "scroll" in the control,
			![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) This feature is not available.

	- use [IWListPosition](../WDLang1/1000020562.md), [IWListNext](../WDLang1/1000020564.md) and/or [IWListPrevious](../WDLang1/1000020565.md).




- The added internal windows are numbered from 1 to x, according to the order in which they are added into the list. 

	- If an internal window is deleted by [IWListDelete](../WDLang1/1000020559.md), the internal windows that follow the deleted window are re-numbered. 

	- To insert an internal window into the list, use [IWListInsert](../WDLang1/1000020945.md). 




- To modify the internal window currently displayed by the control, use [ChangeSourceWindow](../WDLang1/3038053.md).

- **Parameters passed to the internal window**: Parameters are retrieved in the "Global declarations" event of the internal window. Simply write the following line of code at the start of the event:
	
	```txt
	PROCEDURE <Window name>(<Parameter1> [, <Parameter2> [, ...]])
	```

	For more details, see [Window with parameters](../WDChamp/1010026.md).
