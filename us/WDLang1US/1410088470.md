The **diagHead** type is used to define all the advanced characteristics of an end of a connector in a diagram. The characteristics of this end can be defined and changed using different WLanguage properties. 

**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

## Example


```wl
// Create a link between rectangle1 and rectangle2
rectangle1 is diagRectangle
rectangle2 is diagRectangle
Connector is diagConnector

Connector.Beginning.ConnectionPoint = rectangle1.ConnectionPoint(100, 50) 
Connector.Beginning.Drawing = shapeNone
Connector.Ending.ConnectionPoint = rectangle2.ConnectionPoint(0, 50) 
Connector.Beginning.Drawing = shapeTriangle
```

## Properties


### Properties specific to diagEnd variables
<a name="properties_specific_diagend_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000026"></a>

The following properties can be used to handle the end of a connector:

| Property name | Type used | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ConnectionPoint | [diagConnectionPoint](../WDLang1/1410088457.md) | Point the connector will snap to. |
| Drawing | Integer constant | Arrow drawing: <br><br>- *shapeNone*: The end has no particular shape. <br><br>- *shapeSquare*: The end is a square. <br><br>- *shapeRoundedSquare*: The end is a rounded square. <br><br>- *shapeArrow*: The end is an arrow. <br><br>- *shapeDiamond*: The end is a diamond. <br><br>- *shapeCircle*: The end is a circle. <br><br>- *shapeTriangle*: The end is a triangle. <br><br><br> |
| SnapMode | Integer constant | How the connector will snap to the target shape:  <br><br>- *connectorSnapToAuto*: The connection point is automatically determined according to the position of the connector and the shape. <br><br>- *connectorSnapToShape*: The end of the connector will snap to the center of the shape. <br><br>- *connectorSnapToConnectionPoint*: The connector will snap to a connection point. <br><br>- *connectorSnapToBoundingBox*: The end of the connector will snap to a point of the bounding box of the shape. <br><br><br> |
| X | Real | X-coordinate of the end in the diagram. |
| Y | Real | Y-coordinate of the end in the diagram. |
