Decrypts a message that was encrypted with a standard encryption algorithm. 

Unlike [Encrypt](../WDLang1/3024014.md) and [Decrypt](../WDLang1/3024035.md), [EncryptStandard](../WDLang1/1000021293.md) and **DecryptStandard** use the standard encryption algorithms that allow you to exchange encrypted messages between different runtime platforms (Windows, Linux, Android, Java, iOS, PHP, etc.) and/or with external tools.

## Example
<a class="notetitle" target="_blank" href="$DOC$=1000021295&name=decryptstandard_function&product=WD">See additional examples</a>

```wl
// Encrypt a character string by using the AES algorithm
sMessage is Buffer = "Message to encrypt"
sPassword is ANSI string = "password"
bufKey is Buffer = HashString(HA_MD5_128, sPassword)
bufEncrypt is Buffer = EncryptStandard(sMessage, bufKey, cryptAES128)
// Decryption 
bufResult is Buffer = DecryptStandard(bufEncrypt, bufKey, cryptAES128)
Info(bufResult)
```

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = DecryptStandard(<Encrypted message> , <Key> [, <Algorithm> [, <Operation mode> [, <Padding>]]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Binary buffer)`**



- Result of decryption for the specified message, 

- Empty string ("") if an error occurred. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md).




**`<Encrypted message>: (Binary buffer)`**

Message to decrypt. This message can be the encryption result obtained during the call to [EncryptStandard](../WDLang1/1000021293.md).

This buffer must include two sections: 

- The initialization vector (or IV) used to encrypt data.

- The encrypted data.




If the message was encrypted: 

- by [EncryptStandard](../WDLang1/1000021293.md), this parameter must correspond to the value returned by the function. 

- by an external tool, the buffer must be built by concatenating the encrypted data to initialization vector used.




Remark: if the specified operation mode is *cryptECB*, no initialization vector was used to encrypt the message and in this case, the parameter must directly correspond to the encrypted data.

**`<Key>: (Buffer)`**

Key with which the data was encrypted. This key must be identical to the one supplied when encrypting the message.

**`<Algorithm>: (Optional Integer constant)`**

Encryption algorithm used. This parameter must correspond to the algorithm used to encrypt the message.

**`<Operation mode>: (Optional Integer constant)`**

| *cryptECB* | Electronic Code Book - Dictionary of codes. This operation mode is not recommended and it should only be used for compatibility reasons. |



**`<Padding>: (Optional Integer constant)`**

Padding mode of encrypted data to be compatible with the size required by the encryption algorithms by blocks. This parameter must correspond to the fill mode used to encrypt the message.


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *cryptPaddingPKCS* <br>(Default value) | The data is filled with bytes whose value corresponds to the total number of bytes added to reach the requested size. |
| *cryptPaddingZero* | The data is filled with binary zeros until the requested size is reached. |
