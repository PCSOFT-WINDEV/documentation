The **diagSelection** type is used to define all the advanced characteristics of a point in a diagram. The characteristics of this point can be defined and changed using different WLanguage properties. 

**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

## Example


```wl
MyShape is diagPolygon

// Set dimensions, position ...
MyShape.Point[1].X = 0
MyShape.Point[1].Y = 0
MyShape.Point[2].X = 25
MyShape.Point[2].Y = 25
MyShape.Point[3].X = 50
MyShape.Point[3].Y = 75
MyShape.Point[4].X = 100
MyShape.Point[4].Y = 20

MyShape.X = 50
MyShape.Y = 100

MyShape.Width = 350
MyShape.Height = 150

MyShape.Open = True

// Reference the displayed diagram
MyDiagram is Diagram <- DIAGEDT_MyDiagram

// Add the rectangle shape to the diagram
Add(MyDiagram.Shape, MyShape)
```

## Properties


### WLanguage properties that can be used with the diagPoint type
<a name="wlanguage_properties_that_can_used_with_the_diagpoint_type_ELTPARAGRAPHE000025"></a>

The following properties can be used to handle **diagPoint** variables: 


| Property name | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| X | X-coordinate of the point, expressed in pixels. |
| XPercent | X-coordinate of the point, expressed as a percentage. |
| Y | Y-coordinate of the point, expressed in pixels. |
| YPercent | Y-coordinate of the point, expressed as a percentage. |


Remark: The initial value of a point is set to (0,0).
