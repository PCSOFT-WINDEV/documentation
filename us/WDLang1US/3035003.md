Allows you to find out whether a 32-bit application is already run.

**Remarks**: 

- If the executable is compiled in 64 bits, the function returns the status of a 64-bit process. 

- If the executable is compiled in 32 bits, the function returns the status of a 32-bit process even if a 64-bit Windows is run.

## Example

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![User code (UMC)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/MCU.png) 
```wl
NbRun is int
NbRun = ExeRunning("C:\WINDEV\PROGRAMS\WINDEV.EXE")
IF NbRun > 0 THEN
	Info("You are using WINDEV!")

## Syntax

### Finding out whether the specified executable is run

`<Result> = ExeRunning([<Executable name> [, <Option>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**



- Number of instances of the executable currently run. 

- 0 if the application is not started. 

- -1 if a problem occurred. For example: 

	- The user has no sufficient rights to list the processes in memory. 

	- The application could not access the system DLL used to enumerate the processes.







**`<Executable name>: (Optional character string)`**

Name and full path of executable (up to 260 characters). In this case, &lt;Result&gt; returns the instances of this specific application. 
Name of the executable (up to 260 characters). In this case, &lt;Result&gt; is the number of instances of the program (regardless of its initial path). 
If this parameter is not specified, the current executable is used. 
**Caution**: The executable must be a 32-bit application.

**`<Option>: (Integer constant)`**

Allows you to specify the type of instances to be counted: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *sysAllUsers* | Counts the instances of the executable launched by all users. |
| *sysCurrentUser* | Counts the instances of the executable launched by the current user.<br>**Caution**: If the process that calls **ExeRunning** was started by the user and involves an [elevation of privileges](../Editeurs/2025014.md), this constant is equivalent to the *sysAllUsers* constant.  |

### Finding out whether the specified PID is run

`<Result> = ExeRunning(<Executable PID>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**



- 1 if the application is started. 

- 0 if the application is not started.




**`<Executable PID>: (Integer)`**

PID (Process Identifier) of the executable.
