## Example


```wl
// Create an event
EventCreate("Let's go", eventManual, eventClose)
// Run a first thread
ThreadExecute("Thread1", threadNormal, "Thread_First")
// Locks the current thread until the event is obtained
ThreadWaitSignal()

// Run a second thread
ThreadExecute("Thread2", threadNormal, "Thread_Second")
// Locks the current thread until the event is obtained
ThreadWaitSignal()

// Modifies the event to run the threads
EventChange("Let's go", eventOpen)
```

```wl
//----------------------------------------------
PROCEDURE Thread_First()
Trace(dbgInfo(dbgProcess) + " - ThreadSendSignal(threadMain)")
ThreadSendSignal(threadMain)
EventWait("Let's go")
Trace(dbgInfo(dbgProcess) + " - Event received")
```

```wl
//--------------------------------------------
PROCEDURE Thread_Second()
Trace(dbgInfo(dbgProcess) + " - ThreadSendSignal(threadMain)")
ThreadSendSignal(threadMain)
EventWait("Let's go")
Trace(dbgInfo(dbgProcess) + " - Event received")
```

## Syntax

`EventChange(<Event> [, <New status>])`
---

**`<Event>: (Character string)`**

Name of the event to modify. If this event does not exist, it is automatically created with the default options (automatic mode) and in the specified status.

**`<New status>: (Optional constant)`**

Status of the event:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *eventClose* | Closes the event.<br>This constant is equivalent to [EventClose](../WDLang1/1000021272.md). |
| *eventOpen*<br>(Default value) | Opens the event. If threads are waiting for the event, they are automatically unlocked. <br>This constant is equivalent to [EventOpen](../WDLang1/1000021271.md). |
| *eventOpenAndClose* | Opens the event, unlocks all the pending threads and closes the event.<br>This constant is not recommended. It is kept for backward compatibility. |

| Value of EventChange | Automatic event (by default) | Manual event |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *eventOpen* | A single thread is processed by the event. <br>The event is automatically closed once the thread is processed. <br>**Pending threads**: If there is no pending thread, the event remains open until the next thread, then it is closed. <br>**New threads**: The new threads are added to the pending queue. | The event is opened. <br>**Pending threads**: All the pending threads are processed. <br>**New threads**: If other threads arrive while the event is still open, they are processed. |
| *eventOpenAndClose*<br>**This constant is not recommended. It is kept for backward compatibility.** | A single thread is processed by the event. <br>The event is automatically closed once the thread is processed. <br>**Pending threads**: If there is no pending thread, the event remains closed. <br>**New threads**: The new threads are added to the pending queue. | All the threads are processed by the event. <br>The event is automatically closed once all the threads are processed. <br>**New threads**: The new threads are added to the pending queue. |
| *eventClose* | The event remains closed. <br>**New threads**: The new threads are added to the pending queue. | The event is closed. <br>**New threads**: The new threads are added to the pending queue. |
