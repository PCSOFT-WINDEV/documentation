Converts a currency into another currency.

**Remark**: The converted currencies can differ from the Euro. For the conversions into Euros, use [eToCurrency](../WDLang1/3033001.md) and [eToEuro](../WDLang1/3033005.md).

## Syntax

`<Result> = eChangeCurrency(<Value to convert> , <Source currency> , <Destination currency> [, <Number of decimals> [, <Rounding difference>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Currency)`**

Value converted into the specified currency.



**`<Value to convert>: (Currency)`**

Amount to convert. This value is converted:

- from the &lt;Source Currency&gt; to the currency whose identifier is "0" (the Euro by default), 

- from the currency whose identifier is "0" (the Euro by default) to the &lt;Destination Currency>.






**`<Source currency>: (Integer or constant)`**

Identifier of the source currency or constant associated with the source currency (see the Notes).

**`<Destination currency>: (Integer or constant)`**

Identifier of the destination currency or constant associated with the destination currency (see the Notes).

**`<Number of decimals>: (Optional integer)`**

Number of decimal places used for the result of the conversion (2 by default).

**`<Rounding difference>: (Optional currency)`**

Variable retrieving the rounding difference caused by the conversion. This difference is expressed in the source currency.

### Exchange table
<a name="exchange_table_ELTPARAGRAPHE000092"></a>

An ***exchange table*** is stored in memory. Each currency is associated with:

- A currency number used to identify the currency by programming.

- A constant used to identify the currency by programming.

- A caption (up to 7 characters): this caption is displayed in the "Currency + Euro" control if the input mask allows it (the $ sign is indicated).

- An exchange rate. This exchange rate corresponds to the exchange rate of the currency in relation to the Euro.




This exchange table is as follows:

| Currency number | Constant | Country | Exchange rate | Default caption |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | *eEUR* | Euro zone | 1 | EURO |
| 1 | *eFRF* | France | 6.55957 | F |
| 2 | *eITL* | Italy | 1936.27 | ITL |
| 3 | *eBEF* | Belgium | 40.3399 | BEF |
| 4 | *eLUF* | Luxembourg | 40.3399 | LUF |
| 5 | *eDEM* | Germany | 1.95583 | DEM |
| 6 | *eATS* | Austria | 13.7603 | ATS |
| 8 | *eESP* | Spain | 166.386 | ESP |
| 9 | *eIEP* | Ireland | 0.787564 | IEP |
| 10 | *eNLG* | Netherlands | 2.20371 | NLG |
| 11 | *ePTE* | Portugal | 200.482 | PTE |
| 14 | *eGRD* | Greece | 340.750 | GRD |
| 15 | *eFIM* | Finland | 5.94573 | FIM |
| **Currencies not taking part in the Euro** |
|   |   |   |   |   |
| 7 | *eDKK* | Denmark | 0 | DKK |
| 12 | *eGBP* | Great Britain | 0 | GBP |
| 13 | *eSEK* | Sweden | 0 | SEK |
| 16 - 25 |   |   | 0 | Free1 to Free10 |
| 26 | *eCYP* | Cyprus | 0 | CYP |
| 27 | *eCZK* | Czech Republic | 0 | CZK |
| 28 | *eEEK* | Estonia | 0 | EEK |
| 29 | *eHUF* | Hungary | 0 | HUF |
| 30 | *eLTL* | Lithuania | 0 | LTL |
| 31 | *eLVL* | Latvia | 0 | LVL |
| 32 | *eMTL* | Malta | 0 | MTL |
| 33 | *ePLN* | Poland | 0 | SCH |
| 34 | *eSIT* | Slovenia | 0 | SIT |
| 35 | *eSKK* | Slovakia | 0 | SKK |

The first currency (whose identifier is set to 0) is the currency used as reference for the conversions.

In this exchange table, you have the ability to:

- add new currencies by modifying the custom currencies if necessary ("user-defined currencies" from 16 to 25) with [eInitCurrency](../WDLang1/3033003.md), 

- specify the exchange rate of each currency with [eInitCurrency](../WDLang1/3033003.md).




**Caution**: The currencies whose exchange rate is set to 0 will not be displayed in the context menu of the "Currency + Euro" control. To define the exchange rate of these currencies, you must redefine them in the initialization code of the project with [eInitCurrency](../WDLang1/3033003.md).

### Rounding difference
<a name="rounding_difference_ELTPARAGRAPHE000405"></a>

The &lt;Rounding difference&gt; is calculated by the following formula:


```txt
Round(<Value to convert>, <Result in source currency>, <Number of decimals>)
```


For example:


```wl
Difference is currency
ResConversion is currency
ResConversion = eChangeCurrency(1.52, eFRF, eDEM, 2, Difference)
```


ResConversion is set to 0.45 and Difference is set to 0.01.

The following line of code allows you to retrieve the initial amount:


```wl
InitialAmount = eChangeCurrency(ResConversion, eDEM, eFRF, 2) + Difference
```
