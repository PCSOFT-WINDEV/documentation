Enables the dynamic audit through programming.

The report of the dynamic audit is a ".waudit" file containing the invalid or abnormal behaviors, the time-consuming operations, ... For example:

- the assertions (even if they are not active).

- the non-fatal errors not processed.

- the fatal errors (exceptions), regardless they are processed by WHEN EXCEPTION or not.

- the execution warnings regarding the anomalies of the project (exceeding the capacity of a variable, ...).

- the execution warnings regarding the performance problems (resources found on a network and not found, ...).

- the custom execution comments and warnings.




**Remark**: If the project corresponding to the dynamic audit is opened in the editor, the audit file can be directly opened in the editor: 

- on the "Home" tab, in the "General" group, expand "Open", select "Open" and select the desired ".waudit" file.

- by performing a Drag and Drop of ".waudit" file from the file explorer to the editor.

## Example


```wl
// Enables the dynamic audit with all the options enabled
dbgEnableAudit()
```

## Syntax

`<Result> = dbgEnableAudit([<Name of audit file> [, <Options>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the dynamic audit was started, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise.




**`<Name of audit file>: (Optional character string)`**

Location and name of the audit file to create. The name and location of the audit file can be: 

- fully customized. 

- built using the following keywords: 
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [%ExeDir%] | Directory of the executable, always filled with the "\\" character. This directory is equivalent to the result of [fExeDir](../WDLang1/3036049.md). |
| [%ExeName%] | Executable name. |
| [%Date%] | Start date of the runtime audit (YYYYMMDD format). |
| [%Time%] | Start time of runtime audit (HHMMSS format). |
| [%UserName%] | Name of the current user. |
| [%ComputerName%] | Computer name. |
| [%DataDir%] | Directory of the HFSQL data files specified by the user when installing the application. This directory is equivalent to the result of [fDataDir](../WDLang1/3036001.md). |
| [%DirUserData%] | Directory for the data of the current user of the current application.  This directory is equivalent to the result of [fDataDirUser](../WDLang1/3036071.md). |





By default: 

- the extension of the audit file is ".wdaudit". 

- the name of the audit file corresponds to: "[%UserDataDir%][%ExeName%]_[%Date%]_[%Time%]". 
	For example: "C:\\Users\\Doc\\AppData\\Roaming\\WINDEV Applications\\MyApp\\MyApp_20071023_130812.waudit".




Caution: If you use the dynamic string construction ("Allow "[% %]" in the strings" in the "Compilation" tab of the project description), a compilation error occurs (unknown identifier). In this case, each string must be preceded by '-%'. Example: 

```wl
dbgEnableAudit("[%DirUserData%][%ExeName%]_[%Date%]_[%Time%]")
```
 becomes
```wl
dbgEnableAudit(-%"[%DirUserData%][%ExeName%]_[%Date%]_[%Time%]")
```


**`<Options>: (Optional Integer constant (or combination of constants))`**

Used to configure the options of the dynamic audit:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *AuditAll*<br>(Default value) | All the audit events are written into the dynamic audit. |
| *AuditAssertion* | The assertions are written into the dynamic audit. |
| *AuditComment* | The audit comments are written into the dynamic audit. An audit comment is written by [dbgWriteCommentAudit](../WDLang1/1000018839.md). |
| *AuditEnabled* | The dynamic audit is immediately enabled. |
| *AuditError* | The non-fatal errors not processed are written into the dynamic audit. |
| *AuditException* | The fatal errors, processed by WHEN EXCEPTION or not processed, are written into the dynamic audit. |
| *AuditPause* | The dynamic audit is initialized but it is not immediately enabled. It can be enabled thereafter by [dbgAuditStatus](../WDLang1/1000018836.md). |
| *AuditWarningAnomaly* | The execution warnings regarding the detected anomalies are written into the dynamic audit. |
| *AuditWarningPerformance* | The execution warnings regarding performance are registered in the dynamic audit. |
| *AuditWarningUser* | The custom execution warnings are written into the dynamic audit. A custom warning is triggered by [dbgWriteWarningAudit](../WDLang1/1000018838.md). |

## Remarks


### Operating mode of dynamic audit
<a name="operating_mode_dynamic_audit_ELTPARAGRAPHE000271"></a>

- **dbgEnableAudit** must be called only once. Any other call to this function will have no effect.

- To temporarily enable or disable the dynamic audit, use [dbgAuditStatus](../WDLang1/1000018836.md).

- To modify the options of the dynamic audit, use [dbgAuditOption](../WDLang1/1000018837.md).


![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) **Remark**: The dynamic audit can also be started via the ".wx" file next to the executable. For more details, see [Dynamic audit](../Editeurs/1014502.md).


### Miscellaneous
<a name="miscellaneous_ELTPARAGRAPHE000293"></a>

- **dbgEnableAudit** can be used in a REST webservice. 

- You can define any location for the audit file. In this case, keep in mind there may be permission-related issues. 
	Reminder: Generally, the data directory is accessible in write mode.
