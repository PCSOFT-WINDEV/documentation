## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000077"></a>
Hashing is used to summarize a file or a character string. This summary is called Hash. A single "hash" can be associated with a text in natural language: when the initial text is modified, the corresponding hash is also modified.

The hashing is mainly used to:

- check the integrity of a document when it is transmitted (the document is transmitted with the result of the hash).

- electronically sign a document (by encoding the hash result with a key for example).

## Hash functions

The hash functions are as follows:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [HashCheckFile](../WDLang1/1000007114.md) | Checks the Hash of a file for a specific type of algorithm. |
| [HashCheckString](../WDLang1/1000007113.md) | Checks the Hash of a character string for a specific type of algorithm. |
| [HashFile](../WDLang1/1000007112.md) | Calculates the Hash of a file according to a specific algorithm. |
| [HashString](../WDLang1/1000007111.md) | Calculates the Hash of a character string according to a specific algorithm. |





These functions are used to manage simple hashes as well as hashes with message authentication.
