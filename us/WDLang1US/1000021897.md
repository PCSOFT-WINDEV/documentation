<a name="description"></a>
Runs an action (defined through programming) with support for Undo/Redo. This function is linked to the "UI modification by end user" feature.

This function is mainly used when creating an editor through programming (see "Remarks").

## Example


```wl
WinEdDo(WIN_MyEditor, ProcCreateCap, "New")
INTERNAL PROCEDURE ProcCreateCap(sCap)
	pNew is Control
	pNew <- ControlCreate("STC_" + GetIdentifier(), typText, 150, 150, 80, 20)
	pNew.Caption = sCap 
	WinEdDeclareUndo(ProcCancel)
	INTERNAL PROCEDURE ProcCancel()
		ControlDelete(pNew)
	END
END
```

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`WinEdDo(<Window> , <WLanguage procedure> [, <Parameter 1> [... [, <Parameter N>]]])`
---

**`<Window>: (Window name)`**

Name of window or internal window to use. This window must be in modification mode ([WinEdActive](../WDLang1/1000021843.md)). 

**`<WLanguage procedure>: (Procedure name)`**

Name of WLanguage procedure to run. The code of this procedure must call [WinEdDeclareUndo](../WDLang1/1000021898.md). The actions of this procedure will be taken into account in Undo/Redo.

Remark: Using an internal procedure provides a direct access to the local variables. 

**`<Parameter 1>: (Any optional type)`**

First optional parameter that will be passed to the procedure.



**`<Parameter N>: (Any optional type)`**

Nth optional parameter that will be passed to the procedure.

## Remarks


### Use example
<a name="use_example_ELTPARAGRAPHE000049"></a>

**WinEdDo** is used to create custom actions (control creation for example) that support the undo/redo.

Let's take a simple example: creating an editor of graphic objects. 

A button is used to create a shape. The user must have the ability to cancel the shape creation. The following operations are performed: 

- Switching the window to modification mode ([WinEdActive](../WDLang1/1000021843.md)). 

- Calling **WinEdDo**. The procedure called by this function is used to create the shape. This procedure also contains the call to [WinEdDeclareUndo](../WDLang1/1000021898.md). [WinEdDeclareUndo](../WDLang1/1000021898.md) is used to define the behavior in case of user cancelation. 

- Switching the window to normal mode ([WinEdActive](../WDLang1/1000021843.md)). 




The end user can cancel this action (Ctrl + Z or call to [WinEdUndo](../WDLang1/1000021904.md)) and eventually redo it (Ctrl + Y or call to [WinEdRedo](../WDLang1/1000021905.md)).
