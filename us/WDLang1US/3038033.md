## Remarks




### Uppercase/Lowercase characters
<a name="uppercaselowercase_characters_ELTPARAGRAPHE000078"></a>

The window name can be written in uppercase or lowercase characters. The "~=" operator (flexible equality) should be used to compare the window name returned by **CurrentWin** with a hard-coded window name.

For example:


```wl
IF CurrentWin() ~= "EditWindow" THEN
	...
END
```

<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>




### Current window

The &lt;Result&gt; of **CurrentWin** depends on the event where **CurrentWin** is called:

| Calling event | Result of CurrentWin. |
| --- | --- |
| The window gains focus | Name of the current window (window that takes focus). |
| The window loses focus | Name of the current window (window that loses focus). |
| Resizing the window | Name of the current window (window is resized). |
| Initializing the window | Empty string (""). |
| Global declarations | Name of the previous window (window where the child window will be opened). |
| Closing the window | Name of the current window (window that is closed). |
| Initializing the control | <br><br>- Name of the previous window.<br><br>- An empty string ("") if there is no previous window.<br><br><br> |


To find out the window currently run, you have the ability to use the [MyWindow](../Motscles/1511004.md) keyword.
