## Syntax

`UnloadWDL(<Library Identifier>)`
---

**`<Library Identifier>: (Integer)`**

Identifier of the library to unload, returned by [LoadWDL](../WDLang1/3013020.md).  



<a name="NOTE0"></a>
<a name="NOTE0_1"></a>

## Remarks


- The main project library is always loaded and it cannot be unloaded.

- When a library is closed by **UnloadWDL**, the HFSQL files opened in the library are not automatically closed. In this case, any access to these HFSQL files will trigger the following error: "The xxx WDL was unloaded".
	It is recommended to use [HClose](../WDLang4/3044073.md) on open files of a library that is going to be unloaded.
