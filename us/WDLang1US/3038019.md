## Syntax

`InitWindow([<Initialization of controls>])`
---

**`<Initialization of controls>: (Optional boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> (default value) if the controls must be initialized to zero before running the initialization events of the controls, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if the controls must not be initialized to zero before running the initialization events of the controls.

## Remarks




### Events run
<a name="events_run_ELTPARAGRAPHE000079"></a>

**InitWindow** executes:

- the "Initializing" event of the window,

- the "Initializing" event of the window controls,

- The "End of initialization" event of the window. 




**InitWindow** does not run the event "Global declarations" of the window.

### Opening variable
<a name="opening_variable_ELTPARAGRAPHE000097"></a>

When the "Initializing" event of a control is run, the *Opening* variable is set to:

- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the execution of the "Initializing" event of the control was triggered when the window was opened,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if the execution of the "Initializing" control event was triggered by **InitWindow**.




Therefore, the execution of the control initialization events can depend on the value of the <u><u><u><u>Opening</u></u></u></u> variable.

### Miscellaneous
<a name="miscellaneous_ELTPARAGRAPHE000122"></a>

- The input is performed in the first control according to the tab order defined in the editor.

- **Caution**: Do not confuse **InitWindow** with [Reset](../WDLang1/3025026.md), which resets all the window controls (without running the "Initializing" event of the controls).
