<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`RTFAddLink(<Edit control> , <Start position of the link> , <End position of the link> , <WLanguage procedure> [, <Procedure parameter>])`

**`<Edit control>: (Character string)`**

Name of the RTF edit control to use.

**`<Start position of the link>: (Integer)`**

Position of the first character of the link. The index of the first character in the control is set to 1. The function has no effect if the start position of the link is greater than the size of the text. 

**`<End position of the link>: (Integer)`**

Position of the first character after the link. The function has no effect if the end position of the link is less than the start position of the link. 

**`<WLanguage procedure>: (Procedure name)`**

Name of the WLanguage procedure called when the link is clicked on.

**`<Procedure parameter>: (Optional variant)`**

Parameter that will be passed to the procedure when the link is clicked on. If this parameter is not specified, the procedure will receive no parameter.






## Remarks


- **RTFAddLink** can be used on standard and RTF Edit controls.

- To delete a link, all you have to do is reassign the corresponding text section.

- Links added with **RTFAddLink** are not kept: 

	- when copying to the clipboard.

	- when calling to [ScreenToFile](../WDLang4/3044146.md). In this case, only the RTF content is copied into the HFSQL buffer.




- In an RTF control, the line wraps correspond to a character. 

- You can set the color of links with [LinkColor](../WDLang1/1000022354.md).

- You can set the color of links added with **RTFAddLink** by using [LinkColorRTF](../WDLang1/1410087292.md).
