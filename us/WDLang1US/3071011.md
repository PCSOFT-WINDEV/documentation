Transforms the mouse cursor into hourglass (and conversely). This allows you to inform the user that a long process is performed by displaying an hourglass. The window is inactive as long as the hourglass is displayed: the user cannot click in the window.

### Miscellaneous
<a name="miscellaneous_ELTPARAGRAPHE000097"></a>

- To restore the cursor to its initial status: 

	- call **HourGlass(False)** as many times as **HourGlass(True)** was run.

	- use the *falseAllHourglass* constant. 




- When a WLanguage process ends, the cursor is automatically restored to its standard shape.
