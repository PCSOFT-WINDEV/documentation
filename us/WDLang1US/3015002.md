|   |   |

| [EndEvent](../WDLang1/3015010.md) | Cancels the interception of a Windows event on a WINDEV control or window (implemented by  [Event](../WDLang1/3015011.md)). |
| [EndTimer](../WDLang1/3015007.md) | Ends the execution of a timer triggered by [Timer](../WDLang1/3015008.md). |
| [EndTimerSys](../WDLang1/3015009.md) | Ends the execution of a timer triggered by [TimerSys](../WDLang1/3015006.md). |
| [Event](../WDLang1/3015011.md) | Intercepts a Windows event on a control, a group of controls or a WINDEV window. |
| [EventExist](../WDLang1/1000024424.md) | Indicates whether a specific procedure is run when a Windows event is sent to a control or window. |
| [Handle](../WDLang1/3015005.md) | Returns the system "Handle" (HWND) of a WINDEV control or window. |
| [HandleParentNext](../WDLang1/1000017312.md) | Forces the parent of the next window to open. |
| [Multitask](../WDLang1/3015004.md) | MultiTask is used to: <br><br>- define a timeout,<br><br>- give control back to Windows, <br><br>- give control back to Windows and to WLanguage.<br><br><br> |
| [PostMessage](../WDLang1/3015001.md) | Sends a Windows message to a control or to a window. |
| [SendMessage](../WDLang1/3015003.md) | Sends a Windows message to a control or to a window. |
