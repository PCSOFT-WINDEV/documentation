Returns the vertical position of the pointer (finger or stylus). The returned value depends on how the function is used:

- Used in an event linked to the movement of the pointer (click, move, pressed, released, etc.), returns the vertical position (Y) of the pointer (finger or stylus) in relation to the control or window. 

- Used in another event, returns the last known position of the pointer in the control.

- If the device supports the multi-touch movements, used to retrieve the position of a specific contact point.




Use cases: This allows you to find out: 

- the position of pointer (finger or stylus) during a click in an image (function used in the click code of image).

- the position of the pointer (finger or stylus) during its move on the surface of a control (function used in the optional event "Rollover" of a control).

- the position of the nth pointer during a multi-touch movement on the surface of a control (if it is supported by the device).

## Example


```wl
// Position of the pointer (finger or stylus) during a click in an Image control 
nY is int = GesturePosY()
```


<a name="Example2"></a>

```wl
// Position of the second pointer pressed on the surface of a control 
nY is int = GesturePosY(2)
```


<a name="Example3"></a>

```wl
// Position of the pointer in relation to the upper-left corner of the image displayed by the control
// when this image is not entirely displayed 
nY is int = GesturePosY(1, gpImage)
```

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = GesturePosY([<Pointer subscript> [, <Marker>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**



- Vertical position (or Y coordinate) in pixels of the pointer in relation to the relevant marker, 

- -1 if an error occurred.




**`<Pointer subscript>: (Optional integer)`**

Index of the pointer (finger) whose vertical position must be retrieved. The first pointer in contact with the screen corresponds to the subscript 1.
If this parameter is not specified, the function will return the position of the first pointer in contact with the screen. 
If the subscript does not correspond to a pointer in contact with the screen or if the specified subscript is greater than 1 and if the device does not support the multi-touch, the function will return -1.

**`<Marker>: (Optional Integer constant)`**

Marker used to calculate the position: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *gpControl* <br>(default value) | Position of the pointer in relation to the top left corner: <br><br>- of the control, <br><br>- of the window if the event is on the window.<br><br>- of the page if the event is on the page. <br><br><br> |
| *gpImage* | Position of the pointer in relation to the upper-left corner of the image displayed  by an Image control. <br><br>This constant can be used when an image is not entirely displayed in an Image control in order to find out the position of the pointer in the source image (while taking the possible zoom into account). <br><br>This constant should only be used when **GesturePosY** is called in an event associated with an Image control. Otherwise, **GesturePosY** will return -1. |
| *gpPage* | Position of the pointer in relation to the top left corner of the page to which belongs the control on which the event occurred.<br><br> |
| *gpScreen* | Position of the pointer in the screen (in relation to the top left corner of the screen). |
| *gpWindow* | Position of the pointer in relation to the top left corner of the window to which belongs the control on which the event occurred.<br><br> |

- To find out the horizontal position (X) of a pointer, use [GesturePosX](../WDLang1/1000019741.md).

- To find out the number of pointers in contact with the screen, use [GestureNbPointer](../WDLang1/1000019750.md).

- To find out the subscript of the pointer that triggered the execution of a process linked to a movement on the screen, use [GestureCurrentPointer](../WDLang1/1000019751.md).
