## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000122"></a>
WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile propose several methods for managing dates and times in your applications:

- Date or Time Edit controls.

- Date or Time items in the data files.

- [Date](../Motscles/1514066.md), [Time](../Motscles/1514068.md), [DateTime](../Motscles/1514070.md) and [Duration](../Motscles/1514069.md) variables.

- Properties associated with Date, Time, DateTime and Duration variables.

- [WLanguage functions for managing dates and times](../WDLang1/3027029.md).

## Different methods for managing dates and times
<a name="different_methods_for_managing_dates_and_times_ELTTEXTE000146"></a>
Depending on the type of operation performed on the dates and times, it may be more efficient to use WLanguage variables or functions.

The WLanguage functions are recommended:

- To format dates and times and perform conversion operations (convert a date to an integer, etc.).

- To get information about dates and times (date or time validity, get name of a week day, etc.).




The use of variables is recommended: 

- To perform calculations on dates and times (differences, calculation of duration, etc.).

- To extract part of the date or time (day, month, year, etc.).

### Date management and validity
<a name="date_management_and_validity_ELTPARAGRAPHE000060"></a>

The date storage format allows you to store dates from 01/01/0001 to 12/31/9999.

[WLanguage functions](../WDLang1/3027029.md) and [WLanguage properties](../Proprietes/2514010.md) make accurate calculations on dates from January 1st, 1583.

## Handling dates and times in Edit controls
<a name="handling_dates_and_times_edit_controls_ELTTEXTE000185"></a>
The values in the Edit controls can be managed with Date or Time variables.

To do so, assign the control content to the variable.


```wl
StartDate is Date
// Assign the content of the control to the variable
StartDate = EDT_DateControl
```
