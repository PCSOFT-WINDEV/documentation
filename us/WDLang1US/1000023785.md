## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = GesturePointerType([<Pointer>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**



- Pointer type used,

- -1 if an error occurred. 




The type of pointer can correspond to one of the following constants:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *typePointerFinger* | The pointer being used is the finger. |
| *typePointerMouse* | The pointer being used is the mouse. |
| *typePointerStylus* | The pointer being used is the stylus. |



**`<Pointer>: (Optional integer)`**

Pointer subscript to find out. The index of the first pointer is set to 1. 

- If this parameter is not specified, the function will return the position of the first pointer. 

- If the index does not correspond to a valid pointer, the function will return -1.

## Remarks


- **GesturePointerType** must be used in events that are linked to pointer movements: click, move, pointer pressed, pointer released, scroll, etc. If **GesturePointerType** is called in another event or process, &lt;Result&gt; will correspond to '-1'.

- To get the pointer index that triggered the execution of an event linked to a movement on the screen, use [GestureCurrentPointer](../WDLang1/1000019751.md).
