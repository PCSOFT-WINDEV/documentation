The **GanttTask** type is used to define the advanced characteristics of a task for a Gantt chart. The characteristics of this task can be defined and changed using different WLanguage properties. 

**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

## Example


```wl
NewTask1 is GanttTask
NewTask1.ID = "ID1"
NewTask1.DurationInHour = 0.10
NewTask1.Title = "Opening the trap"

NewTask2 is GanttTask
NewTask2.ID = 2
NewTask2.DurationInHour = 2.5
NewTask2.Title = "Launching the rocket"

// Adds the first task
GanttAddTask(COL_Gantt, NewTask1)

// Adds the task to the Table control by creating a new row
TableAddLine(TABLE_Example, NewTask2)

// Reorganizes the tasks in a Gantt Chart column
GanttOrganizeTask(COL_Gantt)
```

### Properties specific to GanttTask variables
<a name="properties_specific_gantttask_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000028"></a>

The following properties can be used to handle a task found in a Gantt chart:

| **Property name** | **Type used** | **Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Accountable | Character string | Accountable of the task. This information is not displayed in the Gantt chart. |
| BackgroundColor | Integer | Background color used to display the task in the Gantt Chart column.<br><br>This color can correspond to:<br><br>- an RGB color (returned by [RGB](../WDLang1/3029012.md)),<br><br>- an HSL color (returned by [HSL](../WDLang1/3029057.md)),<br><br>- a preset color (see [preset colors of WLanguage](../WDLang5/3010002.md)).<br><br><br><br><br>Before version 24, this property was named "BackgroundColor". |
| Cumulative | Boolean | Management of cumulative tasks: <br><br>- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>: the task is cumulative. The task includes an "arrow" marker at the beginning and at the end. This type of task is used to symbolize the global progress of several subordinate tasks.<br><br>- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>: the task is not cumulative.<br><br><br> |
| DurationInDay | Real, integer or numeric | Duration of the task expressed in working days. In this case, the end date (**EndDate** property) is calculated taking into account the working days.<br><br>**A duration must necessarily be specified.** <br><br>If the **DurationInDay** property is specified, the **DurationInHour** property must not be specified. |
| DurationInHour | Real, integer or numeric | Duration of the task expressed in working hours. In this case, the end date (**EndDate** property) is calculated taking into account the working hours.<br><br>**A duration must necessarily be specified.** <br><br>If the **DurationInHour** property is specified, the **DurationInDay** property must not be specified. |
| EndDate | Character string or DateTime variable | End date and time of the task. <br><br>This property is read-only. It is automatically calculated by taking into account the specified duration (in days or in hours), the working days and the working hours. <br><br>For example, if a task lasts 24 hours and if the working hours are defined from 8:00 to 20:00, the duration of the task will be set to 2 days in the Gantt Chart. |
| ID | Character string | Number used to identify the task.<br><br>**This property must be specified.** |
| Image | Image | Image displayed in the task (if the task uses the custom internal window, IW_WinDevViewGanttTask). This property can correspond to:<br><br>- the path to an image accessible from the current computer,<br><br>- an image file found in the application library,<br><br>- an Image control containing an image,<br><br>- a drawing performed in an Image control with the drawing functions and saved in memory.<br><br><br> |
| Milestone | Boolean | Management of Milestone tasks: <br><br>- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>: the task is a Milestone task. A milestone task is a tag used to symbolize an important event, an intermediate deadline. A milestone task is represented by a diamond, and it has no duration and no progress.<br><br>- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>: the task is not a Milestone task.<br><br><br> |
| Progress | Integer | Percentage of task progress (between 0 and 100). |
| ProgressColor | Integer | Color used to fill the progression bar of the task. This property is taken into account only if the value of the **Progress** property is not 0. <br><br>This color can correspond to:<br><br>- an RGB color (returned by [RGB](../WDLang1/3029012.md)),<br><br>- an HSL color (returned by [HSL](../WDLang1/3029057.md)),<br><br>- a preset color (see [preset colors of WLanguage](../WDLang5/3010002.md)).<br><br><br> |
| Row | Integer | Number of the row in the Table control where the task must be displayed. |
| StartDate | Character string or DateTime variable | Start date and time of the task.<br><br>If this property is not specified, the start date of the task corresponds to the system data and time. |
| Title | Character string | Task name. This name is displayed on the right of the task. |
| ToolTip | Character string | Text of the tooltip displayed on the task. <br><br>By default, this property corresponds to an empty string (""). |

### Using GanttTask variables
<a name="using_gantttask_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000207"></a>

The **GanttTask** variables are used by the following functions: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [GanttAddTask](../WDLang1/1000020904.md) | Adds a task in a Gantt Chart column in a Table or TreeView Table control. |
| [GanttGetTask](../WDLang1/1000021026.md) | Retrieves a task from its identifier in a Gantt Chart column (found in a Table or TreeView Table control). |
| [GanttListTask](../WDLang1/1000021073.md) | Returns: <br><br>- the list of tasks included between two given dates in a Gantt Chart column, <br><br>- all the tasks found in a Gantt Chart column,<br><br>- a specific task (selected or hovered). <br><br><br> |
