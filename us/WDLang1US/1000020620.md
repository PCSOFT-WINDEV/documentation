<a name="special_cases_ELTPARAGRAPHE000105"></a>

- To customize the title of popup for selecting the application, use [NextTitle](../WDLang1/3038043.md) before **StartShare**. 

- If only one application lets you share the resource on the mobile, the popup is not displayed and the application starts directly.
