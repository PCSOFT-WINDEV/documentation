After the synchronization, the destination directory and the source directory are identical. The comparison is based on the presence and on the date of the files. This can be very useful to manage the backups.<br>In this example, we will present the functions for handling the files on disk.<br><br>Summary of the example supplied with WINDEV:	<br>Select a source directory containing the files to save and a destination directory where these files will be saved. Start the synchronization. The application will compare the content of the two directories. If the file is not found, if the source file is more recent, then the file will be updated in the backup directory.
