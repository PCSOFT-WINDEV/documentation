## Remarks


### Use conditions
<a name="use_conditions_ELTPARAGRAPHE000434"></a>

**&lt;Table&gt;.ToExcel** can be used on: 

- Table or TreeView Table controls based on a data file.

- Table or TreeView Table controls populated programmatically.

- single-selection or multi-selection controls.



<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Miscellaneous
<a name="miscellaneous_ELTPARAGRAPHE000450"></a>

- The Excel files cannot exceed 65536 rows and 256 columns if the extension used is ".xls". This limit can be exceeded by using the ".xlsx" extension in order to create files in Excel 2007 format. Caution: in this case, the former versions of Excel must be equipped with the "Office 2007 compatibility pack", that can be downloaded from the Microsoft site in order to open the generated documents.

- The created file can be opened by Excel 97 (or later) or by OpenOffice Calc 2 (or later).

- It is possible to create XLSX files: You just need to specify the extension in the &lt;XLS file to create&gt; parameter.

- "High-Precision Numeric" columns (38 significant digits) will be exported as exponential numbers.

- The merge operation performed on the Table control columns is ignored.

- Unicode columns are exported in Unicode format to Excel.

- Check Box columns are exported as Check Boxes.

- RTF columns are exported without formatting.

- The following elements are not exported into the Excel file: 

	- The images,

	- The charts,

	- The bar codes.

### Printing in an XLS file
<a name="printing_xls_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000472"></a>

It is possible to print directly in an XLS file: 

- with the [iDestination](../WDLang5/3046074.md) function, 

- from the report viewer. 


The created XLS file is configured by [iParameterXLS](../WDLang5/1000017224.md).
