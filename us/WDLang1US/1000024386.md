The following functions are used to manage threads: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [&lt;AutomaticEvent variable&gt;.Close](../WDLang1/1000024383.md) | Closes a synchronization event between several threads. |
| [&lt;AutomaticEvent variable&gt;.Open](../WDLang1/1000024385.md) | Opens a synchronization event between several threads. |
| [&lt;AutomaticEvent variable&gt;.Wait](../WDLang1/1000024380.md) | Locks the current thread while waiting for the specified event to be opened. |
| [&lt;ManualEvent variable&gt;.Close](../WDLang1/1000024382.md) | Closes a synchronization event between several threads. |
| [&lt;ManualEvent variable&gt;.Open](../WDLang1/1000024384.md) | Opens a synchronization event between several threads. |
| [&lt;ManualEvent variable&gt;.Wait](../WDLang1/1000024381.md) | Locks the current thread while waiting for the specified event to be opened. |
| [&lt;Thread variable&gt;.Wait](../WDLang1/1000024880.md) | Waits for the end of the execution of the specified thread. |
| [&lt;Thread&gt;.RequestStop](../WDLang1/1000024924.md) | Sends a stop request to a thread. |
| [&lt;Thread&gt;.SendSignal](../WDLang1/1000024926.md) | The current thread sends a signal to the specified thread in order to unlock it. |





The following variables are available for managing events:

To use this example, a first instance of the example must be started in "server" mode. Then, by specifying the name of the computer that will be used as server and a nickname, you can connect to this application in "client" mode. You now have the ability to send messages to all the connected users. In this example, a thread and a socket are associated with each connection.

Then, you have the ability to perform multi-file transfers from the local computer to the server or from the FTP server to the local computer. To do so, we are using the standard functions of WLanguage (FTPConnect, etc...)
