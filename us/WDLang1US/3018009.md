## Syntax

`<Result> = TreeCount(<TreeView control> [, <Source node> [, <Elements taken into account>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**



- Number of elements found,

- -1 if an error occurred.

```txt
"<Root name>" + TAB + ["<Name of 1st node>" + TAB + ...
["<Name of 2nd node>" + TAB + [...]]]"<Leaf name>"
```


**`<Elements taken into account>: (Optional constant)`**

Level of elements to take into account in the count.
