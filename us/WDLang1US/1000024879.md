The **Thread** type allows you to define all the characteristics of a thread. The characteristics of this thread can be defined and changed using different WLanguage properties. 

**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

## Example


```wl
// Declare a variable to handle a thread
t is thread
// Build a thread and trigger its execution on a procedure
t = ThreadExecute(Proc, ("First parameter", 2))
```



```wl
// Build a thread
t is Thread(Proc, ("First parameter", 2))
// Trigger the execution of the thread
ThreadExecute(t)
```





## Declaration
<a name="declaration_ELTTEXTE000282"></a>
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

### Declaring a non-described thread

`MyVariable is Thread`
---

In this case, the thread is not described. The variable will have to be assigned with an existing thread or with the result of one of the thread execution functions.

### Describing a thread via the Thread type

`MyVariable is Thread (<Procedure> [, <Parameters> [, <Options>]])`
---

**`<Procedure>: (Character string or Procedure variable)`**

Procedure to run. This parameter can correspond to: 

- the name of the procedure to run. 

- the name of [Procedure](../Motscles/1000018907.md) variable corresponding to the procedure to run.




**`<Parameters>: (List of values enclosed in brackets and separated by commas)`**

Parameters of procedure to run. This list of parameters has the following format: 


```txt
(<Parameter 1>, ..., <Parameter N>)
```
where: 

- &lt;Parameter 1&gt;: First procedure parameter.

- ...

- &lt;Parameter N&gt;: Nth procedure parameter.




**`<Options>: (Optional Integer constant)`**

Mode for starting the thread.


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *threadFullCopyHFSQLContext*<br>(Default value) | Triggers the immediate copy of the current HFSQL context.<br>Recommended if the thread must take into account the current positions in the files and queries of caller context. |
| *threadGlobalContext* | Forces the use of the global context of the project if the thread is run from a window. The thread will continue to run until the application is closed.<br>The window context is used by default, therefore the thread is stopped when closing the window. |
| *threadLightCopyHFSQLContext* | Triggers the immediate copy of a part of the current HFSQL context. <br>The following elements are stored: <br><br>- the directories where the HFSQL Classic data files are located. <br><br>- HFSQL Client/Server connections.<br><br><br> |
| *threadNormal* | Starts the thread in normal mode. The HFSQL context is copied the first time an HFSQL feature is used. |
| *threadSecure* | Starts a thread in secure mode. In this mode: <br><br>- a compilation error will occur if the controls are accessed in the thread (or if the procedure uses the "UI" attribute). <br><br>- an exception will be thrown: <br><br>	- if the thread accesses the controls at runtime,<br><br>	- if the [ThreadStop](../WDLang1/3077019.md) function is called.<br><br><br><br><br>- when the window that triggered the thread is closed, a request to stop the thread is generated (but the thread continues to run after the window is closed). <br><br><br> |
| *threadWaitForStart* | Waits for the actual start of the thread before continuing the execution. |



**In this case, the thread is described and its description can no longer be modified.** 
The thread is not executed automatically, so a declaration alone will not start the execution of the thread. You must call one of the thread execution functions to start the thread execution.

### Properties specific to Thread variables
<a name="properties_specific_thread_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000114"></a>

The following properties can be used to handle a **Thread** variable:

| Property name | Type used | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Name | Character string | Thread name. <br><br>**This property is read-only**. |
| Priority | Integer constant | Current priority level of thread:<br><br>- *PriorityHigh*: High priority.<br><br>- *PriorityNormal*: Standard priority.<br><br>- *PriorityLow*: Low priority.<br><br><br><br><br>![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) Not available. |
| ReturnedValue | Value returned by the thread. | Caution: <br><br>- If the thread is still running, the **ReturnedValue** property blocks the execution until the thread terminates.<br><br>- If the thread terminates without a fatal error, the property returns the return value(s) of the main procedure of the thread.<br><br><br><br><br>**This property is read-only**. <br><br>Reminder:<br><br>- The **State** property is used to determine the state of the thread. <br><br>- It is possible to wait for the end of a thread with [ThreadWait](../WDLang1/3077020.md). <br><br><br> |
| Status | Integer constant | Thread status: <br><br>- *threadStopRequested*: Thread stop has been requested. <br><br>- *threadRunning*: The thread is running. <br><br>- *threadNotExecuted*: The thread has not been executed. <br><br>- *threadSuspended*: The thread is suspended. <br><br>- *threadEnded*: The thread exists but it has ended. <br><br><br><br><br>**This property is read-only**. |
| StopRequested | Boolean | <br><br>- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the thread was requested to stop, <br><br>- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. <br><br><br>**This property is read-only**. |

### WLanguage functions that use Thread variables
<a name="wlanguage_functions_that_use_thread_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000200"></a>




|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [ThreadExecute](../WDLang1/3077024.md) | Starts the execution of a secondary thread. |
| [ThreadRequestStop](../WDLang1/1000021218.md) | Sends a stop request to a thread. |
| [ThreadSendSignal](../WDLang1/3077021.md) | The current thread sends a signal to the specified thread in order to unlock it. |
| [ThreadWait](../WDLang1/3077020.md) | Waits for the end of the execution of the specified thread. |
