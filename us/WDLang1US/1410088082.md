The **diagShape** type is used to define all the advanced characteristics of the original shape used in a diagram. 

**CAUTION**: 

- A variable of type **diagShape** should not be assigned directly, and cannot be directly added to a diagram. Only the types that derive from this type of variable can be assigned or added to a diagram: 

	- [diagPath](../WDLang1/1410088384.md) variable, 

	- [diagGroup](../WDLang1/1410088127.md) variable, 

	- [diagImage](../WDLang1/1410088414.md) variable, 

	- [diagConnector](../WDLang1/1410088454.md) variable, 

	- [diagOval](../WDLang1/1410088135.md) variable, 

	- [diagPolygon](../WDLang1/1410088137.md) variable, 

	- [diagRectangle](../WDLang1/1410088083.md) variable.




- **diagShape** variables are used to handle the types of shapes, in particular arrays of shapes.

## Example


```wl
// Iterate over the shapes in a diagram
ShapeName is string
diagControl is Diagram <- DIAGEDT_DIAG

FOR EACH ShapeInDiagram OF diagControl.Shape
	ShapeName = ShapeInDiagram.Name // Gets the name of the shape
END
```

### Properties specific to diagShape variables
<a name="properties_specific_diagshape_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000050"></a>

The following properties can be used to handle an original shape:

| Property name | Type used | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ActionAllowed | [diagActionAllowed](../WDLang1/1410088840.md) or constant | <br><br>- [diagActionAllowed](../WDLang1/1410088840.md) variable used to define the changes the user can make to the shape.<br><br>- *diagActionNone* constant: no action available. <br><br>- *diagActionAll* constant (Default value): all actions are available. <br><br><br> |
| Angle | Real | Angle of rotation of the shape (in degrees). |
| Background | Constant, integer or [Color](../WDLang1/1000019661.md) | Background color of the shape. <br>The **Color** property is used to define the background color of the shape. <br>This property can correspond to: <br><br>- an RGB color (returned by [RGB](../WDLang1/3029012.md)),<br><br>- an HSL color (returned by [HSL](../WDLang1/3029057.md)),<br><br>- [a WLanguage preset color](../WDLang5/3010002.md).<br><br>- a variable of type [Color](../WDLang1/1000019661.md). In this case, the opacity specified in the variable is taken into account.<br><br><br> |
| Border | [diagBorder](../WDLang1/1410088179.md) | Characteristics of the shape border. <br>The available properties are: <br><br>- Color: border color. <br><br>- Thickness: border thickness. <br><br>- Type: border type.<br><br><br> |
| Comment | Character string | Note about the shape. This note is not displayed. |
| ConnectionPoint | Array of [diagConnectionPoint](../WDLang1/1410088457.md) | List of connection points of the shape. |
| Height | Real | Height of the box that contains the shape before rotation or zoom, expressed in pixels. |
| Name | Character string | Shape name. This name will be used for searching, for example, if the shape is in a library. |
| Note | Character string | Note associated with the shape. |
| Opacity | Integer | Percentage of opacity of the shape. This value ranges from invisible (0) to completely opaque (100). |
| Shadow | Boolean | <br><br>- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the shape has a shadow, <br><br>- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. <br><br><br> |
| Text | [diagText](../WDLang1/1410088393.md) | Text (with formatting) inside the shape. |
| Width | Real | Width of the box that contains the shape before rotation or zoom, expressed in pixels. |
| X | Real | X-coordinate of the box that contains the shape before rotation or zoom, expressed in pixels. This X-coordinate is relative to the parent of the shape. |
| Y | Real | Y-coordinate of the box that contains the shape before rotation or zoom, expressed in pixels. This Y-coordinate is relative to the parent of the shape. |
