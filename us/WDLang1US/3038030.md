## Syntax

### Identifying the window status

`<Result> = WinStatus([<Window used>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Constant)`**

Current status of window:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *Active* | Active window (window in edit, even if it does not have the focus). |
| *DisplayOnly* | Inactive window (this window is not in edit). |
| *Grayed* | The window controls are grayed. |
| *Invisible* | Window invisible on the screen and inactive. |
| *NotFound* | Window closed or not found. |
| *OutsideScreen* | Active window displayed outside the visible screen area.<br><br>![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) This constant is not available. |



**`<Window used>: (Optional window name or optional string)`**

Name or alias of the window to be used. 
If this parameter is not specified or if it corresponds to an empty string (""), the status of current window is returned.  


<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Modifying the window status

`<Result> = WinStatus(<Window used> , <Window status>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Constant)`**

Status after modification:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *Active* | Active window (window in edit). |
| *DisplayOnly* | Inactive window (this window is not in edit). |
| *Grayed* | The window controls are grayed. |
| *Invisible* | Window invisible on the screen and inactive.<br><br> |
| *NotFound* | Window closed or not found. |
| *OutsideScreen* | Active window displayed outside the visible screen area.<br><br>![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) This constant is not available. |



**`<Window used>: (Window name or string)`**

Name or alias of the window to be used. 
If this parameter corresponds to an empty string (""), the status of the current window is modified.

**`<Window status>: (Constant)`**

Specifies the new status and new positioning of the specified window. 
If this parameter corresponds to an empty string (""), the change of position (*Above*, *AboveAll*, *Normal* constant) for a window is canceled.


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *Above* | The window moves to the foreground in relation to the other application windows.<br><br>![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) This constant is not available. |
| *AboveAll* | The window moves to the foreground in relation to all other windows, even to the ones of the other applications. This constant is ignored for the MDI child windows displayed from a MDI parent window.<br><br>![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png)![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png)![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This constant is not available. |
| *Active* | The window becomes active (window in edit). |
| *DisplayOnly* | The window becomes inactive (no input is allowed in the window controls). |
| *Grayed* | The window controls are grayed. |
| *Invisible* | The window becomes invisible and inactive.<br><br> |
| *Normal* | A window in *AboveAll* mode switches to the normal mode (the windows of other applications can be displayed in the foreground). In the other cases, this constant has no effect.<br><br>![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) This constant is not available. |
| *NotFound* | The window is closed. A WLanguage error occurs if this window does not exist. |
| *OutsideScreen* | The window remains active but is positioned outside the visible screen area.<br><br>![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) This constant is not available. |
| *TopActive* | The window becomes active (window in edit) and it is displayed in the foreground. This constant corresponds to the result of a click performed in the title bar of window.<br><br>![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) This constant is not available. |

## Remarks


### Modal opening/Non-modal opening
<a name="modal_openingnonmodal_opening_ELTPARAGRAPHE000225"></a>

In modal opening (MDI parent window and MDI child window), **WinStatus** cannot be used:

- to make a parent window active.

- to display a child window "above" with the *Above* or *AboveAll* constant from an MDI parent window.




In modal opening, if a parent window is made invisible, the child window is also made invisible.

In non-modal opening, if a parent window with at least one child window is made invisible, the child windows are not made invisible.

### Differences between the Invisible and OutsideScreen constants
<a name="differences_between_the_invisible_and_outsidescreen_constants_ELTPARAGRAPHE000241"></a>

- If the type of a parent window is:

	- ***OutsideScreen***, this window is displayed in the list of Windows applications (accessible via Alt Tab).

	- ***Invisible***, this window is not displayed in the list of Windows applications (accessible via Alt + Tab).




- The coordinates of an ***OutsideScreen*** window are negative.

- Switching from:

	- ***Invisible*** to ***Active*** triggers the execution of processes for focus gain and focus loss in an incoherent way.

	- ***OutsideScreen*** to ***Active*** triggers the proper execution of processes for focus gain and focus loss.







**Tip**: You should use the *OutsideScreen* status rather than the *Invisible* status.

- If an *OutsideScreen* window is redisplayed by **WinStatus** with the *Active* constant, **WinStatus** does not set the focus to the window.

- If the *OutsideScreen* window did not have focus, it does not have focus after the call to **WinStatus**.

### Inactive or invisible window
<a name="inactive_invisible_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000271"></a>

If the current window becomes inactive or invisible, the "loss of focus" process of the window will be run before the change of status.


<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Closing the window
<a name="closing_the_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000282"></a>

The following code is used to close the window: 


```txt
WinStatus(<Window name>, NotFound)
```


This code is equivalent to [Close](../WDLang1/3038018.md).
