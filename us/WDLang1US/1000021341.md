## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = SpreadsheetSave(<Spreadsheet control> , <File to save> [, <Option> [, <Password>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the file of Spreadsheet control was saved,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) returns more details about the error. 




**`<Spreadsheet control>: (Control name)`**

Name of the Spreadsheet control to be used.

**`<File to save>: (Character string)`**

Name and full path of XLSX file where the content of Spreadsheet control will be saved. 

**`<Option>: (Optional Integer constant)`**

File save mode if the file already exists: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| 0 (or nothing)<br>(Default behavior) | If the XLSX file already exists and is not open (in the Spreadsheet control or another application), it is not saved. |
| *psheetOverwriteAllowed* | If the XLSX file already exists and is not open (in the Spreadsheet control or another application), it is overwritten. |



**`<Password>: (Optional character string)`**

## Remarks


- To open the ".xlxs" file saved with another application, it must be closed by [SpreadsheetClose](../WDLang1/1000021482.md). 

- The saved file can be reloaded in a Spreadsheet control via [SpreadsheetLoad](../WDLang1/1000021340.md) and [xlsOpen](../WDLang5/3080017.md).

- This function can only be used on a Spreadsheet control found in a window. 

- **SpreadsheetSave** updates the [FilePath](../Proprietes/1000023104.md) property of Spreadsheet control by associating the name of loaded file to the Spreadsheet control.
