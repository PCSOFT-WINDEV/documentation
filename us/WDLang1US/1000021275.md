The **ManualEvent** type is used to manage a manual event. A manual event is used to simplify the synchronization between several threads.

A manual event can only be modified by [EventChange](../WDLang1/3077017.md).

**Remark**: We recommend that you use an [AutomaticEvent](../WDLang1/1000021270.md) or **ManualEvent** variable to create an event rather than naming it using a character string. Indeed, using a variable allows you to: 

- manage the variable scope, 

- avoid having 2 events with the same name in 2 different threads.

## Example


```wl
// MAIN THREAD
//------------------
// Define the event
s is ManualEvent
// Start the thread
ThreadExecute("Thread", threadNormal, ProcThread, s)
// Code in parallel with the thread
...
// Wait for the event triggered by the thread
EventWait("s")
```

```wl
// SECONDARY THREAD
// ----------------------
PROCEDURE ProcThread(s)

// Code in the thread
...
// Unlocks the main thread
EventOpen(s)
```





## Declaration

<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

### Declaring a manual event (simple syntax)

`MyVariable is ManualEvent`
---

In this case, the manual event is closed when it is created.


<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Declaring a manual event (advanced syntax)

`MyVariable is ManualEvent(<Initial status>)`
---

**`<Initial status>: (Integer constant)`**

Initial status of the event:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *eventOpen* | The event is open when it is created. |
| *eventClose* | The event is closed when it is created. |

### Using the ManualEvent variables
<a name="using_the_manualevent_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000069"></a>

The **ManualEvent** variables can be used to synchronize threads in the functions: 

- standard syntax: 
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [EventClose](../WDLang1/1000021272.md) | Closes a synchronization event between several threads. |
| [EventOpen](../WDLang1/1000021271.md) | Opens a synchronization event between several threads. |
| [EventWait](../WDLang1/3077007.md) | Locks the current thread while waiting for the specified event to be opened. |

- prefix syntax: 
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [&lt;ManualEvent variable&gt;.Close](../WDLang1/1000024382.md) | Closes a synchronization event between several threads. |
| [&lt;ManualEvent variable&gt;.Open](../WDLang1/1000024384.md) | Opens a synchronization event between several threads. |
| [&lt;ManualEvent variable&gt;.Wait](../WDLang1/1000024381.md) | Locks the current thread while waiting for the specified event to be opened. |




During a call to [EventOpen](../WDLang1/1000021271.md) (or [&lt;ManualEvent variable&gt;.Open](../WDLang1/1000024384.md)), the event remains open: 

- all the pending threads are freed, 

- all the threads that will reach the event later will go through without waiting.


During a call to [EventClose](../WDLang1/1000021272.md) (or [&lt;ManualEvent variable&gt;.Close](../WDLang1/1000024382.md)), the event is closed: all the threads that will reach the event later will remain locked.
