## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000132"></a>
WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile propose several functions used to perform an advanced management of threads.

Threads allow running code (or processes) in parallel with the main application. Therefore, several processes can be run in the background without locking the main application.

Threads replace some types of timers.

An efficient thread is a thread that waits for an event such as a user action, an incoming email, an incoming phone call, etc.

**Examples for using threads:**

- Retrieving emails in the background while entering a new email, for example.

- Communication application: managing phone calls, communication via sockets, etc.

## From simple management to advanced management of threads
<a name="from_simple_management_advanced_management_threads_ELTTEXTE000156"></a>
WINDEV proposes several features for managing threads:

- Running threads. 
	For more details, see [Principle for running threads](../WDLang1/3077004.md)

- Managing the **semaphores** in the threads, which means limiting the simultaneous execution of a code by one or more threads at a given time. A semaphore can be shared between several applications. 
	For more details, see [Managing the semaphores in the threads: limiting the simultaneous code execution](../WDLang1/3077013.md). 

- Managing the **mutexes** in order to limit the simultaneous execution of a code to one thread at a given time. A mutex can be shared between several applications. 
	For more details, see [Managing mutexes in threads](../WDLang1/1000019475.md). 

- Managing the **critical sections** in order to limit the simultaneous execution of a code to **one thread** at a given time in a single application. 

- Managing **events** to synchronize several threads.
	 For more details, see [Synchronizing threads via events](../WDLang1/3077018.md).

To use this example, a first instance of the example must be started in "server" mode. Then, by specifying the name of the computer that will be used as server and a nickname, you can connect to this application in "client" mode. You now have the ability to send messages to all the connected users. In this example, a thread and a socket are associated with each connection.
