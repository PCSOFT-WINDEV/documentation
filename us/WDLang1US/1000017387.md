Plays an animation when a control, a group of controls or a window is modified.

The principle is as follows:

1. Call [AnimationPrepare](../WDLang1/1000017386.md).

2. Modify the controls in the code (fill, move, change of plane, etc.). These modifications are not displayed. These modifications will be displayed when **AnimationPlay** is called.

3. Use **AnimationPlay**. This function is used to switch from the "before modification" status to the "after modification" status by playing an animation.

## Example


```wl
// Prepare the animation
// The animation will be played in the window
AnimationPrepare(WIN_Customer, WIN_Customer.X, WIN_Customer.Y, ...
		WIN_Customer.Width, WIN_Customer.Height)
// Modify controls 
BTN_Down.Visible = False
IMG_Detail.Height += 50
WIN_Customer.Plane--
// Performs the modifications and plays the animation
AnimationPlay(animFadeIn)
```

## Syntax

`AnimationPlay(<Type of animation> [, <Animation duration>])`
---

**`<Type of animation>: (Integer constant)`**

Type of animation to play:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *animCoverDown* | The new element appears from the top and covers the initial element. |
| *animCoverFromCenter* | The new element appears from the center and covers the initial element.<br><br> |
| *animCoverFromCorners* | The new element appears from the corners and covers the initial element.<br><br> |
| *animCoverLeft* | The new element appears from the right and covers the initial element. |
| *animCoverRight* | The new element appears from the left and covers the initial element. |
| *animCoverUp* | The new element appears from the bottom and covers the initial element. |
| *animFadeIn* | Fade-in animation. |
| *animFlipAxisX* | Flip around the horizontal axis.<br><br> |
| *animFlipAxisY* | Flip around the vertical axis.<br><br> |
| *animFlipDownwardDiagonal* | Flip around the diagonal that goes from the top left to the bottom right.<br><br> |
| *animFlipUpwardDiagonal* | Flip around the diagonal that goes from the top right to the bottom left.<br><br> |
| *animShrinkAndCoverFromCorners* | The initial element shrinks and the new element appears from the corners.<br><br> |
| *animSlideDown* | Scroll to the bottom. |
| *animSlideLeft* | Slide left. |
| *animSlideRight* | Slide right. |
| *animSlideUp* | Slide up. |



**`<Animation duration>: (Optional integer or optional Duration)`**

Duration of animation in hundredths of a second. This parameter can correspond to: 

- an integer corresponding to the number of hundredths of a second,

- a Duration variable,

- the duration in a readable format (e.g., '1cs' or '10 ms'). 


We recommend that you use a short duration (up to 1 second).
The application is locked as long as the animation is not over. If the user clicks or preses a key, the animation is stopped and the controls are displayed in their final status.
**Remark**: The number of images played is adjusted according to the speed of the computer. Below a given number of images per second, the image is too jerky and the animation is canceled. The number of images per second is configured by [AnimationMinFPS](../WDLang1/1000017400.md).

## Remarks


- An error occurs if [AnimationPrepare](../WDLang1/1000017386.md) is called twice without a call to **AnimationPlay**.

- To avoid slowing down the window opening process, [AnimationPrepare](../WDLang1/1000017386.md) and **AnimationPlay** have no effect when they are used in the "Initializing" event of the window.

- [AnimationPrepare](../WDLang1/1000017386.md) and **AnimationPlay** have no effect: 

	- if "Enable the animation of controls on the project" is not checked. This option is available in the description window of the project, "Advanced" tab, "Animation of controls" button. 

	- or if [AnimationEnabled](../WDLang1/1000017399.md) was not called to enable the animations.
