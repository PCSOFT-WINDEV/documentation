## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000289"></a>
Error handling can be customized for each process.

No more "IF ... NOT", "IF ErrorOccurred ..." and other nested tests that made the code difficult to understand.

You can choose to use automated error processing or advanced management via the different WLanguage functions.

**Important**: The automatic management of errors and exceptions operates for the process for which it was defined.

### Implementing the automatic error handling
<a name="implementing_the_automatic_error_handling_ELTPARAGRAPHE000024"></a>

To implement the automatic error handling: 

1. In the code editor, open the event or process in which the errors will be handled: initialization code, click code, procedure, etc.

2. In the code header, clck "If Error: by program".

3. The window that is displayed allows you to specify the type of automatic process to perform:
	
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Erreur_auto2.gif&type=thumb)





**Remarks**:

- The code for managing the error found in the current process has priority over the automatic processes in the following cases:

	- Test of a function such as "IF NOT xxxx=True or False"

	- Test of errors with the [ErrorOccurred](../WDLang1/3087001.md) variable.
			![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) The management code of the error found in the current process does not have priority over the automatic processes: the error process of the code AND the automatic process will be run in any case.




- [ErrorChangeParameter](../WDLang1/3034009.md) can be used for advanced error management.

### Run the error process ("CASE ERROR:" in the code)
<a name="run_the_error_process_case_error_the_code_ELTPARAGRAPHE000056"></a>

If this option is selected, a line of code is added to the current code "CASE ERROR: ". The lines of code following this statement will be run when an error occurs in the previous lines of code. This option is recommended to group all the error processes that may occur.

**Remark**: If "ERROR CASE" is written directly in the code, the option "Run the error process ("CASE ERROR:" in the code)" will be automatically selected.
<a name="NOTE2_3"></a>


### Running a procedure for processing the error
<a name="running_procedure_for_processing_the_error_ELTPARAGRAPHE000067"></a>

If this option is selected, the specified procedure will be automatically run to process the error when an error occurs in the current process. This option is recommended if a procedure used to process the errors is already found in your application. This procedure will be automatically called when an error occurs. No test to run.

This procedure can return one of the constants found in the table below.

Depending on the constant returned, WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile will perform the corresponding process.


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| ***opCancel*** | The function that triggered the error returns an error and the code continues to run. |
| ***opEndProcess*** | The function that triggered the error returns an error and the current process stops. Equivalent to the following line of code:<br><br>IF NOT &lt;HFSQL function&gt; THEN SetFocusAndReturnToUserInput() |
| ***opEndProgram*** | The function that triggered the error returns an error and the program stops. Equivalent to the following line of code:<br><br>IF NOT &lt;Function&gt; THEN EndProgram() |
| ***opRelaunchProgram*** | Ends the application and automatically restarts the application.<br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This constant is not available. |
| ***opRetry*** | The function that triggered the error is re-run.<br><br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This constant is not available in Java. |

### Show error and exit application
<a name="show_error_and_exit_application_ELTPARAGRAPHE000110"></a>If this option is selected, the following window will be automatically displayed if an error occurs in the application:
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Erreur_auto_Fen1.gif)
This window allows the user to:

- Copy the error details to the clipboard (to transmit these details to the application provider for example)

- Stop the application

- Automatically restart the application once it has been stopped. This option is not available in Java.




![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) **Remark**: if the "Feedback" component is included in the application (directly or via the "?" menu), the error report can be sent to the application provider. 
<a name="NOTE2_5"></a>


### Show error and resume input in the current window
<a name="show_error_and_resume_input_the_current_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000127"></a>If this option is selected, the following window will be automatically displayed if an error occurs in the application:
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Erreur_auto_Fen2.gif)
This window allows the user to:

- Copy the error details to the clipboard (to transmit these details to the application provider for example)

- Stop the application

- Cancel the operation: the current process is canceled. The current window of the application is displayed.

- Automatically restart the application once it has been stopped.




![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) **Remark**: if the "Feedback" component is included in the application (directly or via the "?" menu), the error report can be sent to the application provider. 
<a name="NOTE2_6"></a>


### Display the error and let the user decide
<a name="display_the_error_and_let_the_user_decide_ELTPARAGRAPHE000145"></a>If this option is selected, the following window will be automatically displayed if an error occurs in the application:
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Erreur_auto_Fen3.gif)
This window allows the user to:

- Copy the error details to the clipboard (to transmit these details to the application provider for example)

- Stop the application

- Cancel the operation: the current process is canceled. The current window of the application is displayed.

- Retry the operation: the operation that triggered the error will be canceled then re-run.

- Automatically restart the application once it has been stopped. This option is not available in Java.




![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) **Remark**: if the "Feedback" component is included in the application (directly or via the "?" menu), the error report can be sent to the application provider. ![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This option and "Display the error and resume the input in the current window" have the same operating mode.
<a name="NOTE2_7"></a>


### Exit the procedure, return XXX and show the error
<a name="exit_the_procedure_return_xxx_and_show_the_error_ELTPARAGRAPHE000167"></a>

If this option is selected, RESULT XXX will be automatically performed when an error occurs in the code.

The following values can be returned:

- -1

- 0

- Empty string ("")

- FALSE

- NULL

- TRUE

## Customizing the windows for automatic management of errors
<a name="customizing_the_windows_for_automatic_management_errors_ELTTEXTE000373"></a>
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) By default, the windows for managing the errors, the exceptions and the assertions are included in the application. These windows are available in English and in French. 

To customize these windows (or to translate them), all you have to do is import the corresponding windows into your project:  

1. On the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, expand "Import" and select "WINDEV elements and their dependencies". 

2. Select the directory of the elements to import: "Programs\\Data\\Preset windows\\Assertion - Error - Exception". 

3. Select the windows to import: 
	

| WINDEV | Type of window |
| --- | --- |
| WD_DisplayAssert.wdw | Window for managing the assertions |
| WD_DisplayError.wdw | Window for managing the errors |
| WD_DisplayException.wdw | Windows for managing the exceptions |
| WD_ErrorTemplate.wdt | Template used by the WINDEV windows. |



4. Validate. The windows are included in your project. These windows will be automatically used and they will replace the default windows. 




**Remark**: To use the default windows, all you have to do is delete the imported windows from your project.

## Functions for automatic management of errors
<a name="functions_for_automatic_management_errors_ELTTEXTE000397"></a>
The functions for automatic management of errors are as follows: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [ErrorChangeParameter](../WDLang1/3034009.md) | Configures the automatic behavior that will be implemented if an error occurs in the current process. |
| [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) | Retrieves information about the last error that occurred in a function of a WINDEV, WINDEV Mobile or WEBDEV component. |
| [ErrorPropagate](../WDLang1/3034015.md) | Propagates a non-fatal error that can be processed by the calling code if the management of non-fatal errors was enabled for this code (in the code editor or by [ErrorChangeParameter](../WDLang1/3034009.md)). |
| [ErrorRestoreParameter](../WDLang1/3034012.md) | Restores the error process of a process. |
| [ErrorThrow](../WDLang1/3034011.md) | Throw a non-fatal error. |
