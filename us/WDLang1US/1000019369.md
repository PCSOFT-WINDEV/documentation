## Example


```wl
nOrientation is int
nOrientation = SensorGetOrientation(snrAzimuth)
IF ErrorOccurred = True THEN
	Error(ErrorInfo())
	RETURN
END
Info(StringBuild("Orientation of the phone in relation to the North: %1 degrees", nOrientation))
```
<a name="Example2"></a>

```wl
// Device in portrait mode or in landscape mode?
IF Abs(SensorGetOrientation(cptRoll)) < 45 THEN
	// Device in portrait mode	
ELSE
	// Device in landscape mode
END

// Device placed horizontally or vertically?
IF Abs(SensorGetOrientation(cptPitch)) < 45 THEN
	// Device placed horizontally
ELSE
	// Device placed vertically
END
```

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = SensorGetOrientation(<Orientation type>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**

Orientation of the device expressed in degrees according to the requested type of orientation. 

**`<Orientation type>: (Integer constant)`**

Type of orientation to return: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *snrAzimuth* | Orientation around the vertical axis (Z). |
| *snrPitch* | Orientation around the horizontal axis (X). |
| *snrRoll* | Orientation around the longitudinal axis (Y). |

## Remarks


### Device orientation: definitions
<a name="device_orientation_definitions_ELTPARAGRAPHE000079"></a>

The change of orientation can be specified according to the three following dimensions: 

- **Azimuth**: Direction of the device in relation to the magnetic North around the vertical axis (Z). This direction is expressed in degrees (from 0 to 360 degrees). In this case, 0 or 360 corresponds to the North, 90 corresponds to the East, 180 corresponds to the South and 270 corresponds to the West.

- **Pitch**: Rotation of the device around the horizontal axis (X). This rotation is expressed in degrees (from -180 to 180). Its value is set to 0 degree when the device lies down flat with the screen pointing to the ceiling, -90 degrees when the device stands still with the top of the device pointing to the ceiling, 90 degrees when the device stands still with the top of the device pointing to the ground and -180/180 degrees when the device lies down flat with the screen pointing to the ground.

- **Roll**: Rotation of the device around the longitudinal axis (Y). This rotation is expressed in degrees (from -90 to 90). Its value is set to 0 degree when the device lies down flat with the screen pointing to the ceiling, -90 degrees when the screen is oriented to the left and 90 degrees when the screen is oriented to the right.

System of coordinates (considering that the device lies down flat, the screen directed to the ceiling): 

- The origin is found in the lower-left corner of the screen. 

- The X-axis represents the horizontal axis and it points to the right of the screen. 

- The Y-axis represents the longitudinal axis and it points to the top of the screen. 

- The Z-axis represents the vertical axis and it points outside the front of the screen.
