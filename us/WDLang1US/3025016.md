Gets, modifies or restores the data binding to a control or group of controls.

**ControlAlias** does not change the contents of the control, it only changes the data binding. To update the controls with the values of the new data binding, use [FileToScreen](../WDLang4/3044210.md), [TableDisplay](../WDLang1/3074003.md), etc.

	From version <B><B><B>17</B></B></B>, ***FieldAlias*** is kept for backward compatibility. This function is replaced by ***ControlAlias***.

** is kept for backward compatibility: this function does not support the data binding. It is recommended to use the [DataBinding](../Proprietes/2510060.md) property.

## Syntax

### Getting the data binding of a control

`<Result> = ControlAlias(<Control used>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Character string)`**

Data binding to a specified control. The binding has the following syntax: 

```txt
"<Base file>.<Base item>[:<Binding>[:<Binding>]]"
```


where &lt;Binding&gt; corresponds to &lt;Related file&gt;.&lt;Key&gt;:&lt;Bound item&gt;[&lt;Index&gt;]

**`<Control used>: (Control name)`**

Name of the control to be used.  


<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Modifying the data binding of a control or group of controls

`<Result> = ControlAlias(<Element used> , <New binding>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**



- 0 if the modification was performed,

- an error code (value greater than 0) otherwise.




**`<Element used>: (Control name, control group name or window name)`**

Name of the control, group of controls, Tab control, Table control based on a data file, Table columns or window to be used. The data bindings of all the controls in the group, Tab control, Table control based on a data file, Table columns or window will be modified.



**`<New binding>: (Character string)`**

New data binding. If this parameter corresponds to an empty string (""), the data binding is canceled. This new binding may correspond to:

- a complex data binding: 
	"&lt;Base file&gt;.&lt;Base item&gt;[:&lt;Binding&gt;[:&lt;Binding&gt;]]"
	&lt;Binding&gt; corresponds to:
	&lt;Related file&gt;.&lt;Key&gt;:&lt;Bound item&gt;[&lt;Index&gt;]

- a simple data binding:
	"&lt;New base file&gt; = &lt;Current base file&gt;  





<a name="SYNTAX3"></a>

### Restoring the initial data binding of a control or group of controls

`<Result> = ControlAlias(<Element used> , <caRestore>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**



- 0 if the modification was performed,

- an error code (value greater than 0) otherwise.




**`<Element used>: (Control name, control group name or window name)`**

Name of the control, group of controls, Tab control, Table control based on a data file, Table columns or window to be used. The data bindings of all the controls in the group, Tab control, Table control based on a data file, Table columns or window will be restored.



**`<caRestore>: (Constant)`**

*caRestore*: Constant used to restore the initial data binding of a control or group of controls.

## Remarks




### Simple data binding
<a name="simple_data_binding_ELTPARAGRAPHE000126"></a>

A simple binding corresponds to the following syntax: "&lt;New base file&gt; = &lt;Current base file&gt;".

In this case, only the controls bound to the items of the &lt;Current base file&gt; will be modified and bound to the &lt;New base file&gt;.

For example, the line of code:


```wl
ControlAlias(WIN_Window, "CUSTOMER2001=CUSTOMER")
```


will rename the CUSTOMER file as CUSTOMER2001 for the controls whose base file is "CUSTOMER". The controls with a binding to another data file will not be modified.

### Complex data binding
<a name="complex_data_binding_ELTPARAGRAPHE000142"></a>

A complex binding corresponds to the following syntax:


```txt
"<Base file>.<Base item>[:<Binding>[:<Binding>]]"
```


where &lt;Binding&gt; corresponds to:


```txt
<Related file>.<Key>:<Bound item>[<Index>]
```

### Error code (syntax 2 and 3)
<a name="error_code_syntax_2_and_3_ELTPARAGRAPHE000159"></a>

If an error occurs,**ControlAlias** displays a message and returns the message error code:

- 1: Syntax error

- 2: Insufficient memory

- 3: HFSQL files not initialized

- 4: File not found

- 5: Item or file not found

- 6: Value of keys not found in the binding

- 7: Locked file or binding not found

- 10: File name too long

- 11: Item name too long

- 12: Too many bindings described

- 13: Index allowed on last item only

- 14: Index too high

- 15: Invalid index value

- 16:**ControlAlias** does not support this type of control

- 17: Description string too long

- 18: Bindings not allowed on a table based on a data file




If an error occurs when**ControlAlias** is called on a control, the previous binding does not change. If**ControlAlias** is assigned to a group of controls, the control on which the error occurs and the following controls are not modified.
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>




### Table control based on a data file
<a name="table_control_based_data_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000194"></a>

- On a Table control based on a data file, only the bindings to the following elements are allowed:

	- &lt;Base file&gt;

	- &lt;Base file&gt;.&lt;Base item&gt;




- &lt;Base item&gt; must correspond to a key item.

- The file is replaced for all the table columns.

- &lt;Base item&gt; applies to the table only.

- **ControlAlias** only changes the binding of the internal file to a Table control based on a data file.



<a name="NOTE0_5"></a>




### Limitations and special cases
<a name="limitations_and_special_cases_ELTPARAGRAPHE000211"></a>

- **ControlAlias** has no effect on Table controls (and columns) with in-memory data source, buttons and ActiveX controls.

- It may happen that no browse is currently performed on the HyperFileSQL data files when an alias or a search key is modified. Once the data bindings have been changed by**ControlAlias**, it is recommended to call:

	- [HReadFirst](../WDLang4/3044051.md) or [HReadSeek](../WDLang4/3044050.md) before [FileToScreen](../WDLang4/3044210.md), 

	- [TableDisplay](../WDLang1/3074003.md) for a Table control based on a data file.
