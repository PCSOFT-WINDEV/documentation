Modifies the type and duration of animations used when opening and closing the next window.

**Remarks**:

- To configure the animation that will be used when opening all windows, call [WinAnimationOpening](../WDLang1/3038051.md).

- To configure the animation that will be used when closing all windows, call [WinAnimationClosing](../WDLang1/3038050.md).

## Example


```wl
// Select the animation
WinAnimationNext(waRotationMulti, 200)
// Open the window with the specified animation
Open(WIN_AnimationTest)

...

// Close the window with the specified animation in reverse direction
Close(WIN_AnimationTest)
```

## Syntax

`WinAnimationNext(<Type of animation> [, <Duration> [, <Sound>]])`
---

**`<Type of animation>: (Constant)`**

Type of animation to perform. The animation is performed in reversed direction when the windows are closed.
These types are classified by category and they can be combined (except for *waDefault* and *waRandom*).

- Proposed by WINDEV:
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *waDefault* | Default animation proposed by WINDEV. <br>This constant cannot be combined with the other constants. |
| *waNone* | No animation is proposed |
| *waRandom* | A random animation is selected by WINDEV. <br>This constant cannot be combined with the other constants. |
| *waVista* | Windows Vista animation (combination of rotation, transparency and relocation). |



- Morphing:
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *waBook* | The plane of the window is displayed on a book that opens. |
| *waCircularFadeIn* | The window is displayed inside a disk whose size increases. |
| *waFountain* | The window appears bit by bit, as if coming out of a fountain. |
| *waInterleave* | The four corners of the window merge while inter-penetrating. |
| *waMorphCylinder* | The plane of the window is displayed on a cylinder that slowly changes into a plane. |
| *waMorphSphere* | The plane of the window is displayed on a sphere that slowly changes into a plane. |
| *waMorphWave* | The plane window is displayed on waves that fade away. |
| *waTopFilling* | The window fills from the top to the bottom. |



- Rotation:
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *waRotationMulti* | The window rotates around all axes |
| *waRotationX* | The window quickly rotates around the X-axis |
| *waRotationY* | The window slowly rotates around the Y-axis |
| *waZigZag* | Zig zag effect |



- Transparency:
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *waTransparent1* | The window transparency changes from 30 % to 80 %. |
| *waTransparent2* | The window transparency changes from 0% to 100% |
| *waTransparentFixed* | The transparency remains the same (50%) during the animation. |



- Zoom:
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *waZoom* | Zoom from the click position to the final position (straight line and constant speed). |






**`<Duration>: (Optional integer or optional Duration)`**

Duration of animation (in hundredths of a second). This parameter can correspond to: 

- an integer corresponding to the number of hundredths of a second,

- a Duration variable,

- the duration in a readable format (e.g., 1 s or 10 ms). 




**`<Sound>: (Optional character string)`**

Name of WAV file that will be played during the animation.

## Remarks




### Animation at opening
<a name="animation_opening_ELTPARAGRAPHE000149"></a>

- The animations performed during the opening are non-locking animations: the initialization codes can be run in parallel.

- The animation is performed when the window becomes visible for the first time. You can use **WinAnimationNext** in the initialization code of the global variables followed by:
	
	```wl
	MySelf.Visible = True
	```




<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>




### Miscellaneous
<a name="miscellaneous_ELTPARAGRAPHE000162"></a>

- If a new window is opened during the animation, WINDEV waits for the end of animation before opening this new window.

- The animation is not applied to the system windows (windows opened by [fSelect](../WDLang1/3036053.md), [YesNo](../WDLang1/3021005.md), ...).

- **WinAnimationNext** has priority over [WinAnimationOpening](../WDLang1/3038051.md) and [WinAnimationClosing](../WDLang1/3038050.md).
