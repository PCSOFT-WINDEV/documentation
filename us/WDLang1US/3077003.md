The following functions are used to manage threads:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [CriticalSection](../WDLang1/1000024373.md) | Enables a name or on-variable critical section in the statement [USING ... IN](../Motscles/1510025.md). |
| [CriticalSectionEnd](../WDLang1/3077005.md) | Marks the end of critical section: the code will be run by another thread. |
| [CriticalSectionStart](../WDLang1/3077001.md) | Marks the start of a critical section: no other thread will be able to run the code as long as the current thread does not exit from the critical section. |
| [EventChange](../WDLang1/3077017.md) | Modifies the status of an event. |
| [EventClose](../WDLang1/1000021272.md) | Closes a synchronization event between several threads. |
| [EventCreate](../WDLang1/3077009.md) | Creates an event. |
| [EventDestroy](../WDLang1/3077025.md) | Explicitly destroys an event. |
| [EventOpen](../WDLang1/1000021271.md) | Opens a synchronization event between several threads. |
| [EventWait](../WDLang1/3077007.md) | Locks the current thread while waiting for the specified event to be opened. |
| [ExecuteMainThread](../WDLang1/1000019862.md) | Triggers the execution of the procedure specified in the main application thread. |
| [ExecuteMainThreadAsynchronous](../WDLang1/1410088684.md) | Executes a procedure in the main thread of the application without waiting for the end of its execution. |
| [MutexCreate](../WDLang1/1000019022.md) | Explicitly creates a mutex. |
| [MutexDestroy](../WDLang1/1000019025.md) | Explicitly destroys a mutex. |
| [MutexEnd](../WDLang1/1000019024.md) | Signals that the thread frees the mutex. |
| [MutexStart](../WDLang1/1000019023.md) | Locks the current thread while waiting for the mutex to be freed. |
| [SemaphoreCreate](../WDLang1/3077012.md) | Creates a semaphore. |
| [SemaphoreDestroy](../WDLang1/3077011.md) | Explicitly destroys a semaphore. |
| [SemaphoreEnd](../WDLang1/3077010.md) | Allows one or more threads to exit from the area protected by the semaphore. |
| [SemaphoreStart](../WDLang1/3077008.md) | Locks the current thread until the semaphore is opened (which means until a "free" spot becomes available in the protected section). |
| [ThreadCurrent](../WDLang1/1000019423.md) | Returns the name of the thread currently run. |
| [ThreadEnd](../WDLang1/1000020874.md) | Ends the execution of the current thread. |
| [ThreadExecute](../WDLang1/3077024.md) | Starts the execution of a secondary thread. |
| [ThreadMode](../WDLang1/3077028.md) | Changes the management mode of threads. |
| [ThreadPause](../WDLang1/3077029.md) | Pauses the current thread during the specified duration. |
| [ThreadPersistent](../WDLang1/1000020584.md) | Makes a thread persistent. |
| [ThreadPriority](../WDLang1/3077027.md) | Returns or modifies the priority level of a thread. |
| [ThreadRequestStop](../WDLang1/1000021218.md) | Sends a stop request to a thread. |
| [ThreadResume](../WDLang1/3077023.md) | Resumes the execution of a thread that was interrupted by [ThreadSuspend](../WDLang1/3077014.md). **Function not recommended.** |
| [ThreadSendSignal](../WDLang1/3077021.md) | The current thread sends a signal to the specified thread in order to unlock it. |
| [ThreadState](../WDLang1/3077016.md) | Returns the current status of a thread. |
| [ThreadStop](../WDLang1/3077019.md) | Stops a secondary thread. **Function not recommended.** |
| [ThreadStopRequested](../WDLang1/1000021219.md) | Checks if a stop request has been sent to the running thread. |
| [ThreadSuspend](../WDLang1/3077014.md) | Temporarily suspends the execution of the specified thread. **Function not recommended.** |
| [ThreadWait](../WDLang1/3077020.md) | Waits for the end of the execution of the specified thread. |
| [ThreadWaitSignal](../WDLang1/3077022.md) | Locks the current thread until it receives a signal from another thread. |



You also have the ability to use the following types of variables: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [AutomaticEvent](../WDLang1/1000021270.md) | The **AutomaticEvent** type is used to manage an automatic event. |
| [ManualEvent](../WDLang1/1000021275.md) | The **ManualEvent** type is used to manage a manual event. |

To use this example, a first instance of the example must be started in "server" mode. Then, by specifying the name of the computer that will be used as server and a nickname, you can connect to this application in "client" mode. You now have the ability to send messages to all the connected users. In this example, a thread and a socket are associated with each connection.

Then, you have the ability to perform multi-file transfers from the local computer to the server or from the FTP server to the local computer.
