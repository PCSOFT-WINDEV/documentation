**Reminder**: Semaphores are used to define a protected code section that can only be run by a specific number of threads.

## Syntax

`SemaphoreCreate(<Semaphore name> [, <Authorization> [, <Use> [, <Options>]]])`
---

**`<Semaphore name>: (Character string)`**

Name of the semaphore to create. This name will be used by all the functions for semaphore management.

**`<Authorization>: (Optional integer)`**

Number of concurrent threads allowed in the protected section. This parameter is set to 1 by default.

**`<Use>: (Optional integer)`**

Number of threads found in the section when creating the semaphore (0 by default).

**`<Options>: (Optional Integer constant)`**

Mode for sharing the semaphore:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *shareGlobal* | The semaphore is shared among all the applications found on the computer.<br><br><br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This constant is not available. |
| *shareNone* | The semaphore is specific to the application. If [SemaphoreDestroy](../WDLang1/3077011.md) is not called, the semaphore is destroyed at the end of the application.<br><br><br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) The semaphores are unique for the application that created them. They cannot be shared between several applications. |
| *shareUser*<br>(default value) | The semaphore is shared among all the applications of the session of the user who is running the application.<br><br><br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This constant is not available. |

### Mode for sharing the semaphores
<a name="mode_for_sharing_the_semaphores_ELTPARAGRAPHE000116"></a>

In *shareUser* mode, the semaphore is shared among all the applications of the session of the user who runs the application. 

- The semaphore is created the first time an application in the user's session calls **SemaphoreCreate**.

- The following applications that call **SemaphoreCreate** connect to the existing semaphore.

- The last application that is closed destroys the semaphore.

- A semaphore with the same name cannot be used by a session of another user on the same computer: the system returns an error of access rights.




In *shareGlobal* mode, the semaphore is shared among all the applications found on the computer.

- The semaphore is created by the first application that calls **SemaphoreCreate**.

- The following applications that call **SemaphoreCreate** connect to the existing semaphore.

- The last application that is closed destroys the semaphore.
