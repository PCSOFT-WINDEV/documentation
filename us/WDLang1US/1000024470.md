Indicates that the drawing functions that will be used are intended for a variable of type [picLayer](../WDLang1/1000024604.md).

**Remark**: **&lt;picLayer variable&gt;.StartDrawing** initializes all the parameters required to create a drawing for a given element.

![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) **Caution**: A specific configuration is required to use this function in Linux. For more details, see [The drawings](../WDLang1/3029035.md).

## Example


```wl
MyImage is WDPic = "Test.bmp"
MyLayer is picLayer
// Start drawing in the layer
ResDrawing = MyLayer.StartDrawing()
// Drawings in MyLayer
...
// End of drawings in MyLayer
IMG_MyDrawing = MyImage
```

```wl
MyWDPic is WDPic = "Test.bmp"
MyLayer is picLayer

MyLayer.StartDrawing()
MyLayer.Font("Arial", 12, iNormal, 0)
MyLayer.DrawText(4, 0, "I'm writing in a picLayer variable!")
IMG_MyDrawing = MyWDPic
```

`<Result> = <picLayer image>.StartDrawing([<Options>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u>True</u></u></u> if the drawing was initialized,

- <u><u><u>False</u></u></u> otherwise.




**`<picLayer image>: (picLayer variable)`**

Name of the [picLayer](../WDLang1/1000024604.md) variable to be used.

**`<Options>: (Optional Integer constant (or combination of constants))`**

Drawing options:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *dGridlinesOpacity* | The drawing is displayed over gridlines in order to highlight the transparent or semi-transparent sections of the drawing. The gridlines are not saved in the image.<br>![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png)![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This constant is not available. |
| *dNoErase* | Does not erase the drawing in the variable. |
| *dOnChart* | Used to draw in a variable in which a chart has already been drawn. In this case, the chart drawing is not erased.<br>![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png)![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This constant is not available. |
| *dWithOpacity* | Allows managing opacity in the different drawing functions used with the variable. Used for example to create a PNG drawing with an Alpha channel. |


No drawing option is used if this parameter is not specified.

## Remarks


### Use in prefix syntax
<a name="use_prefix_syntax_ELTPARAGRAPHE000486"></a>

**&lt;picLayer variable&gt;.StartDrawing** must be called before the other drawing functions. **&lt;picLayer variable&gt;.StartDrawing** makes it possible to define the drawing options used on the [picLayer](../WDLang1/1000024604.md) variable.

### Drawing with opacity
<a name="drawing_with_opacity_ELTPARAGRAPHE000569"></a>

By creating a drawing that supports opacity, you can easily save PNG images with an Alpha channel.

**To save a PNG drawing with an Alpha channel**:

1. Use the **&lt;picLayer variable&gt;.StartDrawing** function. This function is used to define, if necessary, the element onto which the drawing functions will be applied as well as the drawing mode. The *dWithOpacity* constant is used to indicate that the drawing will manage the opacity. The *dGridlinesOpacity* constant is used to display gridlines underneath the different drawing areas.

2. Configure the opacity of your drawings with the following functions:
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [&lt;picLayer variable&gt;.Background](../WDLang1/1000024480.md) | Declares the background color and its opacity for the next drawings. |
| [&lt;picLayer variable&gt;.DrawPoint](../WDLang1/1000024500.md) | Declares the color of the points and their opacity for the next drawings. |
| [&lt;Image&gt;.Pen](../WDLang1/1000024016.md) | Declares the color of the lines and their opacity for the next drawings. |


	**Remark**: [&lt;picLayer variable&gt;.PixelOpacity](../WDLang1/1000024499.md) is used to find out the opacity of a point.

3. Use [&lt;Image&gt;.SavePNG](../WDLang1/1000024345.md) to save your drawing in PNG format with alpha channel (opacity).




**Limit**: In "Management of opacity" mode, [&lt;picLayer variable&gt;.DrawText](../WDLang1/1000024657.md) is limited to the use of True Type fonts.
