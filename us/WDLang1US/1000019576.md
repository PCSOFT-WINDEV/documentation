Copies the RGB pixels of the image into a one-dimensional or two-dimensional array. The array of colors is cleared then it is filled with the integers representing the colors (24 bits) of the image.

## Example


```wl
arrLightness is array of * by * int

dImageToArray("c:\test.png", arrLightness, dComponentRed + dGrayscale)

dStartDrawing(IMG_NoName2)
nx, ny are int
FOR nx = 1 _TO_ ArrayInfo(arrLightness, tiNumberRows)
	FOR ny = 1 _TO_ ArrayInfo(arrLightness, tiNumberColumns)
		dPoint(nx-1, ny-1, arrLightness[nx][ny])
	END
END
```

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

### Copying the pixels of an image file into an array

`dImageToArray(<Image file> , <Array> [, <Options>])`
---

**`<Image file>: (Character string)`**

Path of image file to use.

**`<Array>: (Array variable)`**

Name of the array of 24-bit color into which the pixels will be copied. This array can be a one-dimensional array or a two-dimensional array. For a two-dimensional array, the dimensions represent the X and Y axes of the image. 

**`<Options>: (Optional Integer constant (or combination of constants))`**

Options for calculating the array: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *dComponentBlue* | The Blue component of image will be copied into the array. |
| *dComponentGreen* | The Green component of image will be copied into the array. |
| *dComponentRed* | The Red component of image will be copied into the array. |
| *dComponentRGB* | All image components will be copied into the array. |
| *dGrayScale* | The image in grayscale will be copied into the array. |

### Copying the pixels of an image in memory into an array

`dImageToArray(<Image in memory> , <Array> [, <Options>])`
---

**`<Image in memory>: (Buffer or character string)`**

Byte string containing the image to use. This parameter can correspond to an image saved in memory ([dSaveImageBMP](../WDLang1/3029026.md), [dSaveImageGIF](../WDLang1/3029040.md), etc.). 

**`<Array>: (Array variable)`**

Name of the array of 24-bit color into which the pixels will be copied. This array can be a one-dimensional array or a two-dimensional array. For a two-dimensional array, the dimensions represent the X and Y axes of the image. 

**`<Options>: (Optional Integer constant (or combination of constants))`**

Options for calculating the array: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *dComponentBlue* | The Blue component of image will be copied into the array. |
| *dComponentGreen* | The Green component of image will be copied into the array. |
| *dComponentRed* | The Red component of image will be copied into the array. |
| *dComponentRGB* | All image components will be copied into the array. |
| *dGrayScale* | The image in grayscale will be copied into the array. |

## Remarks


- The alpha layer of the image is not returned by this function.

- **Change of behavior in version 23**: When converting a PDF file (i.e. a vector image) into an array of pixels, a conversion factor must be applied in order to transform a unit of the PDF into a pixel.
	From version 23 onwards, the conversion factor has been optimized, which results in a reduction in the size of the image in pixels. 
	To go back to the behavior of version 22 (non-optimized), you can use the following code (this code uses an Image variable to convert the PDF into the desired dimensions): 
	
	```wl
	lCMyImageh is string = fCurrentDir() + ["\"] + "myfile.pdf"
	iiMage is Image = dLoadImage(lCMonImageh, imgConvert, 2479, 3504)
	bufImage is Buffer = dSaveImagePNG(iiMage, inMemory)
	lSourcePixelArray is array of * by * integers
	dImageToArray(bufImage, lSourcePixelArray, dComponentRGB + dGrayScale)
	Trace(ArrayInfo(lSourcePixelArray, tiNumberRows) + TAB + ...
		ArrayInfo(lSourcePixelArray, tiNumberColumns))
	```
