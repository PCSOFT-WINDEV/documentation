Starts the execution of a program (an executable for example) from the current application. 

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png)![User code (UMC)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/MCU.png) This allows you to retrieve:

- the return value of executable with the *exeReturnValue* constant.

- the process identifier, also called PID with the *exePID* constant.




![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) **Remarks**:

- From Windows Vista, the applications may fail to start if the UAC mechanism is enabled. For more details, see [remarks](#NOTE0_5).

- In 64-bit Windows, the access to a system directory from a 32-bit executable can be performed in a directory that differs from the expected one. For more details, see [Native 64-bit and native 32-bit](../Editeurs/2030048.md).

## Example

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) 
```wl
// Start Notepad in default mode
ExeRun("NOTEPAD.EXE Readme.txt")
```


<a name="Example2"></a>
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) 
```wl
// Start a program with long name containing space characters
// For example: Word with "My documents" as working directory

// Solution 1: Using the syntax specific to the multiline strings
// (to avoid doubling or tripling the quotes)
IF ExeRun([
	"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office12\WINWORD.EXE"
	], ...
	exeActive, exeDontWait, SysDir(srMyDocuments)) = False THEN
		Error(ErrorInfo())
END

// Solution 2: Doubling the quotes
ExeRun("""C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office12\WINWORD.EXE""", ...
	exeActive, exeDontWait, SysDir(srMyDocuments))
```
<a name="Example3"></a>
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) 
```wl
// Start applications with a file in command line
// Name of application to start
sAppName is string = "C:\Program Files\Adobe\Photoshop 6.0\Photoshp.exe"
// Name of the image to open
sImageName is string = "C:\Users\My Name\Pictures\Buildings\IMGP0993.JPG"

// Equivalent to "Start Run" 
// We must get a character string containing "" such as: 
// "C:\Program Files\Adobe\Photoshop 6.0\Photoshp.exe" 
// "C:\Users\My Name\Pictures\Buildings\IMGP0993.JPG"
IF ExeRun(StringBuild([
"%1" "%2"
], sAppName, sImageName)) = False THEN
	Error(ErrorInfo())
END

## Syntax

### Running an executable (in locking or non-locking mode)

`<Result> = ExeRun(<Program name> [, <Mode> [, <Wait for end> [, <Working directory>]]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**

**`<Program name>: (Character string)`**

Name of program to start with its path and/or the parameters that must be passed to the program (if necessary). 

- **If no path is specified**, the program is sought in the current directory, then in the Windows directory and in the directories accessible by PATH. 

- **If the executable corresponds to a long name with space characters**, the following syntax must be used:
	
	```txt
	<Program name> = " " " Long_name_with_spaces" " Command_line"
	```







**`<Mode>: (Optional integer constant)`**

Program start mode (no action on DOS programs): 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *exeActive*<br>(Default value) | The program run is active, it "takes control" over the current program. |
| *exeIconize* | The program run is inactive and it is minimized.<br><br><br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This constant is not available. |
| *exeInactive* | The program run is inactive: it is run while the current program keeps focus. <br><br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This constant is not available. |
| *exeMaximize* | The program run is active, it "takes control" over the current program (the execution window is maximized).<br><br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This constant is not available. |
| *exeNoHandleInheritance* | Indicates that the executable should not inherit handles from the parent (applies to ALL handles, including files).

![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) The program run is always active: it is run by "taking control" over the current program. 

**`<Wait for end>: (Optional Boolean constant)`**

Configures the timeout before resuming the execution of the current program: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *exeDontWait*<br>(Default value) | The current program and the launched program run in parallel. |
| *exeWait* | The current program resumes its execution when the program run is over.<br><br> |

### Starting a program and retrieving a value

`<Result> = ExeRun(<Program name> [, <Mode> [, <Element to return> [, <Working directory>]]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**

Sought value:

- Return value of the executable if &lt;Element to return&gt; corresponds to the *exeReturnValue* constant.

- PID of the executable if &lt;Element to return&gt; corresponds to the *exePID* constant.




[ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) is used to find out whether an error occurred.

**`<Program name>: (Character string)`**

Name of program to start with its path and/or the parameters that must be passed to the program (if necessary). 

- **If no path is specified**, the program is sought in the current directory, then in the Windows directory and in the directories accessible by PATH. 

- **If the executable corresponds to a long name with space characters**, the following syntax must be used:
	&lt;Program name&gt; = " " " Long_name_with_spaces" " Command_line"




**`<Mode>: (Optional integer constant)`**

Program start mode (no action on DOS programs).


|   |   |

| *exeIconize* | The program run is inactive and it is minimized |
| *exeInactive* | The program run is inactive: it is run while the current program keeps focus |
| *exeMaximize* | The program run is active, it "takes control" over the current program (the execution window is maximized) |

![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This parameter is ignored. The program run is active, it "takes control" over the current program. 

**`<Element to return>: (Optional constant)`**

Configures the function result:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *exePID* | The current program and the launched program run in parallel. &lt;Result&gt; corresponds to the identifier of created process (also called PID) if the executable was successfully run, 0 if an error occurred. <br>This identifier can be used in some APIs for example.<br><br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This constant is not available. |
| *exeReturnValue* | The current program resumes its execution when the program run is over. &lt;Result&gt; is the return value of the executable. |



**`<Working directory>: (Optional character string)`**

Working directory of the application to be started.

## Remarks


### Using a command line
<a name="using_command_line_ELTPARAGRAPHE000265"></a>

To pass parameters in command line to the executable run, you must specify the name and full path of the executable to run.

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) If the program run was developed with WINDEV or WINDEV Mobile, you can get the command line using [CommandLine](../WDLang1/3013051.md).
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png)![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png)![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png)![User code (UMC)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/MCU.png) 

### Using the exeActive constant
<a name="using_the_exeactive_constant_ELTPARAGRAPHE000281"></a>

If the process where the application is run (with the *exeActive* constant) runs a code allowing the calling program to regain focus, the called program loses control.

In order for the called program to keep focus, you must avoid:

- call another window or dialog box after the call to **ExeRun**, 

- calling [SetFocusAndReturnToUserInput](../WDLang1/1410088107.md) after **ExeRun**.




In addition, the Button control (if there is one) whose associated "Click" event contains a call to **ExeRun** must not be "Tab Stop" ("Accessible by TAB" in the "UI" tab of the control description).

### Return value of a WINDEV executable
<a name="return_value_windev_executable_ELTPARAGRAPHE000310"></a>

A WINDEV executable can return a value. Simply:

1. Create an Integer variable global to the project.

2. Initialize this variable with the value to return.

3. Return this variable with the [RETURN](../Motscles/1510007.md) keyword in the project closing code.

### Starting an application in Windows Vista (and later)
<a name="starting_application_windows_vista_and_later_ELTPARAGRAPHE000341"></a>

If UAC (User Account Control) is enabled, the application that uses **ExeRun** to start another application must have higher permissions than the application that is started.

For example, a first application started with the administrator rights can start a second application that requires no specific rights. 

If the second application requires greater rights than the application that starts it, the second application may fail to start. Windows proposes to enable the management of compatibility with Windows Vista. If the management of compatibility is enabled, the second application will be run during its next startup. You can also use [ShellExecute](../WDLang1/3035007.md).

### Miscellaneous
<a name="miscellaneous_ELTPARAGRAPHE000359"></a>

- **ExeRun** does not modify the current directory. The current directory before running **ExeRun** is identical to the current directory after running **ExeRun**. 

- If the program run ignores the specified runtime mode, the program is run in *exeActive* mode.
