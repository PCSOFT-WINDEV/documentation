## Remarks


- The working hours are highlighted by a different color. This color is chosen in the style options of the control. 

- **SchedulerWorkingHourResource** replaces the working hours defined with the [WorkingHourStart](../Proprietes/1000018958.md) and [WorkingHourEnd](../Proprietes/1000019056.md) properties and the [SchedulerWorkingHour](../WDLang1/1000022404.md) function.

- [GanttWorkingHour](../WDLang1/1000021117.md) is the equivalent function for Gantt Chart controls.
