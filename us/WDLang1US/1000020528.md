Displays a custom information message inside a system info box for a specified amount of time. After the timeout, the system window is automatically closed.

Remarks: 

- **This information window blocks the application until the time limit has elapsed**. To continue running the application, the user must click "OK". 
	![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) To avoid blocking the application, use [InfoWithTimeoutAsynchronous](../WDLang1/1000025271.md).

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) WINDEV allows you to apply the skin template of your project to this dialog box. For more details, see [Customizing dialog boxes](../WDLang1/3021003.md).

## Remarks




### Features of the dialog box
<a name="features_the_dialog_box_ELTPARAGRAPHE000074"></a>

- The title of the dialog box is the title of the current window. To modify this title, use [NextTitle](../WDLang1/3038043.md).

- The message is aligned to the left.

- The button caption depends on the runtime language of Windows.

- The maximum number of characters cannot exceed 4096. If a larger string is passed as parameter, it will be truncated.

- The icon displayed (information tooltip) cannot be modified.

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) **To customize this dialog box** (and all the system dialog boxes in your application), check "Customize system windows (Info, YesNo, Confirm, Dialog)" in the "Style" tab of the project description. For more details, see [Customizing dialog boxes](../WDLang1/3021003.md).

### Line break in the dialog box
<a name="line_break_the_dialog_box_ELTPARAGRAPHE000099"></a>

The CR string (Carriage Return) can be used to force a break to the next line. For example: 

```wl
InfoWithTimeout(500, "The form XXX was modified." + CR + "This form will be saved.")
```

is equivalent to: 

```wl
InfoWithTimeout(500, "The form XXX was modified.", "This form will be saved.")
```


You also have the ability to use the syntax of multiline strings. For example: 

```wl
InfoWithTimeout(500,
[
The XXX form has been modified.

This form will be saved.
])
```

### Special cases
<a name="special_cases_ELTPARAGRAPHE000117"></a>

- Timers ([TimerSys](../WDLang1/3015006.md)) are not stopped when this function is called.

- Windows events are not stopped when this function is called.

- The text of the buttons is displayed in the system language.

- Equivalence: **InfoWithTimeout** is equivalent to [Info](../WDLang1/3021011.md) used with [DelayBeforeClosing](../WDLang1/3038040.md): 
	The following code: 
	
	```wl
	InfoWithTimeout(1000, "Form modified")
	```

	is equivalent to: 
	
	```wl
	DelayBeforeClosing(1000)
	Info("Form modified")
	```
