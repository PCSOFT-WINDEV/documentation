## Remarks


- If the cell (Column, Row) does not exist, the cell is created.

- If the cell (Column, Row) already exists, the content is deleted. It is replaced with the &lt;Formula&gt; formula. 

- This function can only be used on a Spreadsheet control found in a window. 

- The cells can be renamed ([SpreadsheetAddName](../WDLang1/1000022523.md)). You have the ability to use the name of a cell in the formula.
