<a name="tips_for_using_the_internal_cache_directory_the_application_ELTPARAGRAPHE000043"></a>

- We advise you to limit the volume of data stored in cache and to delete this data as soon as it is no longer used.

- The data stored in the cache directory of application on the internal storage space cannot be accessed by the other applications.
