**`<Suggestions>: (Character string)`**



- List of words or sentences proposed by the speech recognition service based on the words pronounced by the user. Each proposition is separated by a CR character (Carriage Return). 

- Empty string ("") in the following cases: 

	- if the speech recognition was canceled by the user. 

	- if an error occurred. 

	- if no match was found by the speech recognition service. 


 In this case, the [ErrorOccurred](../WDLang1/3087001.md) variable is set to <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md).
