## Remarks




### Limitation of RTF format
<a name="limitation_rtf_format_ELTPARAGRAPHE000048"></a>

The format of RTF files supported by WINDEV is the same as the RTF format supported by "Wordpad" (up to Windows XP). Some additional limits must be noticed when exporting a report to an RTF document (the tables are not supported for instance).

If the RTF file is generated by another tool (Word, etc.), it is recommended to open the file with Wordpad to check the RTF compatibility. The display of the file in Wordpad will provide a better preview of what will be printed.

In all cases, we recommend that you re-save the file in Wordpad to force the RTF format.
 
In WINDEV, **RTFLoad** forces the use of RTF. Simply use **RTFLoad** to assign the file to the RTF control
