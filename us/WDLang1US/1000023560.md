The **Chrono** type is used to define all the advanced characteristics of a stopwatch. The characteristics of this stopwatch can be defined and changed using different WLanguage properties. 

**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

### Properties specific to Chrono variables
<a name="properties_specific_chrono_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000043"></a>

The following properties can be used to handle a **Chrono** variable:

| Property name | Type used | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Started | Boolean | <br><br>- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the stopwatch is started,<br><br>- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. <br><br><br><br><br>**This property is read-only**. |
| Value | Duration | Timed elapsed. <br><br>Remark: This property corresponds to the result of [ChronoValue](../WDLang1/3027033.md). <br><br>**This property is read-only**. |

### WLanguage functions that use the Chrono type
<a name="wlanguage_functions_that_use_the_chrono_type_ELTPARAGRAPHE000085"></a>

- The following functions use the **Chrono** type: 
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [ChronoEnd](../WDLang1/3027032.md) | Stops a stopwatch and returns the time elapsed (in milliseconds) since the start of timing (call to [ChronoStart](../WDLang1/3027031.md)). |
| [ChronoPause](../WDLang1/1000018829.md) | Pauses a stopwatch in order to measure the time spent on a process. |
| [ChronoReset](../WDLang1/1000020474.md) | Stops and resets a running stopwatch. |
| [ChronoResume](../WDLang1/1000018830.md) | Restarts a stopwatch that was stopped by [ChronoEnd](../WDLang1/3027032.md) or [ChronoPause](../WDLang1/1000018829.md). |
| [ChronoStart](../WDLang1/3027031.md) | Starts a stopwatch to measure the duration of a process (in milliseconds) and resets a running stopwatch. |
| [ChronoValue](../WDLang1/3027033.md) | Indicates the time elapsed (in milliseconds) since the call to [ChronoStart](../WDLang1/3027031.md). |

- The following functions use the **Chrono** type (prefix syntax): 
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [&lt;Chrono&gt;.End](../WDLang1/1000023789.md) | Stops a stopwatch and returns the time elapsed (in milliseconds) since the start of timing (call to [&lt;Chrono&gt;.Start](../WDLang1/1000023788.md)). |
| [&lt;Chrono&gt;.Pause](../WDLang1/1000023790.md) | Pauses a stopwatch in order to measure the time spent on a process. |
| [&lt;Chrono&gt;.Reset](../WDLang1/1000023791.md) | Stops and resets a running stopwatch. |
| [&lt;Chrono&gt;.Resume](../WDLang1/1000023792.md) | Resumes a stopwatch previously stopped by [&lt;Chrono&gt;.Fin](../WDLang1/1000023789.md) or [&lt;Chrono&gt;.Pause](../WDLang1/1000023790.md). |
| [&lt;Chrono&gt;.Start](../WDLang1/1000023788.md) | Starts a stopwatch to measure the duration of a process (in milliseconds) and resets a running stopwatch. |
