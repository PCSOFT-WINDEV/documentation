## Syntax

`<Result> = fDetectRemovableStorage(<WLanguage procedure>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the detection was performed. 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. 




**`<WLanguage procedure>: (Procedure name)`**



- Name of WLanguage procedure that will be run during the detection. This procedure is called whenever a storage unit is inserted or ejected.

- Empty string ("") to disable the detection. 




This procedure has the following format:

```txt
PROCEDURE <Procedure name>(<Drive letter>, <Type of action>)
```


&lt;Drive letter&gt; is a string used to find out the letter of the drive associated with the storage unit.

&lt;Type of action&gt; is an integer used to find out whether the device was inserted or ejected. This parameter can take one of the following values:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *RemovableStorageInserted* | A removable storage unit was inserted. |
| *RemovableStorageRemoved* | A removable storage unit was ejected. |

## Remarks


### Multiple calls to fDetectRemovableStorage
<a name="multiple_calls_fdetectremovablestorage_ELTPARAGRAPHE000058"></a>

If this function is run several times with different procedures passed as parameter, the last procedure used will replace all the procedures previously called: the first procedures will no longer be called.
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Procedure local to the window
<a name="procedure_local_the_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000065"></a>

If the &lt;WLanguage procedure&gt; is local to a window, the detection will stop when the window is closed. We recommend that you use a global procedure.

### Limitations
<a name="limitations_ELTPARAGRAPHE000072"></a>

**fDetectRemovableStorage** must not be run from a secondary thread.
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Equivalence
<a name="equivalence_ELTPARAGRAPHE000081"></a>

**fDetectRemovableStorage** and [USBDetectRemovableStorage](../WDLang1/3090007.md) are equivalent.
