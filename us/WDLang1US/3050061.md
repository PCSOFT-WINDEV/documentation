## Example


```wl
// Amortization matrix for an "In Fine" loan of $25000
// with a fixed interest rate of 5% over 6 years
ResAmortization = FinRedemption("AmortMatrix", finInFine, 25000, 5, 6)
```

## Syntax

`<Result> = FinRedemption(<Matrix name> , <Type of amortization> [, <Capital> [, <Rate> [, <Duration>]]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the amortization matrix was created, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) with the *errMessage* constant.




**`<Matrix name>: ()`**

Name of amortization matrix. This matrix is automatically created when calculating the amortization. This matrix contains 5 columns. Each column corresponds to a specific information:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| Column 1 | Year |
| Column 2 | Balance to repay |
| Column 3 | Advantage |
| Column 4 | Amortization |
| Column 5 | Yearly payment |



**`<Type of amortization>: (Constant)`**

Indicates the type of amortization:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *finConstantAnnualPayment* | ***Constant yearly payment:*** Each year, the borrower pays the same amount to the lender, including principal and interests. |
| *finConstantRedemption* | ***Constant amortization: ***Each year, the value of the amortization is fixed; the other parameters are calculated accordingly. |
| *finInFine* | ***"In Fine" repayment:*** During the entire loan duration, the borrower only pays the interests, the principal being paid the last year of the loan. |



**`<Capital>: (Optional real or currency)`**

Total capital borrowed (0 by default).

**`<Rate>: (Optional real)`**

Interest rate of the loan, expressed in percentage (1 by default). For example, for a 5% rate, this parameter will be set to 5.

**`<Duration>: (Optional real)`**

Duration of the loan, expressed in years (1 by default).

## Remarks
The existence of the amortization matrix is not checked. This matrix is overwritten if it existed beforehand. To check the matrix existence, use [MatExist](../WDLang1/3050076.md).

Then, the content of amortization matrix can be read by the following functions:

- [MatRead](../WDLang1/3050074.md): Reads the value of a matrix element.

- [MatReadColumn](../WDLang1/3050070.md): Reads the value of all the elements found in a matrix column.

- [MatReadLine](../WDLang1/3050032.md): Reads the value of all elements found in a matrix row.
