## Syntax

`<Result> = DateDifference(<Start date> , <End date>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**

Number of days elapsed between two dates. This number of days is the result of the following operation: 

```txt
<End date> - <Start date>
```

The number of days is negative if &lt;Start date&gt; is after &lt;End date&gt;.

**`<Start date>: (Character string or Date variable)`**

Start date for the calculation in YYYYMMDD format (YYYY corresponds to the year, MM to the month and DD to the day).

**`<End date>: (Character string or Date variable)`**

End date for the calculation in YYYYMMDD format (YYYY corresponds to the year, MM to the month and DD to the day).

## Remarks
The validity of the dates passed as parameters is checked. A message is displayed if the date is invalid. You can check the validity of a date using [DateValid](../WDLang1/3027003.md).

This function cannot be used to calculate the difference between two dates before October 14, 1582 (the change from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar will not be taken into account).

The date storage format allows you to store dates from 01/01/0001 to 12/31/9999.

[WLanguage functions](../WDLang1/3027029.md) and [WLanguage properties](../Proprietes/2514010.md) make accurate calculations on dates from January 1st, 1583.
