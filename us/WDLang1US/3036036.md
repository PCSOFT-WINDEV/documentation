Opens an external file (ANSI or UNICODE) in order to handle it through programming. You can also use [fLoadText](../WDLang1/3036006.md).

Remarks: 

- To handle text external files, we recommend that you use [fSaveBuffer](../WDLang1/1000019412.md)/[fLoadText](../WDLang1/3036006.md) and [fSaveText](../WDLang1/3036046.md)/[fLoadBuffer](../WDLang1/1000019410.md). 

- To handle binary external files, use [fCreate](../WDLang1/3036017.md) or **fOpen**. 

- To open and display an external file in the associated software (to display a.DOC file in Word for example), use [ShellExecute](../WDLang1/3035007.md).

## Syntax

`<Result> = fOpen(<File path> [, <Opening mode>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer or DiskFile variable)`**

Corresponds to:

- an integer:  

	- the identifier of the external file. This identifier will be used by all the functions for handling the external files.

	- -1 if an error occurred. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) with the *errMessage* constant.




- a variable of type [DiskFile](../WDLang1/1410088883.md). If an error occurs, the [ErrorOccurred](../WDLang1/3087001.md) variable is set to <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) with the *errMessage* constant.
	




**`<File path>: (Character string)`**

Name and full (or relative) path of file (up to 260 characters). A UNC path can be used.


**`<Opening mode>: (Optional constant (or combination of constants))`**

Constants used to define the opening mode of the file, the access mode to the file and the lock mode of the file.

- Opening mode of file: 
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *foAdd* | Open the file in "addition" mode. At opening, the current position corresponds to the last byte of the file. |
| *foCreate* | Create the file. If the file already exists (same name, same directory), this file is deleted and recreated. |
| *foCreateIfNotExist* | Create the file only if this file does not exist. The current position corresponds to the first byte of the file. |



- Access mode to the file. This type is used by [fReadLine](../WDLang1/3036031.md) and [fWriteLine](../WDLang1/3036025.md) to define the type of information to read and write in the external file:
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *foAnsi* | Ansi file. This constant is used to manage an Ansi file when the "Use Unicode strings at runtime" mode is enabled in the project configuration.<br><br>Mode used by default:<br><br>	- in the WINDEV and WEBDEV projects earlier than version 17.<br><br>	- in the configurations of WINDEV and WEBDEV projects that use the "Use Ansi strings at runtime" mode from version 17.<br><br><br> |
| *foUnicode* | Unicode file. This constant is used to manage a Unicode file when the "Use ANSI strings at runtime" mode is enabled in the project configuration.<br><br>Mode used by default:<br><br>	- in the WINDEV Mobile projects regardless of the mode and version used.<br><br>	- in the configurations of WINDEV and WEBDEV projects that use the "Use Unicode strings at runtime" mode from version 17.<br><br><br> |



- File locking mode: 
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *foAutomaticDeletion* | The file is locked when opened, and will be automatically deleted when closed (when [fClose](../WDLang1/3036027.md) is called, or when the application is closed).<br>If multiple applications are using the file, it will be automatically deleted when the last application closes it (when [fClose](../WDLang1/3036027.md) is called, or at the end of the application).<br>![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) This constant is not available.<br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) The file will not be deleted if it is being used by another application when it is closed (when [fClose](../WDLang1/3036027.md) is called, or when the application is closed). |
| *foRead* | Open the file in "read-only" mode. This file can only be read. |
| *foReadLock* | The other applications cannot read the current file.<br>![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png)![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This constant is not available. |

## Remarks


### Handling errors
<a name="handling_errors_ELTPARAGRAPHE000293"></a>

**fOpen** throws an error in the following cases:

- the file does not exist, 

- the file is locked by another computer or by another application, 

- the user has no read or write rights on the file to open.

- a Unicode string was used for &lt;File path&gt; in an operating system such as Windows 98 or Windows Me.


**Remark**: The opening in modification of a file found in a write-protected diskette is successful.

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![User code (UMC)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/MCU.png) 

### Operating mode in Windows Vista (and later)
<a name="operating_mode_windows_vista_and_later_ELTPARAGRAPHE000534"></a>

If this function does not operate properly in Windows Vista (and later), check whether the file or directory used is not in one of the system directories (Windows directory or "Program Files" directory).

**In Windows Vista (and later), with the [UAC mechanism](../Editeurs/2025014.md) (User Account Control) enabled**, you must have administrator privileges to handle and/or modify the files or directories in system directories (Windows directory or "Program Files" directory).

**Programming tip**: To handle and/or modify the files or directories without administrator privileges, you should:

- avoid writing to the Windows directory or to the "Program Files" directory, 

- use the system directory of the application (returned by [SysDir](../WDLang1/3073026.md) with the *srAppDataCommun* constant, for example).



<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Opening mode of file
<a name="opening_mode_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000318"></a>

By default, if the access mode to the file is not specified, the file is opened according to the file attribute (defined in Windows).

An error occurs if the specified access mode does not correspond to the file attribute.

A file in "read/write" mode can be opened in all the access modes supported by **fOpen** (*foWrite*, *foRead* and *foReadWrite* constants).

A file in "read-only" mode can only be opened in "read-only" mode (*foRead* constant).
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Multiple openings of the same file
<a name="multiple_openings_the_same_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000333"></a>

The same file can be opened several times simultaneously. Each opening is associated with a different file identifier. Each version of the file must be handled individually via its own identifier.
<a name="NOTE0_5"></a>


### Position in the file
<a name="position_the_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000340"></a>

When opening a file, the current position corresponds to:

- the first file byte,

- the last byte of the file is the file is opened in "addition" mode (*foAdd* constant).




This position can be modified by [fSeek](../WDLang1/3036039.md).
<a name="NOTE0_6"></a>


### Concatenating several external files
<a name="concatenating_several_external_files_ELTPARAGRAPHE000355"></a>

To concatenate several external files, you must:

- open the destination file in "addition" mode (*foAdd* constant), 

- open the source file in "read-only" mode (*foRead* or *foReadWrite* constant), 

- read the source file line by line with [fReadLine](../WDLang1/3036031.md), 

- write into the destination file line by line with [fWriteLine](../WDLang1/3036025.md).



<a name="NOTE0_7"></a>


### Compatibility between the different versions of WINDEV/WEBDEV
<a name="compatibility_between_the_different_versions_windevwebdev_ELTPARAGRAPHE000373"></a>

The *foText* constant (opening in text mode) and the *foBinary* constant (opening in binary mode) are not required anymore. They are replaced with the value 0. In this case, **fOpen** tries to open the file in read/write mode.

### Locking and unlocking
<a name="locking_and_unlocking_ELTPARAGRAPHE000384"></a>

If a file is locked when opened (*foReadLock* or *foWriteLock*), it will be automatically unlocked when closed (with [fClose](../WDLang1/3036027.md)).
<a name="NOTE0_9"></a>
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png)![User code (UMC)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/MCU.png) 

### Managing text files in UNICODE
<a name="managing_text_files_unicode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000396"></a>

**fOpen** is used to read and write text files in "UTF-16 Little Endian" UNICODE characters.

The syntax:

- **fOpen(&lt;File name&gt;, foRead + foUnicode)**: is used to open a Unicode file. If the "Current Unicode" mark (FFFE) is found at the beginning of the file, it is automatically read. 

- ** fOpen(&lt;File name&gt;, foCreation + foUnicode)**: is used to create a Unicode file. The "Current Unicode" mark (FFFE) is automatically added at the beginning of the file. 

- ** fOpen (&lt;File name&gt;, foCreationIfNotFound + foUnicode)**: is used to create a UNICODE file if this file does not exist. The "Current Unicode" mark (FFFE) is automatically added at the beginning of the file this one is actually created. If the file exists and if it starts with the "Current Unicode" mark (FFFE), this mark is automatically read.
