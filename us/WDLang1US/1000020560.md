## Example


```wl
// Open the certificate picker of Windows
MyCertificate is Certificate
MyCertificate = CertificateSelect()

// Cancelation or error
IF MyCertificate = Null THEN
	RETURN
END

// If the selected certificate is valid for signing
IF NOT MyCertificate.ValidForSignature THEN
	Info("The selected certificate cannot be used to generate a signature.")
	RETURN
END

// Retrieve the buffer containing the signature
IF NOT CertificateSignExecutable(sFullFileName, MyCertificate) THEN
	Error("Error while signing the certificate:" + CR + ErrorInfo())
END

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = CertificateSignExecutable(<Executable> , <Certificate> [, <Description> [, <Algorithm>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the executable was signed, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) with the *errMessage* constant.




**`<Executable>: (Character string)`**

Full name of executable file to sign. 

**`<Certificate>: (Certificate variable)`**

Name of the variable of type [Certificate](../WDLang1/1000019287.md) that contains the certificate to be used to sign the executable. 

**`<Description>: (Optional character string)`**

Text displayed by the UAC window when running the executable. 

**`<Algorithm>: (Integer constant)`**

Hash algorithm used by the signature: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *certSHA160* <br>(Default value) | Algorithm also known as SHA1. |
| *certSHA256* | Algorithm also known as SHA2. <br><br>Remark: This algorithm is not supported in Windows Vista. The UAC does not display any information and the executable can be run.   |
