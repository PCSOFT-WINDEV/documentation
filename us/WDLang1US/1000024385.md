## Example


```wl
// Create an event
Event_Letsgo is AutomaticEvent(eventClose)
// Run a first thread
ThreadExecute("Thread1", threadNormal, "Thread_First")
// Locks the current thread until the event is obtained
ThreadWaitSignal()

// Run a second thread
ThreadExecute("Thread2", threadNormal, "Thread_Second")
// Locks the current thread until the event is obtained
ThreadWaitSignal()

// Opens the event to run the threads
Event_Letsgo.Open()
```

```wl
PROCEDURE Thread_First()
Trace(dbgInfo(dbgProcess) + " - ThreadSendSignal(threadMain)")
ThreadSendSignal(threadMain)
Event_Letsgo.Wait()
Trace(dbgInfo(dbgProcess) + " - Event received")
```

```wl
PROCEDURE Thread_Second()
Trace(dbgInfo(dbgProcess) + " - ThreadSendSignal(threadMain)")
ThreadSendSignal(threadMain)
Event_Letsgo.Wait()
Trace(dbgInfo(dbgProcess) + " - Event received")
```

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Event>.Open()`
---

**`<Event>: (AutomaticEvent variable)`**

Name of a variable of type [AutomaticEvent](../WDLang1/1000021270.md) to be opened.







<a name="NOTE0"></a>
<a name="NOTE0_1"></a>

## Remarks


- This function is equivalent to the following syntax of [EventChange](../WDLang1/3077017.md): 
	
	```txt
	EventChange(<Event>, eventOpen)
	```


- **For an automatic event**: A single thread is processed by the event. 
	The event is automatically closed once the thread is processed. 

	- **Pending threads**: If there is no pending thread, the event remains open until the next thread, then it is closed. 

	- **New threads**: The new threads are added to the pending queue.
