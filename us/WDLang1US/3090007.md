END
```

```wl

## Syntax

`<Result> = USBDetectRemovableStorage(<WLanguage procedure>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the detection was performed. 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. 




**`<WLanguage procedure>: (Procedure name)`**



- Name of WLanguage procedure that will be run during the detection, 

- Empty string ("") to disable the detection. 




This procedure is called whenever a storage unit is inserted or ejected.

This procedure has the following format:

```txt
PROCEDURE <WLanguage procedure>(<Drive letter>, <Type of action>)
```


&lt;Drive letter&gt; is a string used to find out the letter of the drive associated with the storage unit. 
Remark: If the storage unit triggers the appearance of several drive letters, these ones will be separated by tabulations (&lt;Drive Letter 1&gt; + TAB + &lt;Drive Letter 2&gt; + ... + TAB + &lt;Drive Letter N>).

The &lt;Type of action&gt; parameter is an integer constant used to find out whether the device was inserted or ejected. This parameter can take one of the following values:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *RemovableStorageInserted* | A removable storage unit was inserted. |
| *RemovableStorageRemoved* | A removable storage unit was ejected. |

## Remarks




### Multiple calls to USBDetectRemovableStorage
<a name="multiple_calls_usbdetectremovablestorage_ELTPARAGRAPHE000064"></a>

If this function is run several times with different procedures passed as parameter, the last procedure used will replace all the procedures previously called: the first procedures will no longer be called.
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Procedure local to the window
<a name="procedure_local_the_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000071"></a>

If the WLanguage procedure is local to a window, the detection will stop when the window is closed. We recommend that you use a global procedure.

### Limitations
<a name="limitations_ELTPARAGRAPHE000079"></a>

**USBDetectRemovableStorage** must not be run from a secondary thread.
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>




### Equivalence
<a name="equivalence_ELTPARAGRAPHE000089"></a>

**USBDetectRemovableStorage** and [fDetectRemovableStorage](../WDLang1/3036061.md) are equivalent.
