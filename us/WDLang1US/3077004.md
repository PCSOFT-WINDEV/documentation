## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000378"></a>
At runtime, an application runs in a **main thread**.

This application can start a **secondary thread** at any time: this thread is run in parallel with the application. It corresponds to a local or global procedure of the application.

The secondary thread is run in parallel with the main application. All processes that can be run in the background can be performed in this thread: receiving emails, etc.

**Remark**: an efficient thread is a thread that waits for a specific event such as a user action, an incoming phone call or email, ...

## Simple management of threads
<a name="simple_management_threads_ELTTEXTE000408"></a>


### Principle
<a name="principle_ELTPARAGRAPHE000042"></a>

**A secondary thread is created by [ThreadExecute](../WDLang1/3077024.md).**

A secondary thread is automatically stopped when:

- the procedure corresponding to the thread is ended, 

- the object that created the thread is closed.




To force the stop: 

- of a secondary thread:

	1. use the [ThreadRequestStop](../WDLang1/1000021218.md) function, 

	2. check the result of [ThreadStopRequested](../WDLang1/1000021219.md) in the secondary thread in order to end the execution of the thread by exiting the procedure, or by calling [ThreadEnd](../WDLang1/1000020874.md).







- of the current thread, use [ThreadEnd](../WDLang1/1000020874.md).




**Caution**: If a WLanguage function is currently run when a thread is stopped, the thread will actually stop after the execution of the function.

### WLanguage functions
<a name="wlanguage_functions_ELTPARAGRAPHE000082"></a>The following functions are used to manage threads:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [ThreadCurrent](../WDLang1/1000019423.md) | Returns the name of the thread currently run. |
| [ThreadEnd](../WDLang1/1000020874.md) | Ends the execution of the current thread. |
| [ThreadExecute](../WDLang1/3077024.md) | Starts the execution of a secondary thread. |
| [ThreadMode](../WDLang1/3077028.md) | Changes the management mode of threads. |
| [ThreadPause](../WDLang1/3077029.md) | Pauses the current thread during the specified duration. |
| [ThreadPriority](../WDLang1/3077027.md) | Returns or modifies the priority level of a thread. |
| [ThreadRequestStop](../WDLang1/1000021218.md) | Sends a stop request to a thread. |
| [ThreadResume](../WDLang1/3077023.md) | Resumes the execution of a thread that was interrupted by [ThreadSuspend](../WDLang1/3077014.md). **Function not recommended.** |
| [ThreadState](../WDLang1/3077016.md) | Returns the current status of a thread. |
| [ThreadStop](../WDLang1/3077019.md) | Stops a secondary thread. **Function not recommended.** |
| [ThreadStopRequested](../WDLang1/1000021219.md) | Checks if a stop request has been sent to the running thread. |
| [ThreadSuspend](../WDLang1/3077014.md) | Temporarily suspends the execution of the specified thread. **Function not recommended.** |
| [ThreadWait](../WDLang1/3077020.md) | Waits for the end of the execution of the specified thread. |

## Characteristics of a thread
<a name="characteristics_thread_ELTTEXTE000534"></a>


### Characteristics of threads
<a name="characteristics_threads_ELTPARAGRAPHE000097"></a>

In WLanguage, a secondary thread can be associated with:

- a procedure local to the current window, 

- a procedure global to the project, 

- a method of a class, 

- a global method of a class.




A secondary thread can be a **secure thread**. In this mode: 

- a compilation error will occur if the controls are accessed in the thread (or if the procedure uses the "UI" attribute). 

- an exception will be thrown: 

	- if the thread accesses the controls at runtime,

	- if the [ThreadStop](../WDLang1/3077019.md) function is called.




- when the window that triggered the thread is closed, a request to stop the thread is generated (but the thread continues to run after the window is closed). 







### Extension attributes related to threads
<a name="extension_attributes_related_threads_ELTPARAGRAPHE000124"></a>

When declaring a procedure or a class method, you can use extension attributes to specify the characteristics of the thread: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *&lt;thread&gt;* | Used to specify that the procedure will be run in a secondary thread. <br>This extension attribute is not compatible with **&lt;timer&gt;** and **&lt;main thread>**. |
| *&lt;main thread&gt;* | Used to specify that the procedure will be executed in the main thread. <br>This extension attribute is not compatible with **&lt;timer&gt;** and **&lt;thread>**. |
| *&lt;main thread asynchronous&gt;* | Indicates that the procedure will be executed in the main thread and that there is no need to wait for the end of the execution of this procedure. <br>This extension attribute is not compatible with **&lt;timer&gt;** and **&lt;thread>**. |
| *&lt;secure thread&gt;* | Used to specify that the procedure will be run in a secure secondary thread. <br>This extension attribute is not compatible with **&lt;timer&gt;**, **&lt;main thread&gt;** and . |
| *&lt;light HFSQL context&gt;* | Triggers the immediate copy of a part of the current HFSQL context. <br>Only the directories containing the data files in HFSQL Classic mode and/or the connections in HFSQL Client/Server mode are stored.<br><br>This extension attribute must be used with **&lt;thread&gt;**. <br><br>![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) This extension attribute is not available. |
| *&lt;full HFSQL context&gt;* | Triggers the immediate copy of the current HFSQL context.<br>Recommended if the thread must take into account the current positions in the files and queries of caller context.<br><br>This extension attribute must be used with **&lt;thread&gt;**. <br><br>![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) This extension attribute is not available. |


Remark: You can also use the code editor interface, via [Automatic procedures](../Editeurs/9000072.md).
<a name="NOTE3_2"></a>


### Access to existing elements and HFSQL context
<a name="access_existing_elements_and_hfsql_context_ELTPARAGRAPHE000192"></a>

When creating a thread, all the existing declarations, objects, elements are common:

- to the new secondary thread.

- to the thread in which the secondary thread was created (the main thread in most cases).




Therefore, these threads can access the variables, procedures, ... All the variables created once a thread is started are accessible in the thread where they have been created.

Similarly, when creating a thread, the ***HFSQL context*** is automatically duplicated. Each thread handles a specific HFSQL context. The number of HFSQL contexts is equal to the number of threads currently run. The entire HFSQL context is copied (filter, search condition, etc.). The HFSQL context evolves independently in each thread.

This allows you, for example, to perform two different iterations on the same data file in two different threads.

**Example**: 

- A filter is created on the Customer data file. 

- [ThreadExecute](../WDLang1/3077024.md) is called to create the CTX2 thread. 

- The Customer data file is filtered in each thread (main and CTX2). The filter will still be enabled in the CTX2 thread even if the filter is disabled in the main thread.




**Special cases**:

- **Assisted management of HFSQL errors**: If several threads are used on the data files, we advise you to customize the management of HFSQL errors to avoid displaying the default windows. To do so, use [HOnError](../WDLang4/3044017.md) to disable the automatic management of errors or to redirect the management of errors to a custom procedure (without displaying windows). For more details, see [Assisted HFSQL error handling](../WDLang4/3044188.md).

- **Write operations and assignments in a thread**: If values are written or assigned in a thread, the other running threads do not share this information. Some inconsistencies may occur.


Example:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| Code of Thread 1 | Code of Thread 2 |
| a=i<br>a++<br>i=a | b=i<br>b++<br>i=b |


These two threads share the variables but they do not manage the access to the common resources. If the thread 1 is run before the thread 2, i will be set to 1 instead of 2.

**Remark**: To share an assignment between several threads, you must use semaphores. For more details, see [Managing the semaphores in the threads](../WDLang1/3077013.md).

## Recommendations for the processes performed by the thread
<a name="recommendations_for_the_processes_performed_the_thread_ELTTEXTE000570"></a>


### Forbidden processes
<a name="forbidden_processes_ELTPARAGRAPHE000260"></a>

Caution: The following processes cannot be run in the threads:

- opening windows with WLanguage functions such as [Open](../WDLang1/3038035.md), [Use](../WDLang1/3038044.md), [Close](../WDLang1/3038018.md), ... A specific management mode must be implemented if some windows must be handled in threads (rare case). For more details, see [Opening a window in a secondary thread](../WDLang1/3077015.md).

- managing events.

- multitask.

- managing timers.

| --- |
| **Caution: UI elements (windows, controls, etc.) cannot be manipulated in a secondary thread.**<br> When a secondary thread must interact with the user or update the UI, it must use a process started from the main thread. This process can correspond to:<br><br>- a global procedure of the project or a local procedure (of a window, etc.) called by [ExecuteMainThread](../WDLang1/1000019862.md),<br><br>- the "Request for refreshing the display" event of a window run by [RequestRefreshUI](../WDLang1/1000023899.md).<br><br><br> |

### Processes of a WINDEV application
<a name="processes_windev_application_ELTPARAGRAPHE000297"></a>

By default, WINDEV events (click code of a button, for example), procedures and class methods can only be run by a single thread at a given time.

To allow several threads to run these processes at the same time, you must:

1. Change the default management mode of threads ([ThreadMode](../WDLang1/3077028.md)).

2. Manage critical sections and semaphores in the code of the application.




![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) In Java, events (click code of a button, for example), procedures and class methods can be run by several threads at the same time. To prevent several threads from running the same code at the same time, critical sections or semaphores must be added to the code of the application.
<a name="NOTE4_3"></a>


### Exception process and threads
<a name="exception_process_and_threads_ELTPARAGRAPHE000316"></a>

If a general exception process is set in the project initialization code, it will be triggered if an exception occurs:

- in the main thread, 

- in a secondary thread started by [ThreadExecute](../WDLang1/3077024.md).


However, if the secondary thread triggers an exception, it will not be possible to find out its origin with [ExceptionInfo](../WDLang1/3034006.md) in the project code. To find out the origin of an exception in a secondary thread, the exception process must be included in the secondary thread.
