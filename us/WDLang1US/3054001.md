Retrieves and/or changes the character set used:

- by all the screen fonts.

- by all the operations performed on the character strings (functions and/or operators).




This function allows you to manage all the languages that use specific character sets. The change of character set will be taken into account during the next opening of a window or page. We advise you to close and to re-open all the windows or pages.

**Remark**: The different fonts are available in different character sets. For example, the "Arial" font exists in the western character set as well as in the Greek or Hebrew character set.

## Remarks




### How to use a specific character set? 
<a name="how_use_specific_character_set_ELTPARAGRAPHE000364"></a>

To use a specific character set, you must:

1. Install the files that correspond to the desired character sets in the regional settings of Windows (control panel).

2. Use **ChangeCharset** in your program.



<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>




### Changing the character set used by the fonts
<a name="changing_the_character_set_used_the_fonts_ELTPARAGRAPHE000377"></a>

**ChangeCharset** modifies the character set used by all fonts. The fonts that use the desired character set must be installed on the current computer. 

**ChangeCharset** takes effect immediately. We advise you to close and re-open all the windows or pages. 
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) To apply this change to the current window, it is recommended to use [Use](../WDLang1/3038044.md) to force the window to reopen. 

For more details, see [Managing specific character sets in an application](../WDLang1/3054012.md).
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>




### Changing the character set used by the operations performed on the character strings
<a name="changing_the_character_set_used_the_operations_performed_the_character_strings_ELTPARAGRAPHE000412"></a>

**ChangeCharset** modifies the character set used by the operations performed on the character strings. This new character set will be taken into account:

- when comparing two strings according to the lexicographical order ([StringCompare](../WDLang1/3024011.md) associated with the *ccLexicographicOrder* constant). This comparison does not take the "double letters" into account (CH in Spanish or LJ in Croatian for example).

- in the HFSQL indexes (Classic mode or Client/Server mode) once the indexes have been built or rebuilt ([HCreation](../WDLang4/3044255.md), [HCreationIfNotFound](../WDLang4/3044254.md) or [HIndex](../WDLang4/3044133.md) associated with the *hChangeCharset* constant). The sort order in the indexes does not take the "double letters" into account (CH in Spanish or LJ in Croatian for example).




**ChangeCharset** takes effect immediately. We advise you to close and re-open all the windows or pages.
 
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) To apply this change to the current window, it is recommended to use [Use](../WDLang1/3038044.md) to force the window to reopen. 

For more details, see [Defining specific character sets in HFSQL data files](../WDLang1/3054017.md).
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>




### Changing the character set control by control
<a name="changing_the_character_set_control_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000463"></a>

You can also change the character set used control by control with the [FontCharset](../Proprietes/2510089.md) property.
<a name="NOTE0_5"></a>




### Using the charsetUTF8 constant
<a name="using_the_charsetutf8_constant_ELTPARAGRAPHE000474"></a>

The *charsetUTF8* constant is used to manage the countries with two character sets (Hong Kong) and the countries with no character set defined in Windows.

In this mode, if a Latin character set is used, the accented characters are not coded on one byte but on several bytes. A character can be coded on 4 bytes. 
This operating mode triggers specific effects when managing the character strings. 
For example, [Length](../WDLang1/3024031.md) does no longer return the number of characters but the number of bytes corresponding to the string. It is recommended to use [UnicodeToAnsi](../WDLang1/3024025.md) before performing specific operations on character strings.
