<a name="description"></a>
Starts a difference operation of the memory used by the application. This operation will be ended during the call to [dbgEndMemoryDiff](../WDLang1/1000018841.md). 

This debugging method is used to isolate the memory resources of an operation that should be neutral for the memory. This allows you to correct the code and to add the potential missing freeing statements (queries no longer used, global object no longer used during the rest of the execution, etc.).
