Starts the execution of a secondary thread. The statement is a non-locking statement: the two processes are run in parallel.

**Reminder**: A thread is a process run in parallel with the current application (main thread). This allows you to run a task in the background (e.g. backup, etc.).

## Example


```wl
ThreadExecute("Thread1", threadNormal, ThreadProcedure) 
...
// Call to a global method of a class
ThreadExecute("Thread2", threadNormal, CClass::GlobalMethod)
```
<a name="Example2"></a>

```wl
// Run a thread while passing parameters 
sDate is string 
sDate = DateSys()
// Run the thread
ThreadExecute("THREADNAME", threadNormal, "pExecQry", sDate)
```

```wl
// Details of the "pExecQry" procedure 
// This procedure expects a date as parameter of a query 
PROCEDURE pExecQry(sDate)
IF HExecuteQuery(Del_Date, hQueryDefault, sDate) = False THEN
	Error(HErrorInfo())
ELSE
	HReadFirst(Del_Date)
END
```

`<Result> = ThreadExecute(<Thread>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Thread variable)`**

## Remarks


### Characteristics of a thread created in WLanguage
<a name="characteristics_thread_created_wlanguage_ELTPARAGRAPHE000253"></a>

A thread created in WLanguage can only be a procedure or a class method. The thread cannot correspond to a WLanguage process (code of a control for example).

If the thread is a class method, **ThreadExecute** must be run from one of the processes of the class (constructor or method).
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Thread and HFSQL
<a name="thread_and_hfsql_ELTPARAGRAPHE000264"></a>

HFSQL contexts are automatically duplicated when **ThreadExecute** is executed: the number of HFSQL contexts is equal to the number of threads currently run. The entire HFSQL context is copied (filter, search condition, etc.). The HFSQL context evolves independently in each thread.

This allows you, for example, to perform two different iterations on the same data file in two different threads. 

Two methods can be used to copy HFSQL contexts: 

- Full copy of context (by default)

- Light copy of context. 




For more details on how HFSQL contexts are copied and their limits (depending on the database used), see [Management of HFSQL contexts](../WDChamp/1010029.md).

**Example**: 

- A filter is created on the Customer data file. 

- [ThreadExecute](../WDLang1/3077024.md) is called to create the CTX2 thread. 

- The Customer data file is filtered in each thread (main and CTX2). The filter will still be enabled in the CTX2 thread even if the filter is disabled in the main thread.




**Special cases**:

- **Assisted management of HFSQL errors**: If several threads are used on the data files, we advise you to customize the management of HFSQL errors to avoid displaying the default windows. To do so, use [HOnError](../WDLang4/3044017.md) to disable the automatic management of errors or to redirect the management of errors to a custom procedure (without displaying windows). For more details, see [Assisted HFSQL error handling](../WDLang4/3044188.md).

- **Write operations and assignments in a thread**: If values are written or assigned in a thread, the other running threads do not share this information. Some inconsistencies may occur.

### Characteristics of WLanguage procedure
<a name="characteristics_wlanguage_procedure_ELTPARAGRAPHE000292"></a>

**Caution**: The calls to [Info](../WDLang1/3021011.md), [Error](../WDLang1/3021013.md), ... lock all the threads currently run.

![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png)![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) The calls to [Info](../WDLang1/3021011.md), [Error](../WDLang1/3021013.md), ... do not lock the threads currently run.

**Remark**: The parameters passed to the procedure are passed by value and not by reference.

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) For more details on how to open a window from a secondary thread, see [Opening a window in a secondary thread](../WDLang1/3077015.md).
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>




### Lifecycle of a thread
<a name="lifecycle_thread_ELTPARAGRAPHE000325"></a>

The thread is automatically stopped at the end of the execution of the WLanguage procedure started by **ThreadExecute**. 

The thread is also stopped in the following cases: 

- if **ThreadExecute** is called from the code of a window, the thread will be stopped when the window is closed. 

- if **ThreadExecute** is called from a global process (initialization, explicit call in the main context), the thread will be stopped when the application is terminated. 

- if **ThreadExecute** is called in a class method, the thread is stopped when the object is destroyed. 




To force the execution of the thread in the main context, use the *threadGlobalContext* constant. 

To force the thread to stop, use [ThreadStop](../WDLang1/3077019.md). This function can be used to stop a thread from the main thread.

**Remark**: Make sure that the threads are stopped (by [ThreadState](../WDLang1/3077016.md) or [ThreadWait](../WDLang1/3077020.md)) before closing the windows or destroying the objects.  
<a name="NOTE0_5"></a>




### Error management
<a name="error_management_ELTPARAGRAPHE000362"></a>

A fatal error occurs in the following cases:

- if the procedure does not exist.

- if a thread with the same name is currently running.



<a name="NOTE0_6"></a>


### Forbidden processes
<a name="forbidden_processes_ELTPARAGRAPHE000573"></a>

Caution: The following processes cannot be run in the threads:

- opening windows with WLanguage functions such as [Open](../WDLang1/3038035.md), [Use](../WDLang1/3038044.md), [Close](../WDLang1/3038018.md), ... A specific management mode must be implemented if some windows must be handled in threads (rare case). For more details, see [Opening a window in a secondary thread](../WDLang1/3077015.md).

- managing events.

- multitask.

- managing timers.

| **Caution: UI elements (windows, controls, etc.) cannot be manipulated in a secondary thread.**<br> When a secondary thread must interact with the user or update the UI, it must use a process started from the main thread. This process can correspond to:<br><br>- a global procedure of the project or a local procedure (of a window, etc.) called by [ExecuteMainThread](../WDLang1/1000019862.md),<br><br>- the "Request for refreshing the display" event of a window run by [RequestRefreshUI](../WDLang1/1000023899.md).<br><br><br> |
