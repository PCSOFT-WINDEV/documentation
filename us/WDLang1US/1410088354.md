The **diagLibrary** type is used to define all the advanced characteristics of a library of preset shapes used by a Diagram Editor control. The characteristics of this library can be defined and changed using different WLanguage properties. 

**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

## Example


```wl
sFile is string = fTempDir() + [ fSep ] + "custom_library.wddiag"

// Creates a library entirely through programming
TempLibrary is Diagram

D1 is diagOval
D1.Width = 50
D1.Height = 50
D1.Background.Color = DarkRed
Add(TempLibrary.Shape, D1)

D2 is diagOval
D2.Width = 50
D2.Height = 70
D2.Background.Color = DarkGreen
Add(TempLibrary.Shape, D2)

// Use the shapes of the temporary diagram to create the library
// Saves the diagram to the disk
DiagramSave(TempLibrary, sFile)

// Load the diagram as a library
MyLibrary is diagLibrary
DiagramLoadLibrary(MyLibrary, sFile)
MyLibrary.Name = "Custom"

// Adds the library to the Diagram Editor control
Add(DIAGEDT_Diagram.Library, MyLibrary)

ToastDisplay("The custom library has been added to the list.")
```


<a name="Example2"></a>

```wl
MyDiagram is Diagram
// Populate a Looper control with all the shapes from all the libraries
FOR EACH Lib OF MyDiagram.Library
	FOR EACH Shape OF Lib
		imgShape is Image = DiagramShapeToImage(Shape)
		LooperAddLine(LOOP_MyLooper, Lib.Name, imgShape, Shape.Name)		
	END
END
```

## Properties


### Properties specific to diagLibrary variables
<a name="properties_specific_diaglibrary_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000028"></a>

The following properties can be used to handle **diagLibrary** variables:

| Property name | Type used | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Name | Character string | Name of the shape library. |
| Shape | Array of [diagShape](../WDLang1/1410088082.md) | Array of preset shapes. |






<a name="NOTE0"></a>

## Remarks
<a name="NOTE0_1"></a>


- By default, shape libraries are displayed in the left panel of the Diagram Editor control.

- The [Library](../Proprietes/1410088357.md) property of the Diagram Editor control corresponds to an array of variables of type **diagLibrary**.
