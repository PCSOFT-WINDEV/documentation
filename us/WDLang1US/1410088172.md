The **diagSelection** type is used to define all the advanced characteristics of a selection made in a diagram. The characteristics of this selection can be defined and changed using different WLanguage properties.

**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

## Example


```wl
// Retrieve the selected elements in a Diagram Editor control
MySelection is diagSelection <- DIAGEDT_MyDiagram.Selection
IF MySelection.Shape.Count > 0 THEN
	// Get the shapes
	FOR EACH stShape OF MySelection.Shape	
		STC_SELECTION_INFO = stShape.Name + "has been selected." + 
		" [ " + stShape.X + ", " + stShape.Y + " - " + stShape.Width + 
		"x" + stShape.Height + " ]"	
	END
ELSE
	STC_SELECTION_INFO = "Click a shape in the diagram to get the selection"
END
```

<a name="properties_specific_diagselection_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000028"></a>

The following properties can be used to handle a selection:

| Property name | Type used | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Angle | Real | Angle of rotation of the selection. |
| Background |   | <br><br>- Background color of the selected shape,<br><br>- -1 if no shape is selected or if multiple shapes are selected.  <br><br><br> |
| Border | [diagBorder](../WDLang1/1410088179.md) | Characteristics of the border of the selected shape. |
| Comment | Character string | Comment associated with the selection. |
| Height | Real | <br><br>- Height of the selection, expressed in pixels,<br><br>- -1 if no selection. <br><br><br> |
| Link | [diagConnector](../WDLang1/1410088454.md) | Characteristics of the selected connector. |
| Opacity | Integer | <br><br>- Opacity percentage of the selected shape. This value ranges from invisible (0) to completely opaque (100).<br><br>- -1 if no shape is selected.<br><br><br> |
| Round | Real | <br><br>- Curvature of the selected shape,<br><br>- -1 if the shape has no rounded corners or if multiple shapes are selected. <br><br><br> |
| Shadow | Boolean | <br><br>- <u><u><u>True</u></u></u> if the shape has a shadow, <br><br>- <u><u><u>False</u></u></u> otherwise.<br><br><br> |
| Shape | Array of [diagShape](../WDLang1/1410088082.md) | Shapes in the selection. |
| Text | [diagText](../WDLang1/1410088393.md) | Characteristics of the text of the selected shape. |
| Type | Integer constant | Type of the selected element |
| Width | Real | <br><br>- Width of the selection, expressed in pixels,<br><br>- -1 if no selection. <br><br><br> |
| X | Real | <br><br>- X-position of the box that contains the selection (expressed in pixels),<br><br>- -1 if no selection.<br><br><br> |
| Y | Real | <br><br>- Y-position of the box that contains the selection (expressed in pixels),<br><br>- -1 if no selection.<br><br><br> |
| ZOrder | Integer | Z-order of the selection. |
