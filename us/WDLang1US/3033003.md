## Remarks




### Exchange table
<a name="exchange_table_ELTPARAGRAPHE000070"></a>

An ***exchange table*** is stored in memory. Each currency is associated with:

- A currency number used to identify the currency by programming.

- A constant used to identify the currency by programming.

- A caption (up to 7 characters): this caption is displayed in the "Currency + Euro" control if the input mask allows it (the $ sign is indicated).

- An exchange rate. This exchange rate corresponds to the exchange rate of the currency in relation to the Euro.




This exchange table is as follows:

| Currency number | Constant | Country | Exchange rate | Default caption |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | *eEUR* | Euro zone | 1 | EURO |
| 1 | *eFRF* | France | 6.55957 | F |
| 2 | *eITL* | Italy | 1936.27 | ITL |
| 3 | *eBEF* | Belgium | 40.3399 | BEF |
| 4 | *eLUF* | Luxembourg | 40.3399 | LUF |
| 5 | *eDEM* | Germany | 1.95583 | DEM |
| 6 | *eATS* | Austria | 13.7603 | ATS |
| 8 | *eESP* | Spain | 166.386 | ESP |
| 9 | *eIEP* | Ireland | 0.787564 | IEP |
| 10 | *eNLG* | Netherlands | 2.20371 | NLG |
| 11 | *ePTE* | Portugal | 200.482 | PTE |
| 14 | *eGRD* | Greece | 340.750 | GRD |
| 15 | *eFIM* | Finland | 5.94573 | FIM |
| **Currencies not taking part in the Euro** |
|   |   |   |   |   |
| 7 | *eDKK* | Denmark | 0 | DKK |
| 12 | *eGBP* | Great Britain | 0 | GBP |
| 13 | *eSEK* | Sweden | 0 | SEK |
| 16 - 25 | - |   | 0 | Free1 to Free10 |
| 26 | *eCYP* | Cyprus | 0 | CYP |
| 27 | *eCZK* | Czech Republic | 0 | CZK |
| 28 | *eEEK* | Estonia | 0 | EEK |
| 29 | *eHUF* | Hungary | 0 | HUF |
| 30 | *eLTL* | Lithuania | 0 | LTL |
| 31 | *eLVL* | Latvia | 0 | LVL |
| 32 | *eMTL* | Malta | 0 | MTL |
| 33 | *ePLN* | Poland | 0 | SCH |
| 34 | *eSIT* | Slovenia | 0 | SIT |
| 35 | *eSKK* | Slovakia | 0 | SKK |

The first currency (whose identifier is set to 0) is the currency used as reference for the conversions.

**Caution**: The currencies whose exchange rate is set to 0 will not be displayed in the popup menu of the "Currency + Euro" control.

### Redefining currencies
<a name="redefining_currencies_ELTPARAGRAPHE000370"></a>

When redefining currencies, we recommend that you keep the order of currencies defined in the exchange table. Indeed, the lists of currencies defined in the different editors are based on this order.

Therefore, if currency #3 (corresponding to the Belgium Franc) is redefined through programming to correspond to the Peseta, the window/page editor will still display the Belgium Franc in third position for currencies. However, at run time, the third currency will be the Peseta.

### Initializing the reference currency
<a name="initializing_the_reference_currency_ELTPARAGRAPHE000380"></a>

**eInitCurrency** cannot be used to initialize the reference currency (whose identifier is set to 0).
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>




### New currencies
<a name="new_currencies_ELTPARAGRAPHE000390"></a>

If new currencies are participating in the Euro, **eInitCurrency** allows you to take these new currencies into account in your applications via the "User-defined currencies" (numbered from 16 to 25).

The use of these "User-defined currencies" enables you to access new currencies in the window editor and in the page editor (in "Display Currency" and "Stored Currency").
