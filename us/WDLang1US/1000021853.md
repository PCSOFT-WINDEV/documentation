## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000353"></a>
By default, WINDEV applications allow end users to modify the interface of the application. 

End users can decide whether some elements should be in the application, they can modify and adapt the windows to their own use. 

Today, everybody customizes their smartphone screen, why not do the same with their applications?

<a name="NOTE2"></a>
<a name="NOTE2_1"></a>


## Principle
<a name="principle_ELTTEXTE000377"></a>
When end-user modification of the interface is enabled, several new options appear at runtime: 

- **Customize the interface** (option in the context menu of the window): Allows the end user to customize the interface of the window (see below). ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=IMH_Modifiable_1%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)


- **Repositionable notes** (option in the context menu of the window): Allows the end user to add repositionable notes in the window. ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=IMH_Modifiable_1%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif)
For more details, see [Repositionable note (AAF)](../Editeurs/1000021820.md). 




For some types of controls, an option in the context menu is used to modify the control tooltip ("Edit the tooltip" option). 

**Remarks**: 

- The menu options appear only if the AAF menu is enabled on the window. 
	Reminder: To enable the AAF menu: 

	- Open the "UI" tab of the window description. 

	- Expand the "Context menu" option and check "Display the AAF menu (System)".




- During the test of a window or project (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Ico_Go_Fenetre_WD_bl.gif)
 and ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_GO_Projet_WD.gif)
), the options for modifying the interface are also available. If these options are used, WINDEV automatically proposes, at the end of test, to include the modifications performed in the current window. For more details, see [Using the GUI modification when running a project or window test](../WDLang1/1000021927.md). 





### Customize interface
<a name="customize_interface_ELTPARAGRAPHE000066"></a>

If the option "Customize interface" is selected, you have the ability to switch to modification mode ("Change to edit mode" sub-option). 

In this mode, the user can perform all operations allowed by the developer: 

- Select one or more controls,

- Move one or more controls,

- Create a wire between several controls,

- Edit the tooltip of controls.




You also have the ability to manage the current modifications: 

- **Import a customization**: Imports a customization that was exported beforehand (\*.wdmodif file).  

- **Export the customization of this window**: Exports the customization of current window via a file in ".wdmodif" format. 

- **Export all customizations of application**: Exports the customization of application via a file in ".wdmodif" format.

- **Restore the initial configuration**: Restores the initial configuration implemented by the developer. 




**Remark**: The "\*.wdmodif" export file can be directly opened in the WINDEV editor. In this case, the editor proposes to apply the modifications saved in the corresponding windows to the current project.

## Implementation and configuration
<a name="implementation_and_configuration_ELTTEXTE000407"></a>


### Implementation
<a name="implementation_ELTPARAGRAPHE000091"></a>

By default, all WINDEV applications created or compiled from version 21 allow end users to modify the UI. 

These options can be configured: 

- in the project. The options will be taken into account for all the project windows. 
	To configure the end-user UI modification: 

	1. Open the project description window: on the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, click "Description".

	2. In the "Advanced" tab, check "Allow end users to modify the UI". 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=IMH_Modifiable_2%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif&type=thumb)


	3. The "Options" button is used to specify the authorized options. 

- for each window. The options will be taken into account for the selected window only. 

	1. Open the window description ("Description" from the window context menu).  

	2. In the "Details" tab, check "Allow end users to modify the UI". ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=IMH_Modifiable_2%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif)


	3. The "Options" button is used to specify the authorized options. 




Remark: By default, the setting of windows corresponds to the project setting. 


### Setting for the project and windows
<a name="setting_for_the_project_and_windows_ELTPARAGRAPHE000135"></a>

The options for configuring the UI are as follows: 

- **No modification**. Automatically unchecks the option "Allow end users to modify the UI". End users will not be able to modify the interface of the application. 
	Remarks: 

	- The repositionable notes can no longer be used by the end user. 

	- The options for modifying the interface are no longer available when running the executable. These options are still available in GO mode. 




- **By default**. Displays and gives the ability to use the default options. The "Show" button is used to display the default options. These options cannot be modified. 

- **Specific settings**: Used to define the options for the project or for the window. If a specific setting is performed for the project, these options are automatically applied to the windows. 





### Available options
<a name="available_options_ELTPARAGRAPHE000165"></a>The available options for modifying the UI are as follows: 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=IMH_Modifiable_2%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.gif)


- **Options regarding the controls**: 

	- Select: The user can select a control.

## Programming and advanced features
<a name="programming_and_advanced_features_ELTTEXTE000443"></a>


### Overview
<a name="overview_ELTPARAGRAPHE000235"></a>

Several WLanguage properties and functions can be used to implement and manage the modification of UI by the end user. 

These functions allow you to describe an editor in WLanguage, with support for undo/redo. 


### Configuring the options for UI modification through programming
<a name="configuring_the_options_for_modification_through_programming_ELTPARAGRAPHE000242"></a>

To configure the options for UI modification through programming: 

1. Use [WinEditMode](../Proprietes/1000021824.md) to configure the actions allowed on a window and its controls when the window switches to "Allow end users to modify the UI" mode. 

2. Use [WinEditAllowed](../Proprietes/1000021850.md) to configure the actions allowed on a control when the window switches to "Allow end users to modify the UI" mode




Remark: To prevent window UI modifications, use [AAFDisable](../WDLang1/1000022018.md) with the *aafCustomizeUI* constant. In this case, the context menu "Customize interface" will no longer be available. 


### WLanguage functions for managing UI modification
<a name="wlanguage_functions_for_managing_modification_ELTPARAGRAPHE000261"></a>

These functions can be grouped by theme: 

- Functions for activation and backup: 
	


|   |   |

| [WinEdDeclareUndo](../WDLang1/1000021898.md) | Declares how to cancel an action that was added by [WinEdDo](../WDLang1/1000021897.md). |
| [WinEdDo](../WDLang1/1000021897.md) | Runs an action (defined through programming) with support for Undo/Redo. |
| [WinEdRedo](../WDLang1/1000021905.md) | Runs the last action canceled by the end user when modifying the interface (Mode "UI modification by end user" enabled). |
| [WinEdUndo](../WDLang1/1000021904.md) | Cancels the last action performed by the end user when modifying the interface (Mode "UI modification by end user" enabled). |





### How to find out the type of modification performed by the user? 
<a name="how_find_out_the_type_modification_performed_the_user_ELTPARAGRAPHE000278"></a>

A specific event is run when the user performs an interface modification (select, move or resize). 

To find out the type of modification, simply associate an event to the un interface modification. This operation can also be performed by [Process](../Proprietes/1000020878.md) and by the following constants: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *trtWinEdChangeSize* | Event run when resizing controls. |
| *trtWinEdMove* | Event run when moving controls. |
| *trtWinEdSelection* | Event run when selecting controls. |


Remark: In the procedure called by [Process](../Proprietes/1000020878.md), you also have the ability to perform a specific process according to the modifications performed by the user.
