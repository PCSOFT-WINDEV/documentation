Detects the modifications performed on the content of a directory. Only the modifications performed on the files found in the directory are detected. If a change is made, a specific procedure is executed in a thread.

## Example


```wl
// Name of directory to track
sDirectoryName is string = "C:\Temp\MyDir"
// The fTrackDirectory_Callback procedure will be called 
// when a file or directory in the "C:\Temp\MyDir" directory is modified.  
IF fTrackDirectory(sDirectoryName, fTrackDirectory_Callback, ftCreateFile + ...
		ftModifyFile + ftDeleteFile + ftRename) THEN
	// Inform the user that the directory will be tracked
	Info("The " + sDirectoryName + " directory will be tracked.")
ELSE
	// Inform the user that the directory will not be tracked
	Info("The " + sDirectoryName + " directory will not be tracked.")
END
```



```wl
// Code of the procedure
PROCEDURE fTrackDirectory_Callback(sDirectoryName, sFileName, nAction, sOldFileName)
ExecuteMainThread(AddTable,sDirectoryName, sFileName, nAction, sOldFileName)
```



```wl
// Procedure that acts on the main thread
PROCEDURE AddTable(sDirectoryName, sFileName, nAction, sOldFileName)

sActionDesignation is string
// The designation of the action depends on nAction
SWITCH nAction
	CASE ftCreateFile: sActionDesignation = "Creating files"
	CASE ftDeleteFile: sActionDesignation = "Deleting files"
	CASE ftModifyFile: sActionDesignation = "Modifying files"
	CASE ftRename: sActionDesignation = "Renaming files"	
END
// Add a line containing the information about the modification
// into the TABLE_MODIFICATIONS table
TableAddLine(TABLE_MODIFICATIONS, sDirectoryName, sFileName, , ...
		sActionDesignation, sOldFileName)
```

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = fTrackDirectory(<Directory to track> , <WLanguage procedure> [, <Modifications to notify> [, <Subdirectory>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the directory is tracked, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md).




**`<Directory to track>: (Character string)`**

Full name of the directory to track.

**`<WLanguage procedure>: (Procedure name)`**

Name of the WLanguage procedure ("callback") called when a change is made in the specified directory.

For more details on this procedure, see [Parameters of the procedure used by fTrackDirectory](../WDLang1/1000025350.md).

**`<Modifications to notify>: (Optional Integer constant (or combination of constants))`**

Modifications performed in the content of the directory to track and for which the procedure must be run: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *ftAll* | All the possible actions will be tracked. Corresponds to *ftCreateFile* + *ftModifyFile* + *ftRename* + *ftDeleteFile*. |
| *ftCreateFile* | Creating a file or a directory. |
| *ftDeleteFile* | Deleting a file or a directory. |
| *ftModifyFile* | Modifying a file or a directory. |
| *ftRename* | Renaming a file or a directory. |



**`<Subdirectory>: (Boolean)`**

## Remarks


### Special cases
<a name="special_cases_ELTPARAGRAPHE000090"></a>

- **fTrackDirectory** only monitors the contents of the directory. The changes of directory name or location are ignored.  

- To stop tracking the directory, use [fTrackStop](../WDLang1/1000020575.md) and [fTrackStopAll](../WDLang1/1000020576.md).

- To track the modifications performed in a file, use [fTrackFile](../WDLang1/1000020522.md). 

- Limitation: Only 5 directories can be tracked at the same time.

### WLanguage procedure
<a name="wlanguage_procedure_ELTPARAGRAPHE000111"></a>

The WLanguage procedure is run in a WLanguage thread.
Caution: The following processes cannot be run in the threads:

- opening windows with WLanguage functions such as [Open](../WDLang1/3038035.md), [Use](../WDLang1/3038044.md), [Close](../WDLang1/3038018.md), ... A specific management mode must be implemented if some windows must be handled in threads (rare case). For more details, see [Opening a window in a secondary thread](../WDLang1/3077015.md). 

- managing events.

- managing timers.




For more details on threads, see [Managing threads](../WDLang1/3077026.md).
