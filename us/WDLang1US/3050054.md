The financial functions are as follows:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [FinCurrentVal](../WDLang1/3050055.md) | Returns the current value of investment. |
| [FinDecreasingRedemption](../WDLang1/3050068.md) | Calculates the amortization value of a good over a specific period of time, via the formula for fixed-rate decreasing amortization. |
| [FinError](../WDLang1/3050071.md) | Returns the number of the last error caused by a Finxxx function ([financial functions](../WDLang1/3050054.md)). |
| [FinFutureVal](../WDLang1/3050056.md) | Returns the future value of an investment. |
| [FinInterestRate](../WDLang1/3050047.md) | Calculates the interest rate for a loan over a specific period of time with fixed payments. |
| [FinLinearRedemption](../WDLang1/3050046.md) | Calculates the value of linear amortization of a product over a specific period of time. |
| [FinNetCurrentVal](../WDLang1/3050053.md) | Returns the net current value of investment. |
| [FinPaymentNb](../WDLang1/3050041.md) | Returns the number of payments required to pay off a capital according to a given rate. |
