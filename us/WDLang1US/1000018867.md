### Associating an application with a file extension
<a name="associating_application_with_file_extension_ELTPARAGRAPHE000046"></a>

To associate an application with a file extension via the registry, you must create the following keys:

- "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\.ext": 
	where **ext** is the extension. 
	The default value corresponds to the type of file (free string).

- "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\type_name": 
	where **type_name** is the name of the type given to the extension.
	The default value corresponds to the description that will be displayed in the "Type" column of the Windows explorer.

- "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\type_name\\shell\\open\\command": 
	The default value is the command that will be run by [ShellExecute](../WDLang1/3035007.md) on this type of file. In the command line, the %1 string will be replaced by the path of the file.
