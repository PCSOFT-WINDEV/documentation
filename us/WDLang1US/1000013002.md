The following functions can be used in the code of an automated test:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [TestAddIteration](../WDLang1/1000017015.md) | Adds an iteration into the current test and gives the values of test parameters for this iteration. |
| [TestCheck](../WDLang1/1000017023.md) | Writes a result into the status report of a test according to the result of a boolean expression. |
| [TestCheckDifferent](../WDLang1/1000023397.md) | Checks whether the specified expressions are different in assertive programming and in automated test mode. |
| [TestCheckEqual](../WDLang1/1000023398.md) | Checks whether the expressions are equal in assertive programming and in automated test mode. |
| [TestCheckFalse](../WDLang1/1000023399.md) | Checks whether an expression is false in assertive programming and in automated test mode. |
| [TestCheckNotNull](../WDLang1/1000023400.md) | Checks whether an expression is not Null in assertive programming and in automated test mode. |
| [TestCheckNull](../WDLang1/1000023401.md) | Checks whether an expression is Null in assertive programming and in automated test mode. |
| [TestCheckTrue](../WDLang1/1000023402.md) | Checks whether an expression is set to True in assertive programming and in automated test mode. |
| [TestError](../WDLang1/1000023506.md) | Provokes: <br><br>- an assertion during the test of element or project (Go mode). <br><br>- an error in automated test mode.<br><br><br> |
| [TestOnError](../WDLang1/1000023507.md) | Provokes: <br><br>- an assertion during the test of element or project (Go mode). <br><br>- an error in automated test mode.<br><br><br> |
| [TestWriteResult](../WDLang1/1000013001.md) | Writes information or an error into the status report of a unit test, in the test editor. |



Remark: In the code of an automated test, it is also possible to use the statement [ON](../Motscles/1511020.md).
