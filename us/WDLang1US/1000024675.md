## Example


```wl
// Create/Open a memory area shared between applications (1st application)
arrZoneID is associative array of int
Zone1ID is int
Zone1ID = fMemOpen("MySharedZone", 1024, shareGlobal, ...
		foReadWrite, ModificationProcedure)
arrZoneID["MySharedZone"] = Zone1ID
...
// Create/Open a memory area shared 
// between applications (2nd application) - 
// no callback
Zone2ID is int
Zone2ID = fMemOpen("MySharedZone", 1024, shareGlobal)
// Write into the shared memory area
fWrite(Zone2ID, "Hello, I am a WINDEV application!")
...
// The writing performed by the 2nd application triggers 
// the call to the procedure in the 1st application
```

```wl
// -------------------------
// Procedure called whenever the shared memory area is modified
PROCEDURE ModificationProcedure(NameNotifZone is string)
ModifiedString is string
ModifiedString = fRead(arrZoneID[NameNotifZone], 1024)
Trace(StringBuild("The %1 string was written into the %2 zone", ModifiedString, NameNotifZone))

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`fMemOpen_Callback([<Zone name>])`
---

**`<Zone name>: (Optional character string)`**

This optional parameter must be used when a unique callback is used to receive the notifications of several shared memory areas

Depending on how the memory area is created, this parameter can be prefixed: 

- with the "Global\\" string if the zone has been created with the *shareGlobal* constant. 

- with the "Local\\" string if the zone has been created with the *shareUser* constant.
