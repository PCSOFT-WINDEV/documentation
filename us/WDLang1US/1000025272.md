Displays a message in a standard non-blocking dialog box with the answers "Yes" and "No" and calls a WLanguage procedure with the user's response. 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=fonctions_dialogue%20-%20HC%20N%B0007.gif)


Remarks: 

- **This is a non-blocking dialog box**. The WLanguage code that follows the call to **YesNoAsynchronous** continues to run. To close the window, the user must validate one of the buttons. When the user clicks one of the buttons, the code of a WLanguage procedure is run.

- In the WLanguage code following the call to the function, another modal window cannot be opened before closing the dialog box. 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) WINDEV allows you to apply the skin template of your project to this dialog box. For more details, see [Customizing dialog boxes](../WDLang1/3021003.md).
