### Progress Bar
<a name="progress_bar_ELTPARAGRAPHE000120"></a>

In Windows, to view the progress of file decompression, use [Event](../WDLang1/3015011.md) to process the <u><u><u><u>CompressProgressBar</u></u></u></u> message (1174). When this message is received, the _EVE.wParam variable contains the percentage of file decompression.
