A **List** variable is a structured type that is used to group a set of elements of the same type. The elements can be added at the end of the list or they can be inserted into the list.

## Syntax

### Declaring and initializing a list

`<List Name> is List of <Type of List Elements>`
---

**`<List name>: ()`**

Name of the List variable to declare.

**`<Type of List Elements>: ()`**

Type of the elements found in the list. 
All types of variables can be used including the arrays, the associative arrays, the queues, the stacks and the lists. For example: 


```txt
<variable> is List of arrays of int

<variable> is List of fixed arrays of 5 int

<variable> is List of associative arrays of int

<variable> is List of Queues of int

<variable> is List of Stacks of int

<variable> is List of Lists of int
```

## Remarks


### WLanguage properties that can be used with the List type
<a name="wlanguage_properties_that_can_used_with_the_list_type_ELTPARAGRAPHE000063"></a>

The following properties can be used to handle a List variable. 

| Property name | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| [Empty](../Proprietes/2510126.md) | <br><br>- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the list is empty, <br><br>- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise.<br><br><br> |
| [Occurrence](../Proprietes/2510097.md) | Returns the number of occurrences of the List variable. |

### WLanguage functions for managing lists
<a name="wlanguage_functions_for_managing_lists_ELTPARAGRAPHE000092"></a>The following functions can be used to handle a List variable. 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [Add](../WDLang1/1000017348.md) | Adds an element in last position: <br><br>- of a one-dimensional WLanguage array. <br><br>- of an advanced array property (array of events of gglCalendar, etc.). <br><br>- from a WLanguage list.<br><br><br> |
| [Delete](../WDLang1/1000017354.md) | Deletes an element at a given position: <br><br>- from a one-dimensional WLanguage array. <br><br>- from an advanced array property (array of gglCalendar events, etc.). <br><br>- from an associative array. <br><br>- from a WLanguage list.<br><br><br> |
| [DeleteAll](../WDLang1/1000017357.md) | Deletes all the elements: <br><br>- from a one-dimensional or two-dimensional WLanguage array. <br><br>- from an associative array. <br><br>- from an advanced array property (array of gglCalendar events, etc.). <br><br>- from a WLanguage queue.<br><br>- from a WLanguage stack. <br><br>- from a WLanguage list.<br><br><br> |
| [Deserialize](../WDLang1/3013066.md) | Deserializes a buffer or a character string containing the data from a class, structure, array (including an associative array), queue, stack, list or advanced variable, as well as their subelements. |
| [Insert](../WDLang1/1000017351.md) | Inserts an element at a given position: <br><br>- into a one-dimensional WLanguage array. <br><br>- into an associative array. <br><br>- into an advanced array property (array of gglCalendar events, etc.). <br><br>- into a WLanguage list.<br><br><br> |
| [ListInfo](../WDLang1/1000019548.md) | Retrieves the characteristics of a WLanguage list: types of elements and number of elements. |
| [Serialize](../WDLang1/3013065.md) | Transforms the following elements into a specific format:<br><br>- a structure (and its subelements),<br><br>- a class (and its subelements),<br><br>- an array (including the associative arrays),<br><br>- a queue,<br><br>- a stack, <br><br>- a list. <br><br><br> |

### The lists and the multithread
<a name="the_lists_and_the_multithread_ELTPARAGRAPHE000100"></a>

The management of multithread is taken into account when adding, inserting and deleting an element.

You also have the ability to use properties during a multithread management but the result is not permanent. For example:


```wl
IF MyList.Occurrence > 0 THEN
	// The list may be empty when the thread reaches this point
END
```

<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Browsing the lists
<a name="browsing_the_lists_ELTPARAGRAPHE000111"></a>

The FOR EACH syntax can be used to browse the lists.

The syntax used corresponds to the one used for the arrays:


```txt
FOR EACH [ELEMENT] <Variable> [, <Counter> [, <Counter>]] OF <List> [<Direction>]
	...
END
```
The elements can be modified during the browse. If the list is modified during a browse, the browse is affected by the additions and by the deletions. The functions available during the browse are as follows:

- Syntax 1: 
	
	```txt
	Insert(<List Name>, BeforeCurrentElement, <Value>)
	```

	Caution: the element will be read in the next iteration in a descending loop.

- Syntax 2: 
	
	```txt
	Insert(<List Name>, AfterCurrentElement, <Value>)
	```

	Caution: the element will be read in the next iteration in an ascending loop.

- Syntax 3: 
	
	```txt
	Delete(List Name, CurrentElement)
	```

### Special cases
<a name="special_cases_ELTPARAGRAPHE000137"></a>

- The content of the list can be displayed in the debugger. 

- A list can be used to type a procedure parameter.

- A list can be copied by the = operator. You also have the ability to copy an instance of class or structure containing a list.

- A list can be initialized by a list of elements.
