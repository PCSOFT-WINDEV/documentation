IF SpellAvailable() = True AND SpellCheck(Word) = False THEN

## Syntax

`<Result> = SpellSuggest(<Word to Check>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Character string)`**

Can correspond to: 

- The list of correct words close to the word to check. The list has the following format: 
	
	```txt
	<Correct Word 1> +  CR + <Correct Word 2>  + CR + ...
	```


- An empty string ("") if no error occurred or if no proposition is available. If an error occurred, [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) is used to find out the reason for the error (if the dictionary of OpenOffice is not installed for instance). 




**`<Word to Check>: (Character string)`**

Word that must be checked by the spelling checker of OpenOffice.
