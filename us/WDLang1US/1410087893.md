The **sysNotification** type is used to define all the advanced characteristics of an interactive system notification. The characteristics of this notification can be defined and changed using different WLanguage properties. 

**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

### Notification example
<a name="notification_example_ELTPARAGRAPHE000028"></a>

Here is an example of a notification: ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=NOTIF_FR.gif)


- 1: Application icon and name: This information cannot be modified. 

- 2: Notification header image (**HeaderImagePath** property of the **sysNotification** variable). 

- 3: Logo image: Default application logo. This logo can be replaced with an image (**LogoImagePath** property of the **sysNotification** variable). You can also crop this image into a circle (**LogoImageCrop** property of the **sysNotification** variable). 

- 4: Title: Notification title or name (2 lines maximum, **Title** property of the **sysNotification** variable).

- 5: Additional text: 2 additional text areas, taking no more than a total of 4 lines (**Text1** and **Text2** properties of the **sysNotification** variable). 

- 6: Date and time the notification was sent (**Date** property of the **sysNotification** variable).

- 7: Attribution, which indicates the source of the information: SMS, ...  (**Attribution** property of the **sysNotification** variable). 

- 8: Image contained in the notification. This optional image is displayed when the notification is expanded (**ContentImagePath** property of the **sysNotification** variable).

- 9: Edit control where the user can enter text (defined by the [sysNotificationInput](../WDLang1/1410088024.md) variable). 

- 10: Combo Box where the user can select an option (defined by the [sysNotificationInput](../WDLang1/1410088024.md) variable).

- 11: Simple button, which can perform an action defined by the system or send information back to the calling application (defined by the [sysNotificationButton](../WDLang1/1410087947.md) variable). You can also define a context button, which is added to the context menu of the notification (right click).




Remark: simple buttons always appear at the bottom of the notification. However, Edit and Combo Box controls appear in the order they have been defined.

| Property name | Type used | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |

| Attribution | Character string | Text to be displayed in the small text area below the notification (for example, this box can be used to indicate the source of the information). <br><br>This property can be empty. |
| Buttons | Array of [sysNotificationButton](../WDLang1/1410087947.md) | Button controls of the notification. Buttons always appear at the bottom of the notification, from left to right following their order in the array (except for context buttons, which are added to the context menu of the notification, from top to bottom).<br><br>Caution: There can be no more than 5 buttons in a notification. |

| Inputs | Array of [sysNotificationInput](../WDLang1/1410088024.md) | "User input" controls of the notification. These can be either "text input" or "combo box" controls. <br><br>The controls appear from top to bottom in the order they were added to the array.<br><br>Caution : There can be no more than 4 input controls in a notification.

A "reminder" sound alert defined by the system is played in a loop.<br><br>- *sysNotifCall*: The notification stays on screen until the user interacts with it. An incoming call sound defined by the system is played in a loop, and a different style is used for the buttons.<br><br>- *sysNotifStandard* (default value): The notification appears on screen for a few seconds before going into the Windows Action Center.<br><br>- *sysNotifReminder*: The notification stays on screen until the user interacts with it.

| XML | Character string | XML code that corresponds to the current configuration of the notification.<br><br>In write mode : This property allows you to specify an XML description of the notification. If this property is specified, all the other properties of the **sysNotification** type will be ignored. <br><br>In read mode: This property is used to get the XML code generated by WINDEV corresponding to the notification. <br><br>For more information on the XML format of Windows notifications, see : [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/shell/tiles-and-notifications/adaptive-interactive-toasts?tabs=xml](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/shell/tiles-and-notifications/adaptive-interactive-toasts?tabs=xml) |
