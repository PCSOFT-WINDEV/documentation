## Syntax

`ScreenFirst([<Control used> [, <Index>]])`
---

**`<Control used>: (Optional control name)`**

Name of control (including columns of a Table control) or window that will be in edit mode. 
If this parameter corresponds to the name of a window, the window will be activated and a control that can gain focus will be in edit.
If this parameter corresponds to a control that cannot take focus (invisible control, static control, and so on), the input will start from the next control according to the tab order.

**`<Index>: (Optional integer)`**

Index for an indexed control.

## Remarks


### Focus gain
<a name="focus_gain_ELTPARAGRAPHE000066"></a>

When a control gains focus, this is indicated in different ways depending on the type of the control:

- Blinking cursor (or "Caret") for the edit controls.

- Dotted rectangle for the other types of controls (Button, List Box, Radio Button controls, etc.).




**Caution**: Some types of controls cannot take focus ("Static" controls for example).

### ScreenFirst used with a window
<a name="docparampagetitleshort_used_with_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000078"></a>

If &lt;Control name&gt; corresponds to the name of a window, the window becomes active. The control that will gain focus in this window will correspond to:

- the last control previously in edit in this window,

- the first control that can gain focus in this window (if no data was previously entered).



<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Events executed when ScreenFirst is used
<a name="events_executed_when_docparampagetitleshort_used_ELTPARAGRAPHE000089"></a>

In most cases, exit events (from the current control or window) and entry events (in the specified control or window) are run when **ScreenFirst** is called.

Exception to this rule: The exit code of the selected control is not run if **ScreenFirst** is used in one of the events of this control.

### ScreenFirst, SetFocus and SetFocusAndReturnToUserInput
<a name="docparampagetitleshort_setfocus_and_setfocusandreturntouserinput_ELTPARAGRAPHE000104"></a>

These functions have a different behavior:

- [SetFocusAndReturnToUserInput](../WDLang1/1410088107.md) stops the current process to force the input in the specified control. 

- **ScreenFirst** defines which control will receive input focus (when the current code stops and input focus is set back to a control).

- [SetFocus](../WDLang1/3025001.md) stops the current process, defines which control will receive input focus and resumes the current process.

### Error
<a name="error_ELTPARAGRAPHE000122"></a>

A WLanguage error occurs if &lt;Control name&gt; does not correspond to a control found in the current window.

### Indexed control
<a name="indexed_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000131"></a>&lt;Index&gt; allows you to specify the index of an indexed control. You can also use the name of the indexed control. For example:


```wl
ScreenFirst(EDT_Edit1, 1) = ScreenFirst(EDT_Edit1[1])
```
