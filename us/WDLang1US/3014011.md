| [COMQueryInterface](../WDLang1/1000019784.md) | Calls the QueryInterface method of the specified COM object to get a specific interface of this object so that it can be used with [COMCallMethod](../WDLang1/1000018832.md). |
| [CreateShortcut](../WDLang1/3014008.md) | Creates a shortcut on the Windows desktop, in the "Start" menu of Windows or in a specific directory. |
| [DeleteShortcut](../WDLang1/3014012.md) | Deletes a shortcut previously created by [CreateShortcut](../WDLang1/3014008.md) from the Windows desktop, from the "Start" menu of Windows or from a specific directory. |
| [FreeDLL](../WDLang1/3014009.md) | Frees the 32-bit library (DLL) that was loaded in memory by [LoadDLL](../WDLang1/3014006.md). |

| [IBANValid](../WDLang1/1410089019.md) | Checks the validity of an International Bank Acount Number (IBAN). |
| [IconInstall](../WDLang1/3014016.md) | Creates an icon (associated with a program) in a group of Windows programs, with the associated command line. |
| [Instance](../WDLang1/3014019.md) | Returns the "system handle" (HINSTANCE) of the current program. |

| [LoWord](../WDLang1/3014018.md) | Returns the two low bytes of an integer. |
| [MakeInteger](../WDLang1/3062016.md) | Builds a 4-byte integer from two 2-byte integers. |
| [OpenSSLCheck](../WDLang1/1000020432.md) | Checks, via a public key, that the signature of data performed with the OpenSSL library is correct. |
| [Ping](../WDLang1/3014013.md) | Checks whether a network address can be reached by using the ICMP protocol (similar to the PING network utility). |
| [sComputeCrc16](../WDLang1/3062007.md) | Checks a character string before and after transmission between WINDEV applications and WEBDEVsites. |

You also have the ability to use the following types of variables: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [API description](../WDLang1/1000019149.md) | An **API Description** variable is used to describe an API, its parameters, its return value and its calling options by programming. |

- ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WDSystemAPIs.gif) ***Training (WINDEV)*** : **WD SystemAPIs** <br>This example presents the use of the Windows APIs. Several WLanguage functions are used to perform the following operations:<br><br>	- Hide the system buttons of an MDI child window<br>	- Enumerate the opened windows<br>	- Retrieve/Modify the time of a double click<br>	- Retrieve the idle time on the computer<br>	- Empty the recycle bin (by using or not an "API descriptor" variable)<br>	- Change the screen background<br>	- Modify the caret (input cursor) of an edit control<br>	- Share a directory<br>	- Delete a share<br><br>These functions use the Windows APIs. See the help window for more details.
