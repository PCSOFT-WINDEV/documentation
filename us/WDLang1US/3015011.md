<a name="description"></a>
Intercepts a Windows event on a control, a group of controls or a WINDEV or WINDEV Mobile window. A specific WLanguage procedure is automatically run when the event is triggered on the specified object. To end the management of the event, all you have to do is use [EndEvent](../WDLang1/3015010.md).

**Remark**: **Event** does not operate on a non-WINDEV window.

## Example
<a class="notetitle" target="_blank" href="$DOC$=1000003015011&name=event_function&product=WD">See additional examples</a>

```wl
// Capture the mouse click on an edit control 
WM_LBUTTONDOWN is int = 513
Event(MouseClick, "EDT_EDIT1", WM_LBUTTONDOWN)
```

```wl
// MouseClick procedure 
PROCEDURE MouseClick()
EDT_EDIT1 = ""   // Reset the control to 0 when it is clicked
```

## Syntax

`<Result> = Event(<WLanguage procedure> , <Object name> , <Windows message>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**



- Identifier of event,

- 0 if an error occurs.




**`<WLanguage procedure>: (Procedure name)`**

Name of WLanguage procedure that will be run when intercepting the event. This procedure can be a global procedure of the project or a local procedure of the window that contains the code currently run. This function must comply with a specific standard (see the Remarks). 
For a given object, a single procedure can intercept a given event.

**`<Object name>: (Character string)`**

Name of control, group of controls or WINDEV window on which the event will be managed. You also have the ability to use the following generic character strings:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| **&lt;Window name&gt;.\*** | The event is managed for all the controls found in &lt;Window name&gt; (except for &lt;Window name&gt; itself). |
| **.\* (dot star)** | The event is managed for all the controls found in the current window (except for the window itself). |
| **\*. (star dot)** | The event is managed in all WINDEV windows of current application. |
| **\*.\* (star dot star)** | The event is managed in all WINDEV windows and in all controls of all opened WINDEV windows found in the current application. |



**`<Windows message>: (Integer or character string)`**

Number or name of Windows message to manage. See the [list of Windows events](../AppelDLL/6510001.md). Remark: The Windows constants can be directly included in your WLanguage code via the [EXTERN](../Motscles/1511013.md) keyword. 
If this parameter corresponds to a character string, this string is case-sensitive.  
If this parameter corresponds to 0, all the Windows messages are intercepted.

## Remarks


### Calling the same event several times on the same object 
<a name="calling_the_same_event_several_times_the_same_object_ELTPARAGRAPHE000074"></a>

**Event** can be used to manage the same event several times for the same element (control, window, etc.).

In this case, the events are "stacked":

- the first event is managed until the next event is called.

- when an event is not managed anymore ([EndEvent](../WDLang1/3015010.md)), the event found immediately before it (if it exists) is taken into account.

### Procedure called by Event
<a name="procedure_called_docparampagetitleshort_ELTPARAGRAPHE000091"></a>

The interception procedure called by **Event** must have the following format:

```txt
FUNCTION ProcedureManageEvent(WindowsMessage, wParam, IParam)
```
WindowsMessage, wParam and lParam are three optional integers, used to send and to receive information about the message and the relevant objects.
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Parameters used by the procedure
<a name="parameters_used_the_procedure_ELTPARAGRAPHE000104"></a>

The interception procedure called by **Event** can use the following variables:

| Variables | Meaning | 5.5 variable kept for backward compatibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **MySelf..Name** | Name of the object (control, group of controls or window)<br>Read-only variable | _EVE.name |
| **Message** | Number of the message (first parameter of the procedure)<br>Read-only variable | _EVE.wMessage |
| **wParam** | First parameter of the message (second parameter of the procedure)<br>Read-only variable | _EVE.wParam |
| **lParam** | Second parameter of the message (third parameter of the procedure)<br>Read-only variable | _EVE.lParam |
| **Handle("")** | Handle of the object that received the message<br>Read-only variable | _EVE.hWnd |
| **Value returned by the procedure** | Returns a value to Windows | _EVE.Return |



**Remark**: If the process returns a value (an integer), the Windows event is stopped: this value is returned. If the process returns NO value, the execution continues.

### Events used by WINDEV
<a name="events_used_windev_ELTPARAGRAPHE000170"></a>

WINDEV uses the events included between "WM_USER + 700" and "WM_USER + 1200". Therefore, other ranges of events must be used ("WM_USER + 1300" to "WM_USER + 1400" for example).
