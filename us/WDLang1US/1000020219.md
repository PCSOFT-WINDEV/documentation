## Remarks


- All rows added by [&lt;Multiline Zone&gt;.AddLine](../WDLang1/1000020216.md) and [&lt;Multiline Zone&gt;.InsertLine](../WDLang1/1000020217.md) are deleted.

- The static rows defined in the window editor are not impacted.

- The size of the Multiline Zone control is modified to take the deleted rows into account: the control is reduced from the bottom. If controls are located below the Multiline Zone control, they are moved to the top. The useful window height is reduced accordingly.
