The **Control** type is used to define the characteristics of a control. This control can be dynamically created by [ControlCreate](../WDLang1/1000020876.md) or it can be a control found in a window or in a report. 

![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) [ControlCreate](../WDLang1/1000020876.md) is not available.

**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

## Example

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) 
```wl
// Dynamically create a control in a window
c is Control
c <- ControlCreate("BUTTON_1", typBouton, 30, 40, 140, 20) // Caution, not '='

c.Caption = "Click here"

c.Process[trtClick] = myProcedure
```

### Declaring a Control variable
<a name="declaring_control_variable_ELTPARAGRAPHE000052"></a>

The following syntax is used to declare a Control variable: 


```txt
<Variable Name> is Control
```

<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Assigning a Control variable
<a name="assigning_control_variable_ELTPARAGRAPHE000061"></a>

A **Control** variable can be used to handle: 

- a control found in a window or in a report. 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) a control created by [ControlCreate](../WDLang1/1000020876.md). 




The assignment of a Control variable must be performed by the '<-' operator. 

Examples: 


```wl
// Assignment with an existing control
c is Control
c <- EDT_Edit1
```



```wl
// Assignment by using the indirection
// The variable references the EDT_EDIT2 control
c <- {"EDT_EDIT2"}
```


![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) 
```wl
// Assignment with a control created by ControlCreate
c is Control
c <- ControlCreate("BUTTON_1", typButton, 30, 40, 140, 20)
```


**Caution**: The '=' operator must not be used to assign a **Control** variable. This operator is used to transfer the value of a control into another control of the same type. For example: 


```wl
// Assignment with an existing control
c is Control
c <- EDT_Edit1


// Modify the value 
c = EDT_Edit3 // Equivalent code: EDT_Edit1.Value = EDT_Edit3.Value

c = "Text" // Equivalent code: EDT_Edit1.Value = "Text"
```


**Remark**: To know if a value has been assigned to the Control variable, use the [Type](../Proprietes/2510131.md) property on the variable.

### Using a Control variable in a procedure
<a name="using_control_variable_procedure_ELTPARAGRAPHE000100"></a>

The **Control** type can be a parameter of a procedure. You can write for example: 

- the code of the procedure: 
	
	```wl
	PROCEDURE MyProcedure(C is Control)
	C = "It is " + TimeSys()
	```


- the call to the procedure: 
	
	```wl
	MyProcedure(EDT_Edit1)
	```

### Optimizing the processes with indirection
<a name="optimizing_the_processes_with_indirection_ELTPARAGRAPHE000114"></a>

The **Control** type can be used to optimize the processes that use the indirections. You can write for example: 


```wl
C is Control <-{s, indControl}
C.Width = 10
C.Height = 20
```


rather than the following code: 


```wl
{s, indControl}..Width = 10
{s, indControl}..Height = 20
```





<a name="NOTE0_5"></a>


### Properties associated with a Control variable
<a name="properties_associated_with_control_variable_ELTPARAGRAPHE000128"></a>

The **Control** type is used to handle all types of controls found in a window or in a report. The available properties depend on the type of control used. 

Therefore, if a Control variable is used to handle an edit control, all the WLanguage properties available for the edit control will be usable on the **Control** variable. To get the properties of a control, see the control help page: the "See Also" link is used to access all the control properties. For more details, see [Window controls](../WDChamp/1013081.md). 
<a name="NOTE0_6"></a>


### Functions that handle a Control variable
<a name="functions_that_handle_control_variable_ELTPARAGRAPHE000142"></a>

All the WLanguage functions that handle the controls can be used on a **Control** variable. However, only the WLanguage functions corresponding to the type of control used will be available. 

Therefore, the TableXXX functions can be used on a Control variable that handles a Table control.
