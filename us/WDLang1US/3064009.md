## Remarks


### Loading an external component
<a name="loading_external_component_ELTPARAGRAPHE000060"></a>

The load mode of the external component (when starting the project or during the first use of a component element) is defined when the external component is included in the project.

To change the loading mode:

1. In the "Project explorer" pane: 

	- select the "External components" folder. 

	- right-click to open the folder context menu

	- select "List of external components imported into the project".




2. In the window that appears, select the desired external component and click "Description".

3. Modify the load mode ("Load mode of component").




**Reminder**: The following events are executed when an external component is loaded:

- declaration event of the classes of the component.

- declaration event of the sets of procedures of the component.

- initialization event of the component.

### Finding the external component to load
<a name="finding_the_external_component_load_ELTPARAGRAPHE000083"></a>

When loading the external component, the external component will be sought:

- first, in the directory specified in the &lt;Component directory&gt; of [ComponentLoad](../WDLang1/3014023.md).

- then, in the directory specified in &lt;Component directory&gt; of **ComponentLocate**.

- then, in the directory specified in "&lt;Component name&gt;.INI". For more details on this file, see [Deploying an application that uses an external component](../Editeurs/2014004.md).

- finally, in the EXE directory of the project.
