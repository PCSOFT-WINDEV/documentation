Throw a non-fatal error. This error can be processed by the calling code if the management of non-fatal errors was enabled for this code (by the [error handling window](../WDLang1/3034010.md) or the [ErrorChangeParameter](../WDLang1/3034009.md) function).

## Remarks




### Special case
<a name="special_case_ELTPARAGRAPHE000072"></a>

The mechanism for processing the error, regardless whether it is managed automatically (by [error handling window](../WDLang1/3034010.md)) or through programming (with [ErrorChangeParameter](../WDLang1/3034009.md)), is not triggered if the WLanguage function or the user procedure is found in one of the following cases:


```txt
IF NOT <Function or procedure> THEN
	// Process the error
END
```



```txt
<Function or procedure>
IF ErrorOccurred = True THEN
	// Process the error
END
```


The mechanism considers that the error is processed by programming and the automatic process is not triggered.
