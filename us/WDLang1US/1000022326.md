The serialization constants are as follows:

| Constant | Description | Function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **psdBinary** | Binary serialization. | [Deserialize](../WDLang1/3013066.md)<br>[Serialize](../WDLang1/3013065.md) |
| **psdBinaryFormat16** | Binary serialization in 16-compatible format. | [Deserialize](../WDLang1/3013066.md)<br>[Serialize](../WDLang1/3013065.md) |
| **psdJSON** | JSON serialization. | [Deserialize](../WDLang1/3013066.md)<br>[Serialize](../WDLang1/3013065.md) |
| **psdFormatting** | JSON serialization with new lines and indentation. | [Serialize](../WDLang1/3013065.md)<br>[VariantToJSON](../WDLang1/1000021051.md) |
| **psdXML** | XML serialization with reference to sub-objects. This type of serialization allows you to use the XML format as storage and exchange modes between applications written in WLanguage. | [Deserialize](../WDLang1/3013066.md)<br>[Serialize](../WDLang1/3013065.md) |
| **psdXML_FormerFormat** | Up to version 100050, the use of the psdXML constant did not generate a valid XML file. The generated format caused problems on Mobile devices. This problem was fixed.<br><br>An XML file created with a version later than version 100050 cannot be read by a program compiled with an earlier version. To keep the operating mode of version 100050, use the psdXML_FormerFormat constant. | [Deserialize](../WDLang1/3013066.md)<br>[Serialize](../WDLang1/3013065.md) |
| **psdXMLAggregated** | XML serialization with direct aggregation of sub-objects. This type of serialization allows you to easily generate an XML file in a standard format to perform exchanges with other systems. | [Deserialize](../WDLang1/3013066.md)<br>[Serialize](../WDLang1/3013065.md) |
