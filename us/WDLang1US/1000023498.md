The **psheetSelection** type is used to find out the advanced characteristics of a selection in a Spreadsheet control. The characteristics of this selection are returned by several WLanguage properties. 

The [.Selection](../Proprietes/1000023033.md) property gets a variable of type **psheetSelection**. 

**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

## Example


```wl
sel is psheetSelection = PSHEET_MySpreadsheet.Selection
IF sel.Type = psheetSelSimpleCell THEN
	// Display the cell name in the status bar
	STATUSBAR = sel.MinCell
END
```



```wl
t is psheetSelection
t = PSHEET_NoName1.Selection
SWITCH t.Type
	CASE psheetSelSimpleCell: Trace("You have selected only one cell.")
	CASE psheetSelSimpleHeader: Trace("You have selected only one header.")
	CASE psheetSelMultiCell: Trace("You have selected several cells.")
	CASE psheetSelMultiHeader: Trace("You have selected several headers.")	
	CASE psheetSelRectCell: Trace("You have selected several cells (rectangle).")
	CASE psheetSelEmpty: Trace("You haven't selected any cells.")
	CASE psheetSelAll: Trace ("You have selected the entire worksheet.")	
	OTHER CASE	
END

te is array of strings = t.Header
tc is array of strings = t.Cell
Trc is array of strings = t.RectCell

### Properties specific to the description of psheetSelection variables
<a name="properties_specific_the_description_psheetselection_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000035"></a>

The following properties can be used to handle a selection in a Spreadsheet control:

| Property name | Type used | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cell | Array of strings | Array of selected cells. The cells are sorted according to the selection order. <br><br>**This property is read-only**. |
| Header | Array of strings | Selected headers (headers of selected rows and/or columns). <br><br>**This property is read-only**. |
| MaxCell | Character string | Maximum selected cell, which means the cell found at the bottom right of the rectangle defining the selection of cells.  <br><br>**This property is read-only**. |
| MinCell | Character string | Minimum selected cell, which means the cell found at the top left of the rectangle defining the selection of cells.  <br><br>**This property is read-only**. |
| RectCell | Array of strings | Array of rectangles of selected cells. Example: "A1:B2" <br><br>**This property is read-only**. |
| Type | Integer constant | Type of selection: <br><br>- *psheetSelMultiCell*: Several cells are selected. <br><br>- *psheetSelMultiHeader*: Several headers are selected. <br><br>- *psheetSelRectCell*: Several cells are selected and they define a rectangle. <br><br>- *psheetSelSimpleCell*: A single cell is selected. <br><br>- *psheetSelSimpleHeader*: A single header is selected. <br><br>- *psheetSelAll*: The entire worksheet is selected.<br><br>- *psheetSelEmpty*: No selection.<br><br><br>**This property is read-only**. |
