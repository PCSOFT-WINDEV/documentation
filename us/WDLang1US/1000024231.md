Draws a point in an Image control.



![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) **Caution**: A specific configuration is required to use this function in Linux. For more details, see [The drawings](../WDLang1/3029035.md).

## Example


```wl
// Draw a light yellow point in an Image control
IMG_Drawing.DrawPoint(10, 50, LightYellow)
```

## Syntax

### Drawing a point by specifying its coordinates 

`<Image variable>.DrawPoint(<X-coordinate> , <Y-coordinate> [, <Point color> [, <Opacity>]])`
---

**`<Image variable>: (Image variable)`**

Name of the Image control to be used.

**`<X-coordinate>: (Integer)`**

Horizontal position (in pixels) of the point to draw.

**`<Y-coordinate>: (Integer)`**

Vertical position (in pixels) of the point to draw.

**`<Point color>: (Integer or constant (optional))`**

Color that must be assigned to the point. This color can correspond to:

- an RGB color (returned by [RGB](../WDLang1/3029012.md)),

- an HSL color (returned by [HSL](../WDLang1/3029057.md)),

- [a WLanguage preset color](../WDLang5/3010002.md).




If this parameter is not specified, the color of the point:

- is *Transparent* if [&lt;Image&gt;.Pen](../WDLang1/1000024016.md) has not been used beforehand, 

- corresponds to the color specified in the last call to [&lt;Image&gt;.Pen](../WDLang1/1000024016.md).




**`<Opacity>: (Optional integer)`**

Opacity of color, included between 0 (transparent) and 255 (opaque). An opacity sets to 128 indicates that the relevant pixel will have a transparency of 50% when it is drawn on the screen or saved in an image in PNG format. 

**Remark**: This opacity will be taken into account if the drawing found in the image was initialized by the *dWithOpacity* constant ([&lt;Image&gt;.StartDrawing](../WDLang1/1000024326.md)).

### Drawing a point via a Point variable 

`<Image variable>.DrawPoint(<Point> [, <Point color> [, <Opacity>]])`
---

**`<Image variable>: (Image variable)`**

Name of the Image control to be used.

**`<Point>: (Point variable)`**

Name of the [Point](../Motscles/1000018908.md) variable containing the coordinates of the point to draw.

**`<Point color>: (Integer or constant (optional))`**

Color that must be assigned to the point. This color can correspond to:

- an RGB color (returned by [RGB](../WDLang1/3029012.md)),

- an HSL color (returned by [HSL](../WDLang1/3029057.md)),

- [a WLanguage preset color](../WDLang5/3010002.md).




If this parameter is not specified, the color of the point:

- is *Transparent* if [&lt;Image&gt;.Pen](../WDLang1/1000024016.md) has not been used beforehand, 

- corresponds to the color specified in the last call to [&lt;Image&gt;.Pen](../WDLang1/1000024016.md).




**`<Opacity>: (Optional integer)`**

Opacity of color, included between 0 (transparent) and 255 (opaque). An opacity sets to 128 indicates that the relevant pixel will have a transparency of 50% when it is drawn on the screen or saved in an image in PNG format. 

**Remark**: This opacity will be taken into account if the drawing found in the image was initialized by the *dWithOpacity* constant ([&lt;Image&gt;.StartDrawing](../WDLang1/1000024326.md)).
