## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000118"></a>
The security mechanism of WLanguage is enabled when a programming error occurs in an application or in a site. An error message is displayed on the end-user computer and the execution of the program is ended.

**To reduce the impact of programming errors**, WINDEV, WINDEV Mobile and WEBDEV include different solutions:

- The display of a custom error message. 
	![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This option is not available.

- The mechanism of exceptions. This allows you to customize the management of the error.




**Caution**: These solutions can only be used to manage the programming errors. These solutions cannot be used to manage the runtime errors (such as "unable to write into a read-only file"). To manage the runtime errors, see [Automatic management of errors.](../WDLang1/3034010.md)

## Displaying a custom message
<a name="displaying_custom_message_ELTTEXTE000142"></a>
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png) To display a custom message when a programming error occurs, all you have to do is enter the text of the error when creating the executable.

This enables you to display (without programming) a message such as:

*"Problem in the XXX application: Write down the error message and contact our technical support at xx.xx.xx.xx.xx".*

## Exception mechanism
<a name="exception_mechanism_ELTTEXTE000166"></a>
The exception mechanism is used to process the error cases through programming. If an exception process is triggered, no error message is displayed and the code of the exception is run. This code allows you to perform all the necessary operations:

- to exit from the current application "properly" if the error is a fatal error, 

- to give control back to the user if the error can be corrected.




**WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile propose several types of exception processes:**

- [The automated exceptions](../WDLang1/3034013.md): the management of the exceptions is implemented in the interface of WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile.

- [The general exceptions](../WDLang1/3034001.md): the exception process is valid for the entire object (project, window, page, report, ...).

- [The specific exceptions](../WDLang1/3034003.md): the exception process is valid for a specified section of code.





- ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Dynamiccompilation.gif) ***Unit examples (WINDEV)*** : **Dynamic compilation** <br>Dynamic compilation of WLanguage code (stored in string format), execution of the dynamically generated procedure and process of possible runtime errors.<br>The dynamic compilation is very useful when mathematical calculations are proposed to the end user for example.
