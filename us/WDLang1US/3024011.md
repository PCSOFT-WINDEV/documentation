<a name="description"></a>
Compares two strings character by character:

- according to the sequence of ASCII characters.

- according to the alphabetical order.





<a name="Example1"></a>
<a name="sample_code"></a>

## Example


```wl
MyString1 is string = "Developing is fantastic"
MyString2 is string = "Developing is simple"
ResultCompare is int = StringCompare(MyString1, MyString2)
// ResultCompare = -1: the character 'f' comes before the character 's'
```

<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

## Syntax

`<Result> = StringCompare(<First string> , <Second string> [, <Options>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**



- 0 if the character strings are equal.

- -1 if the characters in &lt;First string&gt; come before the characters in &lt;Second string&gt; according to the ASCII order or to the lexicographic order.

- 1 if the characters in &lt;First string&gt; come after the characters in &lt;Second string&gt; according to the ASCII order or to the lexicographic order.




**`<First string>: (Character string)`**

Character string to compare.

**`<Second string>: (Character string)`**

Character string to compare.

**`<Options>: (Optional constant (or combination of constants))`**

Comparison options:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *ccIgnoreAccent* | Compares strings ignoring accented characters.<br><br> |
| *ccIgnoreCase* | Compares strings ignoring the case (uppercase/lowercase characters). |
| *ccIgnoreInsideSpace* | Compares strings ignoring spaces within the strings.<br><br>![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This constant is not available. |
| *ccIgnorePunctuationAndSpace* | Compares strings ignoring punctuation and spaces (see Notes for more details).<br><br> |
| *ccIgnoreSpace* | Compares strings ignoring spaces before and after the strings. |
| *ccLexicographicOrder* | Compares strings in lexicographical order (for example, 'é' is between 'e' and 'f'). <br><br> |
| *ccNormal*<br>(default value) | Standard comparison, similar to the '=' operator. |
| *ccRespectNumeric* | Compares strings taking into account the numeric values within the strings (in this case, "10" comes after "9"). |

## Remarks




### Equivalence between StringCompare and comparison operators
<a name="equivalence_between_docparampagetitleshort_and_comparison_operators_ELTPARAGRAPHE000128"></a>

- **= operator**: 
	The = operator is equivalent to the following code: StringCompare(&lt;String1&gt;, &lt;String2&gt;, ccNormal)

- **~= operator**: 
	The ~= operator is equivalent to the following code: StringCompare(&lt;String1&gt;, &lt;String2&gt;, ccIgnoreCasse, + ccIgnoreAccent + ccIgnoreSpace)
	

- **~~ operator**: 
	The ~~ operator is equivalent to the following code: StringCompare(&lt;String1&gt;, &lt;String2&gt;, ccIgnoreCasse + ccIgnoreAccent + ccIgnorePonctuationAndSpace)
	

- **&lt;, &gt;, &lt;= and &gt;= operators**: 
	These operators are equivalent to the following code: StringCompare(&lt;String1&gt;, &lt;String2&gt;, ccLexicographicOrder)

### Comparing numeric values
<a name="comparing_numeric_values_ELTPARAGRAPHE000167"></a>

The *ccRespectNumeric* constant sorts by taking into account the numeric value represented by digits and not just the alphabetical order of the numbers.

Without the *ccRespectNumeric* constant, the strings below will be sorted in the following order: "string1", "string10", "string2"

With the *ccRespectNumeric* constant, the same strings will be sorted in this order: "string1", "string2", "string10"

Examples of comparison performed with and without the ***ccRespectNumeric*** constant:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| Sorting strings containing digits without the *ccRespectNumeric* constant | Sorting strings containing digits with the *ccRespectNumeric* constant |
| 0 | 00 |
| 00 | 0 |
| 001 | 001 |
| 009 | 01 |
| 01 | 1 |
| 010 | 009 |
| 09 | 09 |
| 1 | 9 |
| 10 | 010 |
| 11 | 10 |
| 9 | 11 |






|   |   |
| --- | --- |

| 10.01Gh | 7.01Ba |

### Characters taken into account for punctuation and spaces
<a name="characters_taken_into_account_for_punctuation_and_spaces_ELTPARAGRAPHE000442"></a>The characters taken into account for punctuation and spaces are provided by the system. To get the list of these characters, write the following WLanguage code:

```wl
s is string
FOR i = 0 TO 255
	IF Charact(i) <> StringFormat(Charact(i), ccIgnorePunctuationAndSpace) THEN
		 s += Charact(i)
	END
END

### StringCompare and UNICODE
<a name="docparampagetitleshort_and_unicode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000306"></a>

You have the ability to use ANSI strings, Unicode strings and buffers in the different parameters of the function.

The following conversion rule is used for the Ansi systems (Windows or Linux):

- If at least one of the strings is a buffer, all the strings are converted to buffers and the operation is performed with buffers.

- If the first condition is not met and there is at least one Unicode string, all the strings are converted to Unicode and the operation is performed in Unicode (the conversion is performed with the current character set, if necessary).

- Otherwise, the operation is performed in Ansi.




The conversion rule used for Unicode systems is as follows:

- If at least one of the strings is a buffer, all the strings are converted to buffers and the operation is performed with buffers.

- Otherwise, the operation is performed in Unicode.




For more details on UNICODE, see [Managing UNICODE](../WDLang1/3024038.md).

Reminder: The linguistic parameters used are defined during the call to [ChangeCharset](../WDLang1/3054001.md).
