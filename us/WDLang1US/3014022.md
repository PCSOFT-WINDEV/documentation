Used to find out and signal the possible errors via an assertive programming. **dbgAssert** is used in a code where a possible error may occur. A window signals the problem if an error occurs.

This mode is used by default in test mode and it can be enabled at runtime by [dbgEnableAssert](../WDLang1/3014021.md).

## Example


```wl
// The procedure named FindCustomer(Number) is used to find the specified customer
PROCEDURE FindCustomer(Number)
HReadSeekFirst(Customer, Number, Number)
dbgAssert(HFound, "Customer not found")
```


<a name="Example2"></a>



```wl
// SoughtValue was passed as parameter, it should exist in the data file. 
// Position on the record
HReadSeekFirst(FileName, ItemName, SoughtValue)
// Check whether a record was found 
// (in all cases, "standard" or "debug" mode)
IF HFound(FileName) = False THEN
	// In "debug" mode, display a message to indicate that a problem occurred
	dbgAssert(False, StringBuild("The %1 record of" + ...
				"FileName was not found", SoughtValue))
	// Manage this case in the code by creating a record if it was not found
	HReset(FileName)
	FileName.ItemName = SoughtValue
	HAdd(FileName)
END

## Syntax

`dbgAssert(<Condition to check> [, <Comment>])`
---

**`<Condition to check>: (Character string)`**

Condition whose test must be run. This condition can be a WLanguage function, a local or global procedure, an expression, ...

**`<Comment>: (Optional character string)`**

Text that will be displayed (in a window) if the condition is not checked.

## Remarks


- In test mode, the management of assertions is enabled by default.

- At runtime, the management of assertions is disabled by default. **dbgAssert** is not run. The WLanguage function specified in parameter will not be run.

- There is no need to use [InTestMode](../WDLang1/3013011.md) when the management of assertions is enabled. This function was commonly used to monitor a specific operating mode that can now be done with **dbgAssert**.
