## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

### Saving the modifications in a buffer

`<Result> = WinEdSave(<Window> , <inMemory> , <Save mode>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Buffer)`**

Buffer containing the result of the backup. The buffer is empty if no modification was performed.

**`<Window>: (Window name)`**

Name of window or internal window to use.

**`<inMemory>: (Constant)`**

*inMemory*: Constant used to save the modifications in memory.

**`<Save mode>: (Integer constant)`**

Mode for saving the modifications: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *weModeDifferential*<br>(Default value) | Save all the modification operations, including custom operations ([WinEdDo](../WDLang1/1000021897.md)). All these operations will be replayed during the reload operation (like for a log). |
| *weModeFull* | Save changes for all controls and their current properties. This constant can be used on an internal window only.  |
| *weModeReposionableNote* | Save only repositionable notes created by the user. This constant is equivalent to the "Export the notes" feature in the context menu of repositionable notes (AAF). |




<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Saving the modifications in a file

`<Result> = WinEdSave(<Window> , <File name> , <Save mode>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the modifications have been saved, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> if an error occurred. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md).


Remark: If no modification was performed, &lt;Result&gt; is set to <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>. 

**`<Window>: (Window name)`**

Name of window or internal window to use. 

**`<File name>: (Character string)`**

Name of the file in which the modifications must be saved. The extension of this file is "wdmodif". 

**`<Save mode>: (Integer constant)`**

Mode for saving the modifications:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *weModeDifferential*<br>(Default value) | Save all the modification operations, including custom operations ([WinEdDo](../WDLang1/1000021897.md)). All these operations will be replayed during the reload operation (like for a log). |
| *weModeFull* | Save changes for all controls and their current properties. This constant can be used on an internal window only.  |
| *weModeReposionableNote* | Save only repositionable notes created by the user. This constant is equivalent to the "Export the notes" feature in the context menu of repositionable notes (AAF).<br><br>You can also use [WinEdSaveNote](../WDLang1/1000022120.md) to save only the repositionable notes created by the user. |
