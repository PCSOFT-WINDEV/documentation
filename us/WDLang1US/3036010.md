## Remarks


### Identifying the files attributes
<a name="identifying_the_files_attributes_ELTPARAGRAPHE000171"></a>

To retrieve the different attributes of a file, check whether one of the letters identifying an attribute is found in &lt;Result&gt;. This search can be performed by [Position](../WDLang1/3024027.md) for example.
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![User code (UMC)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/MCU.png) 

### Modifying the attributes of a file (syntax 2)
<a name="modifying_the_attributes_file_syntax_2_ELTPARAGRAPHE000183"></a>

Once modified, the attributes of the file correspond to the attributes specified with **fAttribute**. For example, if &lt;File attributes&gt; corresponds to "AR", the specified file will become a read-only archive file.

Special cases:

- Modifying a directory or a subdirectory: the "Directory or subdirectory" attribute (letter D) cannot be modified. Regardless of the modification performed, the directory (or the subdirectory) will keep the "Directory and subdirectory" attribute (letter D).

- Modifying a compressed file (on the NTFS partitions): the "Compressed file" attribute (letter C) cannot be modified. Regardless of the modification performed, the compressed file will keep the "Compressed file" attribute (letter C).

### Handling errors
<a name="handling_errors_ELTPARAGRAPHE000197"></a>

**fAttribute** throws an error in the following cases:

- the specified file does not exist,

- the name of the specified file is invalid,

- the specified file is opened or locked by another application (when modifying the attributes only), 

- the letters specified in &lt;File attributes&gt; do not correspond to file attributes.

### Operating mode in Windows Vista (and later)
<a name="operating_mode_windows_vista_and_later_ELTPARAGRAPHE000215"></a>

If this function does not operate properly in Windows Vista (and later), check whether the file or directory used is not in one of the system directories (Windows directory or "Program Files" directory).

**In Windows Vista (and later), with the [UAC mechanism](../Editeurs/2025014.md) (User Account Control) enabled**, you must have administrator privileges to handle and/or modify the files or directories in system directories (Windows directory or "Program Files" directory).

**Programming tip**: To handle and/or modify the files or directories without administrator privileges, you should:

- avoid writing to the Windows directory or to the "Program Files" directory, 

- use the system directory of the application (returned by [SysDir](../WDLang1/3073026.md) with the *srAppDataCommun* constant, for example).
