## Overview

For a multilingual application, you have the ability to: 

- define the languages supported in the project description (for more details, see [Project description: Languages tab](../Editeurs/9500219.md)).

- type in the different project languages all elements that must be translated: captions of controls, messages in the code, ...




A multilingual information can be typed: 

- in the description window of element (control, window, report, page, ...).

- when editing the control caption: all you have to do is switch to edit (via the Space key) and press Ctrl + T. The window for typing the different languages is displayed:

Each language defined in the project is identified by its flag, its name and its number. All you have to do is type the translation in the requested language. A specific menu (displayed via ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Projet_multilangue%20-%20HC%20N%B0003%201.gif)
) is used to simplify the translation operations.

The menu for entering translations proposes the following features:

- **Clipboard**

	- Copy from: 

		- Language currently in edit: Copies the current text into the clipboard.

		- All the languages: Copies the text found in all the languages into the clipboard. The multilingual text can be pasted into another element via the "Paste into" menu option: each language of the copied message will be pasted in the corresponding language of the element.

		- Advanced: Opens a window used to select the languages that will be copied into the clipboard. When validating this window, the texts of the selected languages are copied into the clipboard. The multilingual text can be pasted into another element via the "Paste into" menu option: each language of the copied message will be pasted in the corresponding language of the element.




- Paste in: 

	- Language currently in edit: Pastes the clipboard message to the current text.

	- All the languages: Pastes the clipboard text in all the languages to the current multilingual text. This text must have been copied from another multilingual element via the "Copy into" menu option: each language of the copied message is pasted in the corresponding language of the element.

	- Advanced: Opens a window used to select the languages that will be pasted from the clipboard. When validating this window, the texts of selected languages are pasted in the current multilingual text. This text must have been copied from another multilingual element via the "Copy into" menu option: each language of the copied message is pasted in the corresponding language of the element.

- **Apply**

	- Apply the language currently in edit -> all the languages: Applies the current text to all the other languages. This option is useful to avoid having empty texts in the non-translated languages.

	- Apply automatically (language currently in edit): Automatically applies the text entered in the current language to all the other languages. In this case, the texts can no longer be entered in the other languages. This option is useful to avoid having empty texts in the non-translated languages.

	- Options for automatic apply: Opens a window used to choose:

		- for all the projects: if the messages of the selected language are automatically applied to all the other languages for all the projects.

		- for the current project, if the apply of language is the same for all the projects or if the selected language is automatically applied to all the other languages in this project only.




- **Translations**

	- Translate -> currently in edit: Translates the text from the selected language to the language currently in edit.

	- Translate all languages: Translates the text from the reference language to the other languages.

	- Configure translation engine: Opens the window for configuring the translation engine. For more details, see [Translation options in the editors](../Editeurs/2036001.md).




- **Other actions**

	- Go to next language: Positions the input cursor on the text of the next language.

	- Restore the value:

		- Language currently in edit: Restores the current text as it was when opening the window for entering the multilingual text.

		- All the languages: Restores the text in all the languages as it was when opening the window for entering the multilingual text.
