Starts "collecting data" for the [performance profiler](../Editeurs/2030035.md).

**Reminder**: To start the performance profiler, press: Shift + Windows + F10. 

Once this function is called, all the executed processes/events are saved in a WPF file.

This file can be opened:

- by the [performance profiler](../Editeurs/2030035.md). 

- in the editor of WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile: on the "Home" tab, in the "General" group, expand "Open" and select "Open".

## Syntax

`ProfilerStart([<Name of WPF file>])`
---

**`<Name of WPF file>: (Optional character string)`**

Location and name of the WPF file to create. The name of the WPF file can be built from the following elements:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [%ExeDir%] | Directory of the executable, always filled with the "\\" character. This directory is equivalent to the result of [fExeDir](../WDLang1/3036049.md). |
| [%ExeName%] | Name of the executable. |
| [%Date%] | Start date for collecting information (YYYYMMDD format). |
| [%Time%] | Start time for collecting information (HHMMSS format) |
| [%UserName%] | Name of the current user. |
| [%ComputerName%] | Name of the computer. |
| [%DataDir%] | Directory of the HFSQL data files specified by the user when installing the application. This directory is equivalent to the result of [fDataDir](../WDLang1/3036001.md). |
| [%DirUserData%] | Directory for the data of the current user of the current application. This directory is equivalent to the result of [fDataDirUser](../WDLang1/3036071.md). |

By default: 

- the extension of the WPF file is ".wpf". 

- the name of the WPF file corresponds to: "[%UserDataDir%][%ExeName%]_[%Date%]_[%Time%]". 
	For example: "C:\\Users\\Doc\\AppData\\Roaming\\WINDEV applications\\MyApp\\MyApp_20161023_130812.wpf".




Caution: If you use the dynamic string construction ("Allow "[% %]" in the strings" in the "Compilation" tab of the project description), a compilation error occurs (unknown identifier). In this case, each string must be preceded by '-%'. Example: 

```wl
ProfilerStart("[%DirUserData%][%ExeName%]_[%Date%]_[%Time%]")
```
 becomes
```wl
ProfilerStart(-%"[%DirUserData%][%ExeName%]_[%Date%]_[%Time%]")
```

## Remarks
A WLanguage error occurs if **ProfilerStart** is used multiple times in the same process or event (without calling [ProfilerEnd](../WDLang1/3013002.md)).
