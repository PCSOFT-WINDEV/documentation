## Example


```wl
// Forces the telemetry data to be sent every half hour
TelemetryConfigure(tcMaximumPeriodCollection, 1800)
```

### Finding out the telemetry parameters

`<Result> = TelemetryConfigure(<Parameter>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**

Value of specified parameter. 

**`<Parameter>: (Integer constant)`**

Parameter to retrieve. This parameter corresponds to one of the following constants: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *tcEnableLog* | Configure the telemetry log. Can correspond to a combination of the following constants: <br><br>- *tcFileLog*: The telemetry uses a file log. The corresponding file is saved in the "&lt;user&gt;\\AppData\\Roaming\\&lt;company&gt;\\&lt;application&gt;" directory. <br>	<br><br>- *tcMemoryLog*: The telemetry uses a memory log. <br><br><br> |
| *tcGetMemoryLog* | Returns the content of memory log. |
| *tcIdleTimeout* | Used to count the activity time on a window: the count stopwatch is automatically stopped after this idle time. <br>This timeout is set to 1 minute by default. |
| *tcMaximumPeriodCollection* | Maximum periodicity for collecting the telemetry data (in seconds). The data will be sent at the end of this period, regardless of the size of collected data. <br>This period is set to 1 hour by default. |
| *tcMinimumPeriodCollection* | Minimum periodicity for collecting the telemetry data (in seconds). The data can be sent at the end of this period if the minimum size is reached. <br>This period is set to 5 minutes by default. |
| *tcMinimumSizeCollection* | Minimum size of data collected for the minimum collection period (in kilobytes). <br>This size is set to 5 MB by default. |
| *tcNumberSendAttempts* | Maximum number of attempts to send telemetry data in online mode: <br><br>- 0. Attempts are not counted. Data is sent every time, even if the server does not respond. <br><br>- 1. Data is sent only once when the application is started. If the server does not respond, there will be no more attempts. <br><br>- other value (3 by default). Allows you to set a total number of attempts within a given period to send data. <br><br><br><br><br>By default, tcNumberSendAttempts = 3 and tcMaximumPeriodCollection = 1 so there are 3 hours of attempts. |
| *tcOfflineMode* | Operating mode of telemetry: <br><br>- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> (default value). Telemetry works in offline mode. <br><br>- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>. Telemetry works in online mode (default behavior before version 25).. <br><br><br><br><br>For more details on how telemetry works, see [Telemetry: Method used to send data](../WDLang1/1410086649.md). |
| *tcStatus* | Current status of telemetry. This status can correspond to one of the following constants: <br><br>- *tsAbandon*: the telemetry is abandoned after too many send errors. <br><br>- *tsCollect*: the telemetry is enabled and a collection is in progress. <br><br>- *tsSend*: the telemetry is enabled and information was sent. <br><br>- *tsError*: the telemetry is enabled but no information was sent to the server. <br><br>- *tsInactive*: the telemetry is inactive.<br><br><br> |

### Modifying the telemetry parameters

`<Result> = TelemetryConfigure(<Parameter> , <New value>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**

Former value of specified parameter.

**`<Parameter>: (Integer constant)`**

Parameter to modify. This parameter corresponds to one of the following constants: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *tcEnableLog* | Configure the telemetry log. Can correspond to a combination of the following constants: <br><br>- *tcFileLog*: The telemetry uses a file log. The corresponding file is saved in the "&lt;user&gt;\\AppData\\Roaming\\&lt;company&gt;\\&lt;application&gt;" directory. <br><br>- *tcMemoryLog*: The telemetry uses a memory log. <br><br><br> |
| *tcIdleTimeout* | Used to count the activity time on a window: the count stopwatch is automatically stopped after this idle time. This timeout is set to 1 minute by default. |
| *tcMaximumPeriodCollection* | Maximum periodicity for collecting the telemetry data (in seconds). The data will be sent at the end of this period, regardless of the size of collected data. This period is set to 1 hour by default. |
| *tcMinimumPeriodCollection* | Minimum periodicity for collecting the telemetry data (in seconds). The data can be sent at the end of this period if the minimum size is reached. This period is set to 5 minutes by default. |
| *tcMinimumSizeCollection* | Minimum size of data collected for the minimum collection period (in kilobytes). This size is set to 5 MB by default. |
| *tcNumberSendAttempts* | Maximum number of attempts to send telemetry data in online mode: <br><br>- 0. Attempts are not counted. Data is sent every time, even if the server does not respond. <br><br>- 1. Data is sent only once when the application is started. If the server does not respond, there will be no more attempts. <br><br>- other value (3 by default).

| *tcOfflineMode* | Operating mode of telemetry: <br><br>- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> (default value). Telemetry works in offline mode. <br><br>- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>. Telemetry works in online mode (default behavior before version 25).. <br><br><br><br><br>For more details on how telemetry works, see [Telemetry: Method used to send data](../WDLang1/1410086649.md). |



**`<New value>: (Integer)`**

New value for the parameter.

## Remarks
**TelemetryConfigure** can be called before [TelemetryEnable](../WDLang1/1000021900.md). 

If **TelemetryConfigure** is called after [TelemetryEnable](../WDLang1/1000021900.md), the new parameters will be taken into account after a timeout not corresponding to the previous minimum collection time.
