Modifies the management modes of threads. The available management modes are as follows:

- the automatic or manual management of the critical sections on the procedures and on the methods.

- the distribution of the execution of the threads on the different processors or on the different cores of the computer.




The automatic critical sections prevent the execution of a procedure or method by several threads simultaneously. The automatic critical sections are enabled by default.
![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png)![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) **ThreadMode** has no effect: the management mode is always multi-processor, with manual management of critical sections.

## Syntax

### Modifying the management modes of threads

`<Result> = ThreadMode(<New management modes>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**

Management modes of threads before the modification, combination of the constants below.

**`<New management modes>: (Constant or combination of constants)`**

Mode for managing the critical sections of procedures and methods:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *threadAuto* | Automatic management of critical sections: each procedure or method can be run by a single thread at a time. |
| *threadCriticalSection*<br>(Default value) | Manual management of critical sections: each procedure or method can be run by several threads simultaneously. In this case, you must protect the accesses to the resources shared between the different threads by critical sections. |

Distribution of the threads on the processors or on the cores:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *threadMonoProcessor* | All the threads of the application are run on a single processor or on a single core. |
| *threadMultiProcessor*<br>(Default value) | The threads are automatically distributed among the different processors or among the different cores. |

![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) The constants corresponding to the repartition of the threads on the processors or on the cores are not available.

Current management modes of threads:

## Remarks


### Managing the multi-processors
<a name="managing_the_multiprocessors_ELTPARAGRAPHE000141"></a>

This option should only be used in some advanced cases.

On a **single-core single-processor** computer, the *threadMonoProcessor* and *threadMultiProcessor* constants have no influence.

On a **multi-core or multi-processor** computer:

- The *threadMonoProcessor* mode forces the application to use a single processor or a single core.

- The *threadMultiProcessor* mode is used to restore the standard operating mode: in this case, the system automatically manage the distribution of the threads on the processors or on the cores.
