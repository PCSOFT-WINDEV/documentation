`LayoutAdaptSize(<Layout control>)`
---

**`<Layout control>: (Control name)`**

<a name="NOTE0"></a>
<a name="NOTE0_1"></a>

## Remarks


- Resizing the Layout control may resize its parent controls (especially if none of them is anchored to content). 

- Resizing the Layout control may not be possible or it may be limited by the constraints of control and/or parent controls: min/max size reached, anchoring, presence of scrollbar, ...

- The overflow options of Layout control are ignored. 

- The option allowing (or not) the reduction of parent is ignored. **Reminder**: By default, the checkmark "Reduce the parent" performs the reduction when initializing the window (the window reduction is not performed during the execution). **LayoutAdaptSize** is used to reduce the parent of Layout control at any time.
