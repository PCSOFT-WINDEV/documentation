The **diagRectangle** type is used to define all the advanced characteristics of a shape of type Rectangle. The characteristics of this shape can be defined and changed using different WLanguage properties. 

**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

## Example


```wl
// Create a rectangle shape
MyShape is diagRectangle

// Set the dimensions, position and background color
MyShape.X = 100
MyShape.Y = 100
MyShape.Width = 350
MyShape.Height = 150
MyShape.Background.Color = PastelRed

MyShape.Border.Color = Black
MyShape.Border.Thickness = 2
MyShape.Border.Type = LineDash

// Reference the displayed diagram
MyDiagram is Diagram <- DIAGEDT_MyDiagram

// Add the rectangle shape to the diagram
Add(MyDiagram.Shape, MyShape)
```

## Properties


### Properties specific to **diagRectangle** variables

Remark: The **diagRectangle** type inherits from the [diagShape](../WDLang1/1410088082.md) type. This means all the properties of the [diagShape](../WDLang1/1410088082.md) type are available for the **diagRectangle** type. These properties appear in italics in the list below.

The following properties can be used to handle a shape of type Rectangle:

| Property name | Type used | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *ActionAllowed* | [diagActionAllowed](../WDLang1/1410088840.md) or constant | <br><br>- [diagActionAllowed](../WDLang1/1410088840.md) variable used to define the changes the user can make to the shape.<br><br>- *diagActionNone* constant: no action available. <br><br>- *diagActionAll* constant (Default value): all actions are available. <br><br><br> |
| *Angle* | Real | Angle of rotation of the shape (in degrees). |
| *Background* | Constant, integer or [Color](../WDLang1/1000019661.md) | Background color of the shape. <br>The **Color** property is used to define the background color of the shape. <br>This property can correspond to: <br><br>- an RGB color (returned by [RGB](../WDLang1/3029012.md)),<br><br>- an HSL color (returned by [HSL](../WDLang1/3029057.md)),<br><br>- [a WLanguage preset color](../WDLang5/3010002.md).<br><br>- a variable of type [Color](../WDLang1/1000019661.md). In this case, the opacity specified in the variable is taken into account.<br><br><br> |
| *Border* | [diagBorder](../WDLang1/1410088179.md) | Characteristics of the shape border. <br>The available properties are: <br><br>- Color: border color. <br><br>- Thickness: border thickness. <br><br>- Type: border type.<br><br><br> |
| *Comment* | Character string | Note about the shape. This note is not displayed. |
| *ConnectionPoint* | Array of [diagConnectionPoint](../WDLang1/1410088457.md) | List of connection points of the shape. |
| *Height* | Real | Height of the box that contains the shape before rotation or zoom, expressed in pixels. |
| *Name* | Character string | Shape name. This name will be used for searching, for example, if the shape is in a library. |
| *Note* | Character string | Note associated with the shape. |
| *Opacity* | Integer | Percentage of opacity of the shape. This value ranges from invisible (0) to completely opaque (100). |
| Round | Real | <br><br>- Radius if the corners of the rectangle are rounded<br><br>- 0 otherwise. <br><br><br> |
| *Shadow* | Boolean | <br><br>- <u><u><u>True</u></u></u> if the shape has a shadow, <br><br>- <u><u><u>False</u></u></u> otherwise. <br><br><br> |
| *Text* | [diagText](../WDLang1/1410088393.md) | Text (with formatting) inside the shape. |
| *Width* | Real | Width of the box that contains the shape before rotation or zoom, expressed in pixels. |
| *X* | Real | X-coordinate of the box that contains the shape before rotation or zoom, expressed in pixels. This X-coordinate is relative to the parent of the shape. |
| *Y* | Real | Y-coordinate of the box that contains the shape before rotation or zoom, expressed in pixels. This Y-coordinate is relative to the parent of the shape. |
