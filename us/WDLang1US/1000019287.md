The **Certificate** type is used to handle: 

- the certificates used to sign the strings or the files. 

- the certificates used to sign the emails. In this case, a **Certificate** variable is used by the [Email](../WDLang3/1000018713.md) variables. 

- the certificates used for the [Push notifications](../WDLang3/1000021015.md) sent to iOS applications.




The characteristics of a certificate can be defined and changed using different WLanguage properties. 

**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

### Properties specific to Certificate variables
<a name="properties_specific_certificate_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000043"></a>

The following properties can be used to handle a certificate:


|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Property name** | **Type used** | **Effect** |
| EndValidityDate | DateTime | End date and time of certificate validity. <br><br>**This property is read-only**. |
| FullIssuer | Character string | Full name of certificate issuer. <br><br>**This property is read-only**. |
| Issuer | Character string | Name of the certificate issuer ("Issued by" characteristic). <br><br>**This property is read-only**. |
| KeyUsage | Integer constants | Expected uses for this certificate:  <br><br>- *certificateKeyEncipherment*: Certificate used to encrypt a key. <br><br>- *certificateDataEncipherment*: Certificate used to encrypt data. <br><br>- *certificateKeyExchange*: Certificate used to exchange a key. <br><br>- *certificateNonRepudiation*: Certificate used for non-repudiation. <br><br>- *certificateDigitalSignature*: Certificate used for digital signatures. <br><br>- *certificateSignKey*: Certificate used to sign a key. <br><br><br><br><br>**This property is read-only**. |
| Name | Character string | Name of the person to whom the certificate is given. <br><br>**This property is read-only**. |
| OIDUsage | Array of strings | List of OIDs of the applications that use this certificate. <br><br>**This property is read-only**. |
| Reliability | Integer constant | Trust level of the certificate corresponding to one of the following constants: <br><br>- *certificateExpired*: the expiration date of the certificate is exceeded.<br><br>- *certificateInvalid*: the certificate is invalid.<br><br>- *certificateUntrusted*: the certificate cannot be trusted. <br><br>- *certificateOk*: the certificate can be trusted. <br><br><br>**This property is read-only**. |
| SerialNumber | Character string | Serial number of the certificate. <br><br>**This property is read-only**. |
| StartValidityDate | DateTime | Start date and time of certificate validity. <br><br>**This property is read-only**. |
| Subject | Character string | Text to identify the entity associated with the public key. For example: domain for which the certificate is issued and, depending on the type of certificate, information about the company that runs the site, validity period, etc.<br><br>**This property is read-only**. |
| ThumbPrint | Character string | Unique number associated with the certificate. This number is automatically created when creating a certificate. <br><br>**This property is read-only**. |
| ValidForSignature | Boolean | <br><br>- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the certificate can be used to sign a document, <br><br>- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. [CertificateSignFile](../WDLang1/1000019297.md) and [CertificateSignString](../WDLang1/1000019296.md) will fail if this property is set to <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>.<br><br><br>This property is used to find out whether the certificate owns a private key as well as all the characteristics required to perform a signature.<br><br>**This property is read-only**. |

### WLanguage functions that use the Certificate type
<a name="wlanguage_functions_that_use_the_certificate_type_ELTPARAGRAPHE000194"></a>

The following functions are used to handle the **Certificate** variables: 

- Standard functions: 
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [CertificateExtract](../WDLang1/1000019300.md) | Extracts a certificate from a signature buffer or from a print duplicate. |
| [CertificateOpenProperties](../WDLang1/1000019301.md) | Opens the Windows window used to find out the properties of a certificate. |
| [CertificateSelect](../WDLang1/1000019295.md) | Opens a window for selecting the certificates. The listed certificates are the certificates installed in the personal store. |
| [CertificateSignExecutable](../WDLang1/1000020560.md) | Signs an executable file with a certificate. |
| [CertificateSignFile](../WDLang1/1000019297.md) | Creates the signature of a file. This signature can be stored in a Buffer variable or in a text file. |
| [CertificateSignString](../WDLang1/1000019296.md) | Creates the signature of a character string. |
| [NotifPushSend](../WDLang3/1000020819.md) | Sends a push notification to a mobile device (iOS or Android). |

- Functions that use prefix syntax:
