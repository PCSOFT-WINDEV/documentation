### "Request for refreshing the display" event
<a name="request_for_refreshing_the_display_event_ELTPARAGRAPHE000081"></a>

One of the events associated with the window is "Request for refreshing the display". This event is used to group the code for refreshing the window controls: content of controls, state (visible, grayed, etc.), caption to refresh, etc.

This event can receive parameters. Simply declare a procedure in the event. For example: 


```wl
// Request for refreshing the display
PROCEDURE AskForRefresh(RefreshType is Boolean)
```


This event is started upon request by the following functions: 

- **RequestUpdateUI**: Executes the "Request for refreshing the display" event at the end of the current process (asynchronous execution). 

- [ExecuteUpdateUI](../WDLang1/1000021379.md): Immediately executes the "Request for refreshing the display" event. 

- [RequestUpdateUIParent](../WDLang1/1000022961.md): Executes the "Request for refreshing the display" event of the higher level at the end of the current process (asynchronous execution).

- [ExecuteUpdateUIParent](../WDLang1/1000022961.md): Immediately executes the "Request for refreshing the display" event of the higher level.
When these functions are called, you can specify the value of the parameters expected by "Request for refreshing the display". 

Remark: The code that calls **RequestUpdateUI** determines the element whose event "Request for display update" is executed. If it is a class with the **presenter** attribute, the element will be the window associated with the class. Otherwise, it will be the element from which the code was executed.

### "Presenter" attribute
<a name="presenter_attribute_ELTPARAGRAPHE000116"></a>

The **presenter** attribute is used to associate a class of the presenter layer with a view (window, page or report). 

This attribute is mainly used in the global declaration of the windows generated by the MVP RAD in WINDEV. 

For example: 


```wl
PROCEDURE WIN_Table_MyExampleFile(...
	gclPresenter is PTableMyExampleFile dynamic<presenter>=Null)
```


With this attribute, the "Request for refreshing the display" window event will be triggered by:

- any call to [RequestUpdateUI](../WDLang1/1000021378.md) from a class declared as &lt;presenter&gt;, 

- any call from any class associated with the &lt;presenter&gt; class.
