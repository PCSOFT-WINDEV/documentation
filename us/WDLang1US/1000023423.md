## Syntax

`<Result> = <TreeView control>.Find(<Element to find> [, <Path of source element> [, <Options>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Character string)`**



- Path of element found. This string can contain specific control characters. This string can be used in all the functions that manage TreeView controls. This path has the following format: 
	
	```txt
	"<Root name>" + TAB + ["<Name of 1st node>" + TAB + ...
	["<Name of 2nd node>" + TAB + [...]]]"<Leaf name>"
	```


- Empty string ("") if no element corresponds to the search.




**`<TreeView control>: (Control name)`**

Name of the TreeView control to be used.

**`<Element to find>: (Character string or integer)`**

Identifier of element to find. This identifier must be identical to the one used in [&lt;TreeView&gt;.Add](../WDLang1/1000023422.md), [&lt;TreeView&gt;.Insert](../WDLang1/1000023761.md) or [&lt;TreeView&gt;.Modify](../WDLang1/1000023763.md).

**`<Path of source element>: (Optional character string)`**

Path of source element for the search in the TreeView control. If this parameter is not specified or if it corresponds to the *Null* constant, the search is performed from the root of TreeView control.

**`<Options>: (Optional constant (or combination of constants))`**

Specifies the search characteristics:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *tvLeaf* | Search performed on the leaves of TreeView control. |
| *tvNode* | Search performed on the nodes of TreeView control. |
| *tvOneLevel* | Search performed on a single level of tree structure (the elements found below the source branch are ignored). The search is performed on the child elements of source element. |


By default, the search is performed with *tvLeaf* + *tvNode* (all elements found in the TreeView control are browsed).
