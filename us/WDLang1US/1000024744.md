Applies a computation to each element of a WLanguage array.


<a name="Example1"></a>
<a name="sample_code"></a>

## Example


```wl
arrValue is array of int	= [1,2,3,4,5]
TheSum is int
TheSum = Reduce(arrValue, (Value, ...
	SumCalculationVariable) => { RESULT Value + SumCalculationVariable}, 0)
Trace(TheSum)

// note: this example is for illustrative purposes; to find the sum of elements of an array, 
// it is preferable to use the Sum function
```



```wl
// -> count the number of strings in an array that contain the letter "e"
// (Prefix syntax)
arr3 is array of strings = ["a","one","some","our","their"]
let Cpt = Reduce(arr3, ( Source, Total ) => { RESULT Total
   + ( Source [=] "e"? 1 ELSE 0 ) }, 0 )
// Cpt = 3
```

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = Reduce(<Array> , <Operation to perform> [, <Initial value>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Type corresponding to the result)`**

Result of the requested reduce operation.

**`<Array>: (WLanguage array)`**

Name of the Array variable to use. This array must be a one-dimensional array.

**`<Operation to perform>: (WLanguage procedure)`**

Name of WLanguage procedure to run. This procedure can be: 

- a global or local procedure,

- an internal procedure. 


It is also possible to directly use a lambda. 

**`<Initial value>: (Optional parameter, type corresponding to the initial value)`**

Initial value to use the first time the &lt;Operation to perform&gt; procedure is run.

## Remarks


### Operating mode
<a name="operating_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000078"></a>

The &lt;Operation to perform&gt; procedure is called a first time with two parameters: 

- the first element of the array,

- the initial value specified with &lt;Initial value&gt;.




The procedure is then called for all other elements of the array with two parameters: 

- the element of the array,

- the value returned by the previous call.




**Illustrative example**
Let's study the following example:

```wl
TheSum = Reduce(arrValue, Adds, 0)
	
INTERNAL PROCEDURE Adds(Value, Total)
	RESULT Value + Total
END
```
In this example, the code:
```wl
TheSum = Reduce(arrValue, (Value, TheSum) => { RESULT Value + TheSum }, 0)
```
is equivalent to the following code:
```wl
arrValue is array of int = [1,2,3,4,5]
TheSum is int
TheSum = Reduce(arrValue, (Value, TheSum) => { RESULT Value + TheSum }, 0)
```
With this internal procedure, the calculation can be broken down as follows: 

- IntermediateResult1 = Adds (t[1], InitialValue): in the example Adds( 1, 0 ) -> 1

- IntermediateResult2 = Adds (t[2], IntermediateResult1): in the example Adds( 2, 1 ) -> 3

- ...


Note: this example is for illustrative purposes; to find the sum of elements of an array, it is preferable to use [Sum](../WDLang1/1000019892.md).

### Existing computations
<a name="existing_computations_ELTPARAGRAPHE000136"></a>The most common computations are available in WLanguage: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [Mean](../WDLang1/1000019891.md) | Calculates the mean of several elements: <br><br>- elements found in an array, <br><br>- numeric values, ...<br><br><br> |
| [Sum](../WDLang1/1000019892.md) | Calculates the sum of the array elements. |







**Sequence of functions**
You can use array functions in a sequence. 
The following functions can be used in a sequence: 

- [Filter](../WDLang1/1000024845.md)

- [Map](../WDLang1/1000024734.md)

- [Union](../WDLang1/1000025408.md)

- [Intersect](../WDLang1/1000025407.md)

- [Distinct](../WDLang1/1000025406.md). 


This sequence can be used as a source for a FOR ALL statement or it can end with one of the following functions: 

- [Apply](../WDLang1/1000024856.md)

- [Reduce](../WDLang1/1000024744.md)

- [Min](../WDLang1/3050004.md)

- [Max](../WDLang1/3050005.md)

- [Sum](../WDLang1/1000019892.md)

- [Mean](../WDLang1/1000019891.md)

- [CheckAllFalse](../WDLang1/1000024858.md), [CheckAllTrue](../WDLang1/1000024857.md), [CheckAnyFalse](../WDLang1/1000024860.md), [CheckAnyTrue](../WDLang1/1000024859.md). 




Example: 

```wl
gnMean = garrUser.Filter(cbFilter).Map(cbMap).Mean()
```

### Equivalence
<a name="equivalence_ELTPARAGRAPHE000150"></a>

The [FOR EACH](../Motscles/1510016.md) syntax also allows you to browse through the elements of an array to perform reduce operations.
