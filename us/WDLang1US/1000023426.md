## Example


```wl
// Retrieve an integer included between 0 and 2 147 483 647
ResRandom = RandomCryptoInteger()
// Retrieve an integer included between 0 and 34
ResRandom = RandomCryptoInteger(34)
// Retrieve an integer included between 7 and 21
ResRandom = RandomCryptoInteger(7, 21)
```

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

### Calculating a random number

`<Result> = RandomCryptoInteger()`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**



- Random integer (included between 0 and 2 147 483 647),

- -1 if an error occurred. 





<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Calculating a random number with an upper bound

`<Result> = RandomCryptoInteger(<Upper bound>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**



- Random integer (included between 0 and the upper bound, inclusive) 

- -1 if an error occurred.




**`<Upper bound>: (Integer)`**

Upper bound of returned number (included between 1 and 2 147 483 647).


<a name="SYNTAX3"></a>

### Calculating a random number with a lower bound and an upper bound

`<Result> = RandomCryptoInteger(<Lower bound> , <Upper bound>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**



- Random integer (included between the lower and upper bounds, inclusive),

- -1 if an error occurred.




**`<Lower bound>: (Integer)`**

Lower bound of returned number (included between 0 and 2 147 483 647)

**`<Upper bound>: (Integer)`**

Upper bound of returned number (included between 1 and 2 147 483 647)

## Remarks


- The first call to the function can be quite long (about one second) because initializing the random mechanism is very complex.

- [InitRandom](../WDLang1/3013030.md) has no effect on the result of **RandomCryptoInteger**.
