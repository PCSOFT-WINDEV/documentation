## Syntax

`TestWriteResult(<Type of information> , <Text to Write>)`
---

**`<Type of information>: (Integer constant)`**

Type of information to write:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *twrError* | Used to write an error into the status report of the test. The test continues until it fails (WLanguage error for example).<br> If an error was written, the test is displayed as failed in the test manager. |
| *twrInfo* | An information is written into the status report of the test. |


The type of information to write can be combined with the *twrCallingProcess* constant. 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *twrCallingProcess* | Used to write a custom check procedure. <br>When **TestWriteResult** is called from the custom procedure, the results of **TestWriteResult** will be referenced in the call to the custom procedure (and not in the call to **TestWriteResult**). <br>Therefore, a double click performed in the results of the test will open the code editor on the call to the custom check procedure. |



**`<Text to Write>: (Character string)`**

Information to write into the status report of the unit test.
