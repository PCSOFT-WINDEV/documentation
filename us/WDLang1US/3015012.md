## Example


```wl
// Wait during 1s
Wait(100, waitRedraw)
```

## Syntax

`Wait(<Timeout> [, <Type>])`
---

**`<Timeout>: (Integer)`**

Timeout in hundredths of a second. 

- The function has no effect if a negative value is used. 

- If this parameter is set to 0, the function processes all the pending events and takes control immediately.


Regardless of the parameter value, the [optional processes](../WDChamp/1014004.md) of controls are always run.
Remark: This parameter can correspond to: 

- an integer corresponding to the number of hundredths of a second,

- a Duration variable,

- the duration in a readable format (e.g., '1s' or '10cs'). 




**`<Type>: (Optional constant)`**

Type of event that can be run during the wait:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *waitMouseAndKeyboard* | The windows and the controls can be redrawn.<br>The timers can be run.<br>The mouse actions (click on controls for example) or the keyboard events can be run.<br>**Remark**: This constant is equivalent to [Multitask](../WDLang1/3015004.md) used with a negative value. |
| *waitNothing* | No event can be run. |
| *waitRedraw*<br>(by default) | The windows and the controls can be redrawn. |
| *waitTimer* | The windows and the controls can be redrawn.<br>The timers can be run.<br>**Remark**: This constant is equivalent to [Multitask](../WDLang1/3015004.md) used with a positive value. |

## Remarks




### Stop
<a name="stop_ELTPARAGRAPHE000084"></a>

The stop only affects the current thread. The other threads continue to run normally.

### Tips/Notes
<a name="tipsnotes_ELTPARAGRAPHE000092"></a>

- It is recommended to use [ThreadPause](../WDLang1/3077029.md) or [ServiceWait](../WDLang1/1000018712.md) instead of [Multitask](../WDLang1/3015004.md) or **Wait** when several threads are used (including for the main application thread) if the timer does not have to process user actions.

- **Wait** prevents the process from ending as long as the requested temporization is not completed. We advise you not to use a long temporization but to perform several short temporizations in a loop. For example, you can replace: 
	
	```wl
	Wait(10000, waitMouseAndKeyboard)
	```

	by:
	
	```wl
	LOOP (100)
		Wait(100, waitMouseAndKeyboard)
	END
	```


- In a Service application, **Wait** must be replaced with [ServiceWait](../WDLang1/1000018712.md).
