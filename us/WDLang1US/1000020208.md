## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`mlzDelete(<Multiline Zone control> [, <Position>])`
---

**`<Multiline Zone control>: (Control name)`**

Name of the Multiline Zone control to be used.

**`<Position>: (Optional integer)`**

Index of the row to delete. 

- If this parameter is not specified, the deletion will be performed on the current row (if it is a dynamic row). **mlzDelete** triggers a fatal error if no dynamic row is selected.

- **mlzDelete** triggers a fatal error if &lt;Position&gt; is greater than the number of rows.

- The index must match the index of a dynamic row (added by [mlzAddLine](../WDLang1/1000020199.md) or [mlzInsertLine](../WDLang1/1000020207.md)). If the Multiline Zone control contains static rows and dynamic rows, the number of static rows must be taken into account.

## Remarks
The size of the Multiline Zone control is modified to take the deleted row into account: the control is reduced from the bottom. If controls are located below the Multiline Zone control, they are moved to the top. The useful window height is reduced accordingly.
