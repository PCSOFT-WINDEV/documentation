## Syntax

`<Result> = FinRepayVal([<Initial capital> [, <Number of periods> [, <Rate>]]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Real or currency)`**

Amount of regular payments.

**`<Initial capital>: (Optional real or currency)`**

Initial capital (0 by default). This parameter indicates the amount on which the calculation must be performed.

In the "standard" case of a borrower, this capital is borrowed and therefore it corresponds to a negative value.

If this parameter is positive, the calculation is performed for a lender. The returned value is negative: this value corresponds to the amount that must be paid.

**`<Number of periods>: (Optional integer)`**

Total number of periods for the operation (1 by default).

**`<Rate>: (Optional real)`**

Interest rate of investment expressed in percentage (1 by default). For example, for a 5% rate, this parameter will be set to 5.

## Remarks




### Time unit
<a name="time_unit_ELTPARAGRAPHE000081"></a>

The calculations can be performed according to months or years. &lt;Rate&gt; and &lt;Period&gt; must correspond to the same unit.

Therefore, for monthly payments of a 4-year loan with a yearly interest rate set to 12%, use:

- &lt;Rate&gt; = 12% / 12, 

- &lt;Number of periods&gt; = 4\*12




For the same loan with yearly payments, use:

- &lt;Rate&gt; = 12%, 

- &lt;Number of periods&gt; = 4




For all the parameters, the payments are represented by a negative number while the collections are represented by a positive number.
