Returns the runtime status report of a DDE function.

Indeed, most of the DDE functions return <u><u><u>True</u></u></u> if successful and <u><u><u>False</u></u></u> if a problem occurs. **DDEError** returns the error details. You can also use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) to get the error code.

**Caution**: **DDEError** and [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) do not return the same error codes if a DDE error occurs. Indeed, **DDEError** returns the Windows error code while [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) returns an error code specific to WINDEV or WEBDEV.

		CASE 6: Error("The recipient is unknown")
	END
