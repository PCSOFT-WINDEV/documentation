Closes a WINDEV window (and returns a value if necessary).

![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png)![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) This function is available only to simplify the Webification of WINDEV projects. In a WEBDEV site, this function has the same behavior as [PageCloseDialog](../WDLang2/1000017166.md) or [ContextClose](../WDLang2/3058003.md), according to each case.

## Syntax

`Close([<Window> [, <Returned value> [... [, <Returned value N>]]]])`
---

**`<Window>: (Optional window name)`**

Name of window to close. If this parameter is not specified or if it corresponds to an empty string (""), the current window is closed.

**`<Returned value>: (Type corresponding to the returned value (optional))`**

Value returned by the window when it is closed. 
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This value is retrieved only if the window was opened by [Open](../WDLang1/3038035.md). 
![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) This value is retrieved only if the window was opened by  [OpenMobileWindow](../WDLang1/1000021018.md) (or by [OpenChild](../WDLang1/3038021.md)).

You have the ability to return: 

- simple types (character string, boolean, ...). 

- advanced types: structure, dynamic structure, class, advanced type, array, associative array, queue, stack, list.






**`<Returned value N>: (Type corresponding to the returned value (optional))`**

## Remarks


### Codes executed at closing
<a name="codes_executed_closing_ELTPARAGRAPHE000152"></a>

- When closing a window:

	1. The current process is permanently interrupted.

	2. The "Closing" event of the window is executed.




- If [SetFocusAndReturnToUserInput](../WDLang1/1410088107.md) is called in the "Closing" event, the window is not closed.

- If **Close** is run in a procedure called by [Timer](../WDLang1/3015008.md), [WinStatus](../WDLang1/3038030.md) or [CurrentWin](../WDLang1/3038033.md) must be used to confirm the existence of the window to close, otherwise all open windows may be closed. For example:
	
	```wl
	// Procedure called by timer
	Window is string 
	Window = CurrentWin()
	IF Window <> "Window name" THEN
		Close()
	END
	```




<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Closing according to the type of window
<a name="closing_according_the_type_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000180"></a>

- If the window to close is a parent window with child windows, these child windows will be closed first (their closing code is run).

- If the window to close is a child window, the parent window becomes the current window. The "gain of focus" code of parent window is run.



<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Last project window
<a name="last_project_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000188"></a>

If the last window is closed, the "Closing" event of the project is executed before the end of the program.

### Value returned to the Open function
<a name="value_returned_the_open_function_ELTPARAGRAPHE000208"></a>

**Close** can be used to return one or more values to [Open](../WDLang1/3038035.md).

Reminder: A value can also be returned by the [ReturnedValue](../Proprietes/2510134.md) property (&lt;Window name&gt;.*ReturnedValue*) run before **Close**. In this case, a single value can be returned. 

Examples: 

- The user must type a password in a window. This password is retrieved when this window is closed and it is returned to [Open](../WDLang1/3038035.md):
	
	```wl
	MyPassword = Open(WIN_EditPassword)
	IF MyPassword <> "" THEN
		Info("Wrong password") 
	END
	
	// -- Click code on "OK" button in the "WIN_EditPassword" window
	// Users enter their password in the EDT_Password control 
	// and validates the window.
	Close("", EDT_Password)
	```


- The user must enter a username and a password in a window. The username and password are retrieved when the window is closed and returned to [Open](../WDLang1/3038035.md): 
	
	```wl
	(MyUsername, MyPassword) = Open(WIN_EditPassword)
	IF MyUsername <> "" OR MyPassword <> "" THEN 
		Info("Wrong username or password")
	END
	
	// -- Click code on "OK" button in the "WIN_EditPassword" window
	// Users enter their username and password 
	// in the EDT_Password control and validates the window.
	Close("", EDT_Username, EDT_Password)
	```

### Value returned when closing a child window
<a name="value_returned_when_closing_child_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000248"></a>

**Close** is used to return a value to the parent window that opened the child window.

Reminder: A value can also be returned by the [ReturnedValue](../Proprietes/2510134.md) property (&lt;Window name&gt;.*ReturnedValue*) run before **Close**.

The value returned by the child window can be read in the "Closing a child window" event of the window that opened it (the one that called [OpenMobileWindow](../WDLang1/1000021018.md) or [OpenChild](../WDLang1/3038021.md)): simply use the [ReturnedValue](../Proprietes/2510134.md) property on the [MyChildWindow](../Motscles/1511021.md) keyword.

For example:

- In the closing code of the child window, [Close](../WDLang1/3038018.md) is used to return a parameter: 
	
	```wl
	Close("", MyParameter)
	```


- The name of the child window as well as the returned value can be retrieved in the "Closing a child window" event of the calling window, using the [MyChildWindow](../Motscles/1511021.md) keyword: 
	
	```wl
	// Close a child window
	NameChildWindow = MyChildWindow.Name
	ValueChildWindow = MyChildWindow.ReturnedValue
	```

### Alt + F4 keys
<a name="alt_keys_ELTPARAGRAPHE000293"></a>

Pressing Alt + F4 can trigger several behaviors:

- If the window contains an "Abandon" button, the WLanguage event associated with the abandon button is executed.

- If the window has a button with Alt + F4 as keyboard shortcut, the WLanguage event associated with this button is executed.

- If the window does not contain an "abandon" button, or a button with Alt + F4 as keyboard shortcut, the closing process of the window is executed and the window is closed (except if [SetFocusAndReturnToUserInput](../WDLang1/1410088107.md) is called).

- If a window is opened from a program in external language, Alt + F4 returns "ESC" in WdKey.

### Equivalence
<a name="equivalence_ELTPARAGRAPHE000308"></a>The following line of code: 


```txt
WinStatus(<Window>, NotFound)
```
is equivalent to: 


```txt
Close(<Window>)
```
