ReplicSynchro and ReplicAdmin are used to synchronize the application data:

- [ReplicSynchro](../ReplicSynchro/3526551.md) can only be used to perform the synchronization. This tool must be used to perform a simple synchronization of data.

- [ReplicAdmin](../ReplicSynchro/3526552.md) is used to configure the synchronizations and to perform the synchronization. It is the replication manager.
