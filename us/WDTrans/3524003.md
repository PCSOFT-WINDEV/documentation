To cancel the operations performed on a transaction file:

1. Start WDTrans.

2. Select "Cancel a transaction". 

3. Select the transaction file with the file picker. 
	The list of data files (with their full path) currently in transaction is displayed. For each file, the identifier of the computer that performs an operation in transaction is displayed.

4. If some data files are password protected, specify the password. Indeed, this password is required to cancel the transaction.

5. Disable (if necessary) the management of duplicates and/or integrity.  

6. Click the "Cancel the transaction" button. The transaction is canceled.

| /Mdp = &lt;Password&gt; | Password associated with the file to process (single file) |
| /Option = &lt;Type of action to perform&gt; | Option of WDTrans to run. To cancel the operations performed on a transaction file, this option corresponds to 6. |
| /Log = &lt;Log File&gt; | Full path of the log file (.LOG) to create. |



**Example**: Cancel the transactions saved in the "WD Transactions.TRS" file:

```
