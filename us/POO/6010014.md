## Error caption
<a name="error_caption_ELTTEXTE000113"></a>
The '&lt;method&gt;' methods of the '&lt;derived class&gt;' class and of the '&lt;base class&gt;' class do not have the same prototype. The compiler cannot solve the ambiguity between a redefined method and a multi-syntax method.





## Explanations
<a name="explanations_ELTTEXTE000137"></a>
This error is caused when using different syntaxes for a method with the same name found both in a base class and in a class derived from the base class. 

Indeed, when a method found in the base class and in the derived class does not have the same prototype, the compiler cannot decide:

- whether it is an error in the existing code.

- whether the expected behavior is a redefinition of the method. The redefinition of method was available in the earlier versions. 

- whether the expected behavior is an additional syntax for the method (new feature in version 16).




For a redefined method, the manipulation of an instance of the derived class always runs the methods of the derived class. 

For a method that uses different prototypes (multi-syntax), the execution will use the best syntax found according to the specified parameters. 

The redefinition of method and the use of a multi-syntax method are written in the same way in the code editor. 

To avoid this ambiguity, the compiler displays this error in order to get a clearer code.


### Example 1
<a name="example_1_ELTPARAGRAPHE000029"></a>

A derived class is defined. This class also uses a method named "Method1" but with a different prototype: the type of the parameter is different. In this case, the compilation error is displayed.

### Example 2
<a name="example_2_ELTPARAGRAPHE000036"></a>

A derived class is defined. This class also uses a method named "Method2" but with a different prototype: "Method2" of the base class expects no parameter and "Method2" of the derived class expects 2 parameters. In this case, the compilation error is displayed. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ERR_Redef_Syntaxe2.gif)






## Solutions
<a name="solutions_ELTTEXTE000173"></a>
Three cases may occur: 

- **1st case: It is an error: the two methods should have the same prototype.**
	**Solution**: Correct the prototypes

- **2nd case: The redefinition of the method with a different prototype was done on purpose.** 
	This operating mode corresponds to the default operating mode until version 15. 

	- **Solution 1**: Add the attribute whose extension is &lt;override&gt; to the method of the derived class. 
			
		```txt
		PROCEDURE method([<Parameters>]) <override>
		```


	- **Solution 2**: Rename the method of the derived class. 




- **3rd case: The method of the derived class must be considered as being an additional syntax of the method of the base class (use of multi-syntax)**
	**Solution**: Add the attribute whose extension is &lt;overload&gt; to the method of the derived class.
	For more details, see [Managing the overload](../Motscles/1514063.md). 
	
	```txt
	PROCEDURE method([<Parameters>]) <overload>
	```
