<a name="NOTE1"></a>

The retrieval and assignment processes can be public, private or protected. The access rights of the property correspond to the less restrictive rights of the two processes.

![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) The class properties are not available.

**Access rights of the property according to the access rights of the processes**: 


|   |   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Assignment process<br>/<br>Retrieval process** | **Public** | **Protected** | **Private** |
| Public | Public | Public | Public |
| Protected | Public | Protected | Protected |
| Private | Public | Protected | Private |


The properties are accessible on the instances and by inheritance by respecting the standard restrictions of the public, protected and private inheritances.

If the access rights allow reading and not writing, the property is considered read-only.

If the access rights allow writing and not reading, the property is considered write-only.

These cases trigger an error during the compilation but no error is triggered at runtime.
