## Remarks


- The signature applied by **PDFSign** is an approval signature. The PDF file can be signed and countersigned several times.

- This signature must correspond to a control of PDF file (its minimum size will be set to 1 X 1 mm²). The Signature control can be invisible but we advise you to associate it with a caption or an image in order for the user to see this signature and to click it. 

- The encrypted PDF files (with password) are not supported. 

- The PDF files whose version is later than PDF 1.5 will be saved in version PDF 1.4 before they can be signed. 




- **Caution**: For Acrobat to recognize a signed PDF file, the organization that creates the signing certificate must be in the Adobe Approved Trust List ([Adobe Authorized Trust List](https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/kb/trust-services.html)) or in the Certified Document Services program (CDS). 
	If the certificate is not recognized, Acrobat will display the following message: "At least one signature has problems".
