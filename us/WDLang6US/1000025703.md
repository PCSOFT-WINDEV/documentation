## Example


```wl
MyImage is Image
MyTextBlockArray is array of ocrTextBlock
MyTextBlockArray = OCRExtractTextBlock(MyImage)
```

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = OCRExtractTextBlock(<Image to use>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Array of ocrTextBlock variables)`**

Array of [ocrTextBlock](../WDLang6/1000025639.md) variables. 

**`<Image to use>: (Control name, Image variable, character string)`**

Image in which the text blocks must be detected. The image can correspond to: 

- an Image control, 

- an Image variable,

- an Image Memo item, 

- the path of an image file. 

- the path of PDF file.
	Caution: this file must contain only one page. 
	Reminder: you can extract a page from a PDF file as an image using [PDFExtractPage](../WDLang6/1000021279.md). This image can be processed by **OCRExtractTextBlock**.

## Remarks


- ![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png)![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) Legacy and LSTM engines can be used in WINDEV applications (Windows and Linux). LSTM models are provided by default.

- The .traineddata models are required.




- To get the best results possible, it is recommended to: 

	- Use a high-resolution image.

	- Crop the image around the text if possible (avoid unnecessary areas).

	- Limit text skew. If the image is slightly skewed, OCR may be able to detect the text, but the quality will be affected. 
			

	- Limit the number of models/languages used.




- Note that, if the image used corresponds to an Image control, the source image will be directly manipulated. Therefore, the changes made in the Image control (image size for example) will not be taken into account. To apply these changes, it is necessary to save the image. 

- Note that, if the image used (via an Image control or not) is a PDF file, its quality will be set to 300 DPI.

- OCR can only detect printed text. It cannot recognize handwritten text.
