## Remarks




### Compilation
<a name="compilation_ELTPARAGRAPHE000052"></a>

A compilation corresponds to the set of files that must be burned on a CD or DVD. This compilation will be taken into account next time [BurnerSave](../WDLang6/3061006.md) is called.

A compilation is automatically created during the first call to [BurnerAddFile](../WDLang6/3061001.md) or to [BurnerAddDirectory](../WDLang6/3061002.md). A single compilation can be created at a time.

A compilation is automatically deleted:

- when changing the type of CD/DVD to burn ([BurnerMediaType](../WDLang6/3061013.md)).

- when selecting the default burner ([BurnerSelect](../WDLang6/3061012.md)).

- after the call to [BurnerSave](../WDLang6/3061006.md) (only if the burn process was started, &lt;Result&gt; is set to <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>).

- when canceling the burn process (**BurnerCancel**).

- when closing the current WINDEV application or WEBDEV site.
