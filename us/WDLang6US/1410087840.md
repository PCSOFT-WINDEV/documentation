## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = ScanWithUserInterface(<Scanner> [, <File path>] [, <Options>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Array)`**

Array of strings containing the paths of the scanned files. 
If an error occurs, the [ErrorOccurred](../WDLang1/3087001.md) variable is set to <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> and [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) returns the corresponding error message.

**`<Scanner>: (Scanner variable)`**

Name of the [Scanner](../WDLang6/1410087808.md) variable initialized with the details of the scanner used. Only the name of the scanner will be taken into account. The other scanner parameters will be determined by the options chosen by the user in the scanner's UI.

**`<File path>: (Optional character string)`**

Name and full (or relative) path of file (up to 260 characters). The file extension will be ignored since it will depend on the type of file chosen by the user. A UNC path can be used.
The name of each scanned file will be indexed so as not to overwrite an existing file.
If this path is not specified, the files will be generated in the current directory with "scan" as a prefix (for example, if the user has selected the bmp format, a "scan.bmp" file will be generated).

**`<Options>: (Combination of optional Integer constants)`**

Scan options with the user interface:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *scanUIOptionDefault*<br> (Default value) | Uses the default options. |
| *scanUIOptionSingleImage* | Restricts the user interface to scan one single file.<br><br>Remark: Some scanners do not support this option. |
| *scanUIOptionSystem* | Displays the system user interface, if available, instead of the scanner-specific user interface. |
