Retrieves the characteristics of current compilation.

**Remark**: A compilation corresponds to the set of files that must be burnt on a CD or DVD. This compilation will be taken into account next time [BurnerSave](../WDLang6/3061006.md) is called.
A compilation is automatically created during the first call to [BurnerAddFile](../WDLang6/3061001.md) or to [BurnerAddDirectory](../WDLang6/3061002.md). A single compilation can be created at a time.

A compilation is automatically deleted:

- when changing the type of CD/DVD to burn ([BurnerMediaType](../WDLang6/3061013.md)).

- when selecting the default burner ([BurnerSelect](../WDLang6/3061012.md)).

- after the call to [BurnerSave](../WDLang6/3061006.md) (only if the burn process was started, &lt;Result&gt; is set to <u><u><u>True</u></u></u>).

- when canceling the burn process ([BurnerCancel](../WDLang6/3061003.md)).

- when closing the current WINDEV application or WEBDEV site.

## Example


```wl
// Characteristics of compilation
ResNbTracks, ResBlocks, ResBlockSize are int
ResNbTracks = BurnerCompilationInfo(compilationNumberAudioTracks)
ResBlocks = BurnerCompilationInfo(compilationBlocksUsed)
ResBlockSize = BurnerCompilationInfo(compilationBlockSize)
 
Info("The compilation contains: " + ResNbTracks + " tracks ", ...
	"and it is using " + ResBlocks + " blocks of " + ResBlockSize + " bytes each.")
```

## Syntax

`<Result> = BurnerCompilationInfo(<Type of characteristic>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer constant)`**



- Requested characteristic, 

- -1 if an error occurred. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) with the *errMessage* constant. 


This function cannot be used if no CD is inserted into the burner.

**`<Type of characteristic>: (Integer constant)`**

Type of characteristic to retrieve:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *compilationBlockSize* | Size of block (in bytes).<br>The block size depends on the type of compilation (data or audio). |
| *compilationBlocksUsed* | Number of blocks found in the current compilation.<br>This number is updated after each call to [BurnerAddFile](../WDLang6/3061001.md) or [BurnerAddDirectory](../WDLang6/3061002.md). |
| *compilationNumberAudioTracks* | <br><br>- Number of audio tracks found in the current compilation.<br><br>- 0 if the current compilation is a data compilation.<br><br><br>This number is updated after each call to [BurnerAddFile](../WDLang6/3061001.md) or [BurnerAddDirectory](../WDLang6/3061002.md). |

## Remarks




### Block
<a name="block_ELTPARAGRAPHE000108"></a>

- The CD size is expressed in blocks.

- A block corresponds to 2048 bytes on a data CD and to 2352 bytes on an audio CD.

- A second on the CD corresponds to 75 blocks.
