## Remarks


### Tile added from the Tile type
<a name="tile_added_from_the_tile_type_ELTPARAGRAPHE000072"></a>

The tile associated with the application is customized. You have the ability to add up to 5 different customizations. These customizations can be removed by [TileDeleteAll](../WDLang6/1000020720.md).
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Tile added from an URI
<a name="tile_added_from_uri_ELTPARAGRAPHE000082"></a>

A tile added from an URI is used to create a tile with update, even if the application is closed. At the end of each period, the tile will get the content of the XML file found in the URI to perform the udpate.

Remark: The **XML** property of the [Tile](../WDLang6/1000020713.md) type retrieves a valid XML code. 

A recurring tile can be deleted with [TileDeleteAll](../WDLang6/1000020720.md).
