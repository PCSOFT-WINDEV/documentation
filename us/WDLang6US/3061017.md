Several WLanguage functions are used to burn the CDs or DVDs. You can create: 

- data CDs/DVDs.

- audio CDs.




**Remark**: You can only burn files to a CD or DVD. You cannot copy a CD or DVD directly.


### Required configuration

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Burning CDs is available for Windows XP and later. Burning DVDs is available for Windows Vista and for Windows XP when using the KB932716 update for Windows XP (this update must be downloaded from the Microsoft site and installed manually because it is not taken into account by the Live Update mechanism).

## How to burn a CD/DVD?
<a name="how_burn_cddvd_ELTTEXTE000162"></a>
To burn a CD/DVD:

1. Define (if necessary) the burner to use: 
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [BurnerList](../WDLang6/3061009.md) | Returns the list of burners installed on the current computer. |
| [BurnerPath](../WDLang6/3061004.md) | Returns the path of the current burner. |
| [BurnerProperty](../WDLang6/3061011.md) | Used to find out and modify the properties of the current burner. |
| [BurnerSelect](../WDLang6/3061012.md) | Used to select the default burner. |
| [BurnerStatus](../WDLang6/3061007.md) | Returns the status of the current burner. |

2. Open (if necessary) the door of the current burner ([BurnerEject](../WDLang6/3061014.md)).
	**Remark**: To find out whether the burner contains a support, use [BurnerMediaFound](../WDLang6/1000019910.md). 

3. Specify (if necessary) the type of the CD/DVD to create:
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [BurnerMediaInfo](../WDLang6/3061008.md) | Retrieves the characteristics of the CD/DVD found in the current burner. |
| [BurnerMediaType](../WDLang6/3061013.md) | Used to find out and modify the format of the CD or DVD to burn. |

4. Erase (if necessary) the files already found on the CD/DVD via [BurnerErase](../WDLang6/3061005.md). A WLanguage procedure ("callback") is regularly called during this erase process. This procedure is used to manage the different events that occur.

5. Specify (if necessary) the name that will be given to the CD/DVD to burn by using [BurnerVolumeName](../WDLang6/3061019.md).

6. Select the files to burn on the CD/DVD:
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [BurnerAddDirectory](../WDLang6/3061002.md) | Adds all the files found in a directory to the compilation. |
| [BurnerAddFile](../WDLang6/3061001.md) | Adds a file to the compilation. |

7. Retrieve (if necessary) the characteristics of the compilation ([BurnerCompilationInfo](../WDLang6/3061018.md).

8. Burn the selected files onto the CD/DVD with [BurnerSave](../WDLang6/3061006.md). A WLanguage procedure ("callback") is regularly called during this burn process. This procedure is used to manage the different events that occur.

9. Cancel (if necessary) the current burn operation ([BurnerCancel](../WDLang6/3061003.md).
