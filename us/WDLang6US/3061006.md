Burns the files found in the compilation onto the CD or DVD.

During the burn process, **BurnerSave** regularly calls a specific WLanguage procedure. This procedure is used to manage the different events that occur during the burn process.

**Remarks**:

- After **BurnerSave** is called, the current compilation is automatically deleted.

- This function is not locking. To find out if the burning is complete, use the WLanguage procedure regularly called by **BurnerSave**.

## Syntax

`<Result> = BurnerSave(<Burn options> [, <WLanguage procedure> [, <Pointer>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the files are currently burnt onto the CD or DVD,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md).
	To find out if the burning is complete, test the event encountered in the &lt;Procedure name&gt; procedure.




Remark: A CD or a DVD must be found in the burner. This CD/DVD must contain enough space to burn a new session.

**`<Burn options>: (Integer constant (or combination of constants))`**

Option for burning files on the CD or DVD:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *burnerAutoEject* | Opens the burner door at the end of burn process. |
| *burnerFinalize* | Finalizes the media: no other write operation can be performed on the media. <br>Remark:  Nevertheless, the rewritable medias can be erased and re-used. |
| *burnerNoEject* | Does not open the burner door at the end of burn process. |
| *burnerSimulate* | Simulates the burning of CD or DVD. All the steps of the burn process are performed except for the actual burning of files on the CD/DVD. |


By default, the files are actually burned on the CD/DVD (no simulation) and the burner door is not opened at the end of burn process.

**`<WLanguage procedure>: (Optional procedure name)`**

Name of the WLanguage procedure ("callback") regularly called during the burn process. This procedure is used to manage the different events that occur.
This procedure has the following format:


```txt
PROCEDURE <Procedure name>(<Event encountered>, <Event message>, 
	<Procedure pointer>, <Parameter 1>, <Parameter 2>)
```
The parameters of this procedure are optional.
There is no need to pass parameters to this procedure. Indeed, these parameters are automatically filled whenever a file is processed.

**`<Pointer>: (Optional integer)`**

Pointer passed to &lt;Procedure name&gt;.

### Procedure used to manage the different events that occur
<a name="procedure_used_manage_the_different_events_that_occur_ELTPARAGRAPHE000094"></a>

**BurnerSave** regularly calls the &lt;Procedure name&gt; procedure. This procedure is used to manage the different events that occur during the burn process. This procedure is a local or global procedure.

This procedure must be declared as follows:

```txt
PROCEDURE <Procedure name>(<Event encountered>, <Event message>, 
	<Procedure pointer>, <Parameter 1>, <Parameter 2>)
```


- &lt;Event encountered&gt; is a constant indicating the type of event.

- &lt;Event message&gt; is a character string containing the message of the event encountered.

- &lt;Procedure pointer&gt; is an integer whose value is the one passed to the &lt;Pointer&gt; parameter of **BurnerSave**. If &lt;Pointer&gt; is not specified, &lt;Pointer&gt; is set to 0.

- &lt;Parameter 1&gt; and &lt;Parameter 2&gt; are integers containing a value specific to the event that occurred.




The different values are as follows:

| Event | &lt;Event encountered&gt; | &lt;Event message&gt; | &lt;Parameter 1&gt; | &lt;Parameter 2&gt; |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cancel the burn process | *burnerNotificationCancel* | "" | 0 | 0 |
| Error detected | *burnerNotificationError* | Error message | Code of error that occurred | 0 |
| Close the CD/DVD | *burnerNotificationCloseCD* | "" | Duration (in seconds) for closing the CD/DVD | 0 |
| Burn process completed | *burnerNotificationEndBurning* | Error message if &lt;Parameter 1&gt; is different from 0, empty string ("") otherwise | Return code, 0 if no error | 0 |
| Burn a block | *burnerNotificationBurnBlock* | "" | Rank of the current block | Total number of blocks to burn |
| Burn a track | *burnerNotificationBurnTrack* | "" | Rank of the current track | Total number of tracks to burn |
| Prepare to burn | *burnerNotificationPrepareBurning* | "" | Duration (in seconds) for preparing to burn | 0 |
| Other event | ** | Event message | Rank of the current step | Total number of steps to perform |


To get the value of &lt;Procedure pointer&gt;, its value must be assigned to the value of &lt;Pointer&gt; in the procedure with [Transfer](../WDLang1/3014015.md).

**Remark**: The parameters of this procedure are optional: you have the ability to specify the event and the message for example.

### Sessions and tracks
<a name="sessions_and_tracks_ELTPARAGRAPHE000215"></a>

The CDs/DVDs are divided into sessions and tracks. A session corresponds to all the files burned at the same time during a single operation. A track corresponds to a file. A session can contain one or more tracks.

Each new burn operation on the same CD/DVD generates a new session on the CD/DVD.

**Remark**: For an audio CD/DVD, some CD/DVD readers can only read the tracks of the first session.

### Compilation
<a name="compilation_ELTPARAGRAPHE000226"></a>

A compilation corresponds to the set of files that must be burned on a CD or DVD. This compilation will be taken into account next time **BurnerSave** is called.

A compilation is automatically created during the first call to [BurnerAddFile](../WDLang6/3061001.md) or to [BurnerAddDirectory](../WDLang6/3061002.md). A single compilation can be created at a time.

A compilation is automatically deleted:

- when changing the type of CD/DVD to burn ([BurnerMediaType](../WDLang6/3061013.md)).

- when selecting the default burner ([BurnerSelect](../WDLang6/3061012.md)).

- after the call to **BurnerSave** (only if the burn process was started, &lt;Result&gt; is set to <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>).

- when canceling the burn process ([BurnerCancel](../WDLang6/3061003.md)).

- when closing the current WINDEV application or WEBDEV site.

### Burned audio CD/DVD
<a name="burned_audio_cddvd_ELTPARAGRAPHE000266"></a>

You cannot burn a compilation on an audio CD/DVD that is already burned.
<a name="NOTE0_5"></a>


### Required configuration 
<a name="required_configuration_ELTPARAGRAPHE000273"></a>

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Burning CDs is available for Windows XP and later. Burning DVDs is available for Windows Vista and for Windows XP when using the KB932716 update for Windows XP (this update must be downloaded from the Microsoft site and installed manually because it is not taken into account by the Live Update mechanism).
