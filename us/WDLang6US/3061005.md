Erases the files found on a rewritable CD or DVD. This CD (or DVD) must be inserted into the current burner.

A specifc WLanguage procedure is regularly called by **BurnerErase** during the erase process. This procedure is used to manage the different events that occur during the erase process.

**Remarks**:

- The burner can be selected by [BurnerSelect](../WDLang6/3061012.md).

- This function is not locking. To find out if the deletion is complete, use the WLanguage procedure called regularly by **BurnerErase**.

```wl
// Entirely erase the files found on CD
// The burner door will automatically opened at the end of erase process
ResErase is boolean

## Syntax

`<Result> = BurnerErase([<Erase options> [, <WLanguage procedure> [, <Pointer>]]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the files are currently erased from the CD/DVD,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md).


To determine if the erase process is over, test the event encountered in &lt;Procedure name&gt;.

**`<Erase options>: (Optional Integer constant (or combination of constants))`**

Options for erasing files from the CD/DVD:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *burnerAutoEject* | Open the burner door at the end of erase process. |
| *burnerFastErasing* | Quick delete: the files are not entirely deleted from the CD/DVD. Only the references to the CD content will be deleted.<br><br>This method is faster but the files can be restored by a specific software. This method is not recommended if the files found on the CD/DVD contain confidential information. |
| *burnerFullErasing* | Full delete: the files are entirely deleted from the CD/DVD.<br><br>This method can take quite a long time but the deleted files cannot be restored. |
| *burnerNoEject* | Don't open the burner door at the end of erase process. |

By default, the erase process is fast and the burner door is not automatically opened at the end of the erase process.

**`<WLanguage procedure>: (Name of optional procedure)`**

Name of WLanguage procedure ("callback") regularly called during the erase operation. This procedure is used to manage the different events that occur.
This procedure has the following format:


```txt
PROCEDURE <Procedure name>(<Event encountered>, 
	<Event message>, <Procedure pointer>, <Parameter>)
```
The parameters of this procedure are optional.
There is no need to pass parameters to this procedure. Indeed, these parameters are automatically filled whenever a file is processed.

**`<Pointer>: (Optional integer)`**

Pointer passed to &lt;Procedure name&gt;.

### Procedure used to manage the different events that occur
<a name="procedure_used_manage_the_different_events_that_occur_ELTPARAGRAPHE000092"></a>

**BurnerErase** regularly calls the &lt;Procedure name&gt; procedure. This procedure is used to manage the different events that occur during the erase process. This procedure is a local or global procedure.

This procedure must be declared as follows:


```txt
PROCEDURE <Procedure name>(<Event encountered>, <Event message>, 
		<Procedure pointer>, <Parameter>)
```


- &lt;Event encountered&gt; is a constant indicating the type of event.

- &lt;Event message&gt; is a character string containing the message of the event encountered.

- &lt;Procedure pointer&gt; is an integer whose value is the one passed to the &lt;Pointer&gt; parameter of **BurnerErase**. If &lt;Pointer&gt; is not specified, &lt;Pointer&gt; is set to 0.

- &lt;Parameter&gt; is an integer containing a value specific to the event encountered.
	The different values are as follows:
	

| Event | &lt;Event encountered&gt; | &lt;Event message&gt; | &lt;Parameter&gt; |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cancel the erase process | *burnerNotificationCancel* | "" | 0 |
| Deletion (only available on Vista or Windows XP + KB032716) | *burnerNotificationErasing* | "" | In this case, two parameters are managed: <br>***Parameter 1***: Number of seconds since the beginning of the erase operation. <br>***Parameter 2***: Estimated total duration of operation (may change during the erase operation)<br>Caution: This information is returned by the burner and it may be invalid. |
| Error found | *burnerNotificationError* | Error message | Code of error that occurred |
| Erase operation completed | *burnerNotificationEndErasing* | Error message if &lt;Parameter&gt; is different from 0, empty string ("") otherwise | Return code, 0 if no error |
| Other event |   | Event message | 0 |


	To get the value of &lt;Procedure pointer&gt;, its value must be assigned to the value of &lt;Pointer&gt; in the procedure with [Transfer](../WDLang1/3014015.md).




Remark: The parameters of this procedure are optional: you have the ability to specify the event and the message for example.
