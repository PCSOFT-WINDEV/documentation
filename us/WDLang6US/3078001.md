The following functions are used to manage Twain devices:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [TwainCurrentSource](../WDLang6/3078015.md) | Allows you to find out and change the Twain device used by default. |
| [TwainListSource](../WDLang6/3078005.md) | Returns the list of drivers for the Twain devices connected to the current computer. |
| [TwainProperty](../WDLang6/1000021192.md) | Used to find out or modify the properties of the current Twain device. |
| [TwainScanArea](../WDLang6/3078014.md) | Used to define or re-initialize the area to scan. |
| [TwainSelectSource](../WDLang6/3078013.md) | Displays a standard dialog box used to list the different Twain devices available on the current computer. |
| [TwainSourceHeight](../WDLang6/3078003.md) | Returns the height (in millimeters) of the document captured by a Twain device. |
| [TwainSourceWidth](../WDLang6/3078004.md) | Returns the width (in millimeters) of the document captured by a Twain device. |
| [TwainState](../WDLang6/3078002.md) | Returns the status of the current source. |
| [TwainToBMP](../WDLang6/3078010.md) | Allows you to perform one of the following actions:<br><br>- save the document coming from the Twain device in a Bitmap file (".BMP" extension).<br><br>- view the document coming from the Twain device in the user interface of the device. <br><br>- save the document coming from the Twain device directly in memory in Bitmap format (in a buffer).<br><br><br> |
| [TwainToClipboard](../WDLang6/3078011.md) | Allows you to:<br><br>- copy the document coming from the Twain device into the clipboard.<br><br>- view the document coming from the Twain device in the [user interface of device](../WDLang6/3078007.md).<br><br><br> |
| [TwainToControl](../WDLang6/3078008.md) | Allows you to : <br><br>- view the document coming from the Twain device in an Image control.<br><br>- view the document coming from the Twain device in the [user interface of device](../WDLang6/3078007.md).<br><br><br> |
| [TwainToGIF](../WDLang6/3078012.md) | Allows you to:<br><br>- save the document coming from the Twain device in a GIF file.<br><br>- view the document coming from the Twain device in the [user interface of device](../WDLang6/3078007.md).<br><br>- save the document coming from the Twain device directly in memory in GIF format (in a buffer).<br><br><br> |
| [TwainToJPEG](../WDLang6/3078009.md) | Allows you to:<br><br>- save the document coming from the Twain device in a JPEG file.<br><br>- view the document coming from the Twain device in the [user interface of device](../WDLang6/3078007.md).<br><br>- save the document coming from the Twain device directly in memory in JPEG format (in a buffer).<br><br><br> |
| [TwainToPDF](../WDLang6/1000020877.md) | Allows you to:<br><br>- save the document coming from the Twain device in a PDF file.<br><br>- view the document coming from the Twain device in the [user interface of device](../WDLang6/3078007.md). <br><br>- save the document coming from the Twain device directly in memory in PDF format (in a buffer).<br><br><br> |
| [TwainToTIFF](../WDLang6/1000020875.md) | Allows you to:<br><br>- save the document coming from the Twain device in a TIFF file.<br><br>- view the document coming from the Twain device in the [user interface of device](../WDLang6/3078007.md). <br><br>- save the document coming from the Twain device directly in memory in TIFF format (in a buffer).<br><br><br> |

- ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WDPhotocopier.gif) ***Sample components (WINDEV)*** : **WD Photocopier** <br>The Photocopier component enables you to photocopy documents via a scanner and a printer. The scanner must be Twain-compatible in order for the component to operate.<br>This component can be used in two modes:<br>- With an interface used to define some parameters such as the lightness or the number of copies.<br>- Without interface. The parameters of the computer will be used by default. You also have the ability to pass custom parameters
