WEBDEV allows you to create control templates. A control template is a set of controls that can be reused in several pages.

The changes made in a control template are automatically applied to all pages using this template.

A control template is used to:

- group a set of controls for a specific purpose.

- make the controls independent of the page that hosts them.

Template used in a page.
Elements from the template have a red border and are identified by a yellow square.

To use a control template in a page, create a "Control template" control.

**Remark**: The programming associated with the template elements can be performed in the template directly.

The characteristics of the elements can be dissociated from the template. For example, dissociate the position of a control from the template to move it elsewhere while keeping other changes (code, style, etc.). This is referred to as **control inheritance**. In this case, the elements are identified by a blue square.
