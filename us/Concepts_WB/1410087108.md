## What is an Active WEBDEV Page?
<a name="what_active_webdev_page_ELTTEXTE000144"></a>
An Active WEBDEV Page is a dynamic WEBDEV page **without persistent context** on the server. The Active WEBDEV Page context is temporary. It is created in a temporary session.

**Reminder**: In a WEBDEV site in Session mode, each displayed page owns a persistent page context for the entire lifetime of the session on the server.

## Operating mode of AWP sites
<a name="operating_mode_awp_sites_ELTTEXTE000168"></a>
The following elements are automatically created on the server when an Active WEBDEV Page is displayed in the browser:

- a temporary session,

- a temporary Active WEBDEV Page context.




The **temporary session** contains the temporary Active WEBDEV Page context. When the Active WEBDEV Page is sent to the Web user, the temporary page context and the temporary session are destroyed. There is nothing left in memory on the server.

The **temporary Active WEBDEV Page context** contains all elements that have been required to build the page viewed by the Web user:

- local variables,

- server processes,

- database connections,

- contexts of data files, etc.


When the Active WEBDEV Page is sent to the Web user, these elements are destroyed.

## How to share information (values) between Active WEBDEV Pages?
<a name="how_share_information_values_between_active_webdev_pages_ELTTEXTE000192"></a>
There are two methods to share information (values) between Active WEBDEV Pages: 

- Passing information in the URL. This method allows for better SEO.

- Saving information in AWP contexts (programmatically).




**Passing information (values) between two pages in the URL**

It is possible to pass information from one page to another via the URL. The URL has the following format: "http:\\\\Web server\\...\\mypage.awp?NameParam1=Value1& NameParam2=Value2". 

This method allows a better page SEO because the information passed in the URL is visible and analyzed by the SEO robots.

**Saving information (values) in AWP contexts (programmatically)**. 

You have the ability to store on the server values common to several Active WEBDEV Pages, via the **AWP contexts**. An AWP context is created on disk on the server. This context is available as long as Active WEBDEV Pages are displayed and as long as the timeout of AWP contexts is not exceeded. The timeout of AWP contexts can be defined in the WEBDEV administrator ("Configuration" tab, "Duration of AWP contexts" option).

To manage AWP contexts, you must use WLanguage functions such as [DeclareAWPContext](../WDLang2/3058028.md), [FreeAWPContext](../WDLang2/1000020429.md), etc.
