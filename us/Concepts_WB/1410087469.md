You can choose among several button/link actions, depending on the operation to be performed on the page controls.

The action can be chosen in the control description ("General" tab).<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Op%E9ration%20sur%20les%20champs%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)


Let's see some examples of "standard" uses of buttons/links in a page:

- **Send data of the current page to the server to be processed**
	Example: Registration form: the link is used to check the validity of the information entered and to display a confirmation page.
	To perform this type of process, use a link with the action "Send values to the server". The page data is sent to the server in order to be processed.




- **Perform a process on the server, without retrieving the data of the current page**
	Example: Menu page with buttons: each button opens a page of the site.
	To perform this type of process, use a button with the action "Do not send anything to the server".




- **Perform a process in browser code**
	Example: Perform a simple calculation locally, an input check, ...
	To perform this type of process, use a button with the action "Do not send anything to the server".




- **Display a page external to the WEBDEV site**
	Example: Launch a search engine site via a button.
	To perform this type of process, use a button with the action "Do not send anything to the server".




- **Reinitialize the page controls**
	Example: Link used to clear the controls in the current page.
	To perform this type of process, use a link with the action "Delete content of the controls in the browser".
