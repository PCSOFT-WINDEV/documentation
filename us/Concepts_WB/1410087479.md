3-tier architecture is an application architecture model.

It consists in dividing an application into 3 tiers:

- Presentation tier: the User Interface,

- Application (or processes) tier: business logic of the application,

- Data tier: to access persistent data.




The objective with this separation is to make each tier independent, in order to facilitate maintenance and future developments of the application. This provides better security because only the Application tier allows access to the database. It also optimizes teamwork and cross-platform development. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=3tiers.gif)
The 3-tier architecture is fully compatible with the development of applications or sites using WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile.
