"Dynamic serving" is a technique where the same address (URL) leads to 2 different pages: a page for PC and a page for mobile.

The page will be displayed based on the device (PC or mobile) that opens it.

It can be used as a complement or alternative to "Responsive Web Design" to make a standard Web site "mobile friendly". With "Dynamic serving", you no longer need to modify the existing pages: simply add mobile-specific pages.

This technique improves SEO (Google).

## Principle
<a name="principle_ELTTEXTE000130"></a>
The site includes 2 sets of pages: PC-specific pages and mobile-specific pages. These pages are associated in groups of 2.

When the page address is typed in the browser, the environment used is automatically detected and the corresponding page (computer or mobile device) is displayed in the browser. The address displayed in the browser does not change: only the content displayed is adapted to the system.

All the links and pages open in the code are automatically redirected to the corresponding page in the current platform.

Remarks:

- The environment is detected based on the Google recommendations: tablets are not considered as mobile devices.

- Google detects that the pages are in "Dynamic serving" mode. Therefore, the different page versions are optimized. If the mobile pages are developed properly, the site is considered as "Mobile friendly".
