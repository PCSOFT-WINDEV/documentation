Looper controls are used to repeat a set of controls in a Web page. Different information can be displayed in each row of the Looper. The records in a database can be displayed on each row.

Looper control in the browser

The characteristics of the controls can be modified in each row of the Looper control: caption, text color, etc.

Controls can be repeated:

- on a column,

- on several columns. In this case, it is referred to as "Horizontal Looper".




When creating a Looper control, you can link it directly to a data file or query. The attributes of the Looper control are automatically defined. No programming is required.
