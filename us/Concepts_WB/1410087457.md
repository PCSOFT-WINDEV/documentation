WEBDEV allows you to manage business rules. A business rule is used to define a specific operating mode or particular process. For example: the calculation of a specific VAT rate, the rules for changing the status of a customer, the formula for calculating shipping costs, a commercial commission, a discount rate, a decay coefficient, etc.

A business rule can be simple or complex.

Business rules can come from:

- specifications (corresponding to requirements).

- suggestions made by users of the application.




During the development, the business rules defined for the project are directly displayed in the "Business rules" pane of the development environment. This pane displays the number of project elements to which the business rules apply and the percentage of rules currently implemented.
