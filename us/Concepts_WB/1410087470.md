The browser's "Back" button allows the Web user to go back to a previously visited page. However, it may not always be a good idea to go back to a page.

For example, in a business site, if the Web user goes back to the order validation page, he may validate his order twice and therefore place 2 orders.

**To prevent from using the browser "Back" button to go back to a page**:

1. Display the page in the WEBDEV page editor.

2. On the "Page" tab, click the dialog box launcher of the "Edit" group (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_regroup.gif) ). The page description window appears.

3. Open the "UI" tab.

4. In the option "Browser "Back" button", select "Forbidden".

5. Validate.
