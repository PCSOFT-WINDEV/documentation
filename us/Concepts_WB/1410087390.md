Hosting companies propose two types of servers for installing your WEBDEV sites:

- **shared server**:  
	server whose resources are shared by several clients (client = hosted company). <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P8-Serveur%20d%E9di%E9%20ou%20mutualis%E9-serveur%20mutualis%E9.gif)

	**Characteristics**:
	The hosting company provides a server to several clients.
	The hosting company:

	- configures the FTP server (required only for FTP deployments).

	- defines the maximum number of connections for all the dynamic sites belonging to the same client (via the WEBDEV account manager).
			The setup and updates of a dynamic or static site can be performed by FTP.




- **dedicated server**: the server is reserved for the client. The hosting company provides the access to Internet (IP address, wire, etc.).
	The computer is either rented by the hosting company, or provided by the client. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P8-Serveur%20d%E9di%E9%20ou%20mutualis%E9-serveur%20d%E9di%E9.gif)

	**Characteristics**:
	The hosting company provides the access to Internet (IP address, wire, etc.). 
	The client must:

	- provide the server (or rent it), 

	- configure the computer (system, etc.), 

	- install the Web server, 

	- install and configure WEBDEV sites (via HTTP, FTP or DVD-ROM).
