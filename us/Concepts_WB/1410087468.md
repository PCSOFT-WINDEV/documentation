The graphic aspect of a Web site is a major element. With WEBDEV, it is very easy to get a good looking site with a professional style at first try. To do so, several tools are available: the skins, the palettes and the preset page templates.

## Skin
<a name="skin_ELTTEXTE000188"></a>
The skin of a site can be selected in the project description window ("Project" tab, "Project" group, "Description"). Skins can be configured in the "Skin" tab. Several skins are provided with WEBDEV.

A skin includes:

- a style sheet containing WEBDEV styles.

- an image directory.

- a default color palette.

- a set of reports used as base to build the new project reports.




The skins can be swapped at any time to modify the graphic aspect of a site. When changing skin, WEBDEV automatically adapts the visual aspect of the site controls.

The skin of a page can be defined at three different levels (in descending order of priority):

- In the project.

- In the page template from which the page inherits the properties.

- In the page itself.




The general skin must be defined at project level. If a set of pages (e.g., "Promotion" pages of an e-commerce site) must use a specific skin, you can redefine the project skin as a page template . If a particular page must have a different skin, you can choose the skin only for that page.

## Color palettes
<a name="color_palettes_ELTTEXTE000212"></a>
Color palettes define a set of colors that are available in all the color pickers of the project. The color palettes are an easy way to customize the visual aspect of a site.

These colors are also applied to the styles defined in the project skin in order to easily change the visual aspect of a project.

The color palette of a page can be defined at three different levels (in descending order of priority):

- In the project.

- In the page template from which the page inherits the properties.

- In the page itself.




The general palette must be defined at project level. If a set of pages (e.g., "Management" pages of a site) must use a specific palette, you can redefine the project palette as a page template. Finally, if a specific page must have a different palette, you can choose the palette only for that page.

## Preset page templates
<a name="preset_page_templates_ELTTEXTE000236"></a>
Preset page templates provide page structures that correspond to a wide variety of sites and promote reusability and graphic harmony between projects.

Several templates are provided with WEBDEV.

You can add the same preset template to a project multiple times to use it with different skins or color palettes.

Once it is added to the project, the preset template can be opened in the editor and modified like any other page template.

A preset page template can also be used as base template for creating another page template.
