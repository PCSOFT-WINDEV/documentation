The Hosting Control Center, which is mainly intended for hosting companies and Webmasters, helps you host WEBDEV sites.

The Control Center manages the WEBDEV accounts as well as the account for the Web server and the rights for the operating system.

A default choice is proposed: it allows you to easily install a server, without specific knowledge.

The configuration of the following elements is centralized:

- Windows accounts,

- Groups of FTP users,

- Groups of WEBDEV clients,

- Home Directory,

- FTP alias,

- WEBDEV accounts,

- Data directories,

- Virtual Web sites, ...




The WEBDEV Hosting Control Center operates in the Windows environment with the IIS Web server (Internet Information Server, all versions from version 5).
