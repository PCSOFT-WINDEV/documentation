An external component is a set of WEBDEV elements: pages, reports, analysis, etc. This set of elements performs a specific operation. For example, an external component can correspond to one of the following actions:

- Sending faxes,

- Sending emails,

- ...




A WEBDEV external component can be redistributed to other WEBDEV developers (free or not). Developers will be able to easily integrate the feature included in the external component into their websites without having access to the corresponding source code (if it has not been distributed with the component). The external component will be included in the site and distributed along with it.
