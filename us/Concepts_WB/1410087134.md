Create reports in the report editor to print the documents generated by your site (invoices, quotes, etc).

To print reports regardless of the user's computer configuration, it is recommended to set at least two print modes:

- ***Print to HTML***: The report is displayed in a new page of the site. The report can be printed via the browser "Print" button. No specific software is required.

- ***Print to PDF***: This print mode requires Acrobat Reader (or a similar program) on the user's computer. The print job is started from this program.
