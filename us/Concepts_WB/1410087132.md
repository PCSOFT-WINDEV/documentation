A report provides a custom view of data: data entered in the database, data in a text file, data from a Table control, etc.

The principle for creating a report is as follows:

- the data to be printed comes from a data source (data file described in an analysis, HFSQL view, query, memory area or text file).

- the report groups, sorts and formats the data.




The created report can be:

- printed on the printer of the server (for an Intranet site).

- displayed in the user's browser (HTML, PDF, etc.).

- sent to the user by email (PDF).
