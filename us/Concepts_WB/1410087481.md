The debugger can always be used when running a test from the editor. Simply set a breakpoint at the desired location to debug the site step by step.

The different types of tests available from the editor are as follows:

- ***"Go" on page***:
	The page in the editor can be tested via ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_Go%20Page_bl.gif) in the quick access buttons of WEBDEV.




- ***"Go" on project***:
	The project test on the development computer can be run via:

	- ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_GO_Projet_WB_bl.gif)found in the quick access buttons of WEBDEV, 

	- on the "Project" tab, in the "Test mode" group, expand "Test mode" and select "Debug project".







- ***The deployed project***:
	The deployed project can be debugged. This feature is very useful to reproduce a problem that occurs under specific conditions.
	To start the deployed project, on the "Project" tab, in the "Test mode" group, expand "Test mode" and select "Connect to a site and debug the connection".
	**Remark**: This option can be used with a development server or with a deployment server. The server must be configured to allow the remote debugging.




- ***The deployed project being used***:
	The deployed project can be debugged while being used. This feature is very useful to reproduce a problem that occurs under specific conditions. Most common case: a problem occurs while you are using the site: you can start the debugger immediately by setting a breakpoint in the code of your project.
	To use a session of deployed project, go to the "Project" tab, "Test mode" group, expand "Test mode" and select "Debug an existing connection".
	**Remark**: This option can be used with a development server or with a deployment server. The server must be configured to allow the remote debugging.
