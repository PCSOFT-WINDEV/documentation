Different types of pages can be used in the sites created with WEBDEV:

- **Static pages**. This type of page is used to display fixed data.

- **Dynamic WEBDEV pages in Session mode**. These pages are used to dynamically display the information found in a database. The content of the page depends on the displayed record.  When a dynamic page in session mode is displayed, the associated page context is automatically created on the server. This page context mainly contains the global variables and the variables for positioning in the data files.

- **Dynamic Active WEBDEV Pages (AWP)**. These pages are used to dynamically display the data found in a database. The content of the page depends on the displayed record.
	An Active WEBDEV Page is a dynamic WEBDEV page without a context persisting on the server. The Active WEBDEV Page context is temporary. It is created in a temporary session. 

- **Dynamic PHP pages**. These pages are used to dynamically display the data found in a database. These pages can only be used in a PHP site.
