WEBDEV includes a Project Monitoring Center to manage development projects. The Project Monitoring Center allows you to:

- Manage project requirements,

- Monitor the progress of a project (schedule tasks),

- Manage bugs and changes made to a project.




The Project Monitoring Center uses an HFSQL Classic or Client/Server database: the Control Center database. This database is shared between different tools available in WEBDEV: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P3-Les%20centres%20de%20controle.gif)


Remark: When installing WEBDEV, the setup program prompts you to:

- create the database of the Control Centers. This database will be automatically created in HFSQL Classic format in the specified directory.

- share an existing database of the Control Centers.
