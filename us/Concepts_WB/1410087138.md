The page layout is one of the most important elements when building a site. 

A site can have one of the following page layouts:

- **site centered**:
	Pages are centered in the browser. If the resolution on the user's computer is higher than the site's optimal resolution, white margins will appear on both sides of the page. The content of the site is centered. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P1_Principe%20d'une%20page%20statique%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif&type=thumb)


- **site anchored horizontally**:
	Page content takes up all available space in the browser.

**Remarks**: 

- The type of layout is defined in the page anchoring options ("Anchor" option in the context menu of the page). 

- The type of layout (centered or anchored horizontally) set on a page template will be automatically used on the pages associated with the template.
