WEBDEV covers the entire site development life cycle:<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2-cycle%20de%20developpement%20d'un%20site.gif)
**Details of the different steps**:

**Design phase**: A site can be designed from specific requirements, from UML modeling of processes or even from existing data files.

**Development phase**: The project and the analysis are created via specific wizards. The site can be developed in RAD (Rapid Application Development) mode, with automatic code and interface generation; or it can result from manually creating multiple project elements.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2-cycle%20de%20developpement%20d'un%20site-2.gif)
**Testing and generation phase**: WEBDEV includes several automated test tools to guarantee application reliability and make sure there are no regressions during the development steps.

**Deployment phase**: A dynamic WEBDEV site (in Session or AWP mode) is deployed on a WEBDEV Application Server. Once the site is deployed, you can test it before making it accessible to users.
