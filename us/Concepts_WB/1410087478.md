Universal replication allows updating databases of similar or different formats (HFSQL Classic, Oracle, SQL Server, etc.). For example, you can synchronize an HFSQL Classic database with an Oracle database.

Universal replication uses a centralized model: all databases are synchronized with a master database. Then, the master database reflect the changes in the other databases.

The synchronization can be adapted to special cases. For example, you can retrieve the records regarding a specific product, or the records created on a specific date, manage conflicts, etc.

These adaptations must be done through programming with [HRplFilterProcedure](../WDLang4/3044300.md).
