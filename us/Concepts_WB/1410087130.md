Uploading consists in sending one or more files from the user's computer to the server.

**A simple example: Create a contact in a directory**.

The user wants to associate a photo with the contact form. This photo is stored on the hard disk of the computer.

The UPLOAD control allows the user to select the image via a "Select a file" button.

When the form is validated, the selected image file is sent to the server and copied to the hard disk of the server ([UploadCopyFile](../WDLang2/3012023.md)).
Then, the image will be displayed in the contact form.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2-upload%20envoi%20de%20fichiers%20vers%20le%20serveur.gif)


Caution: The appearance of the "Select a file" button (shape, color or text) is defined by the browser and cannot usually be customized.

**Remark**: WEBDEV also includes an upload Smart control. This control supports progress bars, multiple file selection, etc.
