The table below presents the benefits and drawbacks of different types of servers.

Regardless of the type of server, a deployment license is required for each server.

Each server hosts one or more dynamic WEBDEV sites (in Session or AWP mode).

| Server | Benefits / Drawbacks | When to use <br>this server? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shared | Main benefits:<br><br>- Lower cost.<br><br>- Server managed by the hosting company.<br><br><br><br><br>Main drawbacks:<br><br>- Memory resources shared by all the sites found on the server.<br><br>- If a site is locked, all the sites found on the server are locked.<br><br>- Stand-alone executables can rarely be used.<br><br>- Non-secured access to data: <br>	Unauthorized people can access the data: the hosting company and possibly other clients if the server is not configured properly. <br>	Tip: encrypt the data files to avoid any unauthorized use.<br><br><br> | A shared server is recommended for:<br><br>- **sites with few hits** (up to 20 or 30 simultaneous connections)<br><br>- sites requiring little memory (no large calculations performed on the server),<br><br>- Sites in startup phase.<br><br><br> |
| Dedicated | Main benefits:<br><br>- The server resources are available for the sites installed on this computer.<br><br>- Custom management of data download: <br><br>	- replication by emails, <br><br>	- WDREPLIC, <br><br>	- copy of files by FTP. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Main drawbacks:<br><br>- High cost.<br><br>- Server entirely managed by the client in most cases.<br><br><br> | A dedicated server is recommended for:<br><br>- **sites with many hits**,<br><br>- sites that require a lot of disk space and memory,<br><br>- sites that manage sensitive data,<br><br>- dynamic sites.<br><br><br> |
