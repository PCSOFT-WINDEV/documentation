HFSQL Client/Server is a powerful system for managing relational databases (RDBMS) in Client/Server mode.

The characteristics of the Client/Server mode are as follows:

- An HFSQL Client/Server site is run on different client computers. A session is started on the Web server for each site run.

- The data files are located on a server (HFSQL server). Only the server physically accesses the data files.

- All processes (queries, read from and write records to a data file, etc.) are performed on the server.
