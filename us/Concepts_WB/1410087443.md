New projects are often cross-platform.

For example, for an ERP system on Windows, it is very likely that beside the main application, there will be sales agents equipped with PDAs or smartphones, stores with mobile devices for inventory management, and Intranet and Internet sites.

**All elements, excluding the UI (pages and windows), are 100% compatible and can be shared between WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile projects**.

It is thus possible to share sets of procedures or classes, for example, between several projects.

A project can be opened in any IDE regardless of the one that was used to create it.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2_Format_compatible%20WB%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)
When you open a project in a different IDE, a wizard appears, allowing you to create a project configuration specific to the IDE used.

For example, if you open a WINDEV project in WEBDEV, you will be able to create a project configuration named "Site", to group all the elements required by the WEBDEV site.

You can also view the elements of each platform from each environment. A project in WEBDEV displays the thumbnails of WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile windows, for example. Clicking a WINDEV window from the WEBDEV project editor opens the WINDEV window (WINDEV must be installed on the computer).
