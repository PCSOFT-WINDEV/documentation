The RAD (Rapid Application Development) is used to create pages from:

- the analysis linked to the project,

- standard or custom RAD patterns,

- skin templates.




**In RAD generation** the generated pages contain all the code necessary for their operation. These pages can be tested immediately with the data from the development computer.
