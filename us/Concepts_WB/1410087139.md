To attract users to your site they must be able to find it. To do so, your site must come up when the user enters keywords that match your site in a search engine.

To improve your site's SEO, WEBDEV includes:

- an SEO wizard. This wizard lists all the optimizations that can be performed to improve your site's SEO. To start the wizard, on the "Project" tab, in the "Web" group, expand "SEO" and select "SEO wizard".

- the possibility to enter a description and keywords for each page of the site.




You can create a new page and define it as the home page when you develop your project.

**Remark**: SEO is a technique whose rules are defined by search engines (Google, Bing, etc.). These rules are not always explicit and are constantly evolving. Don't hesitate to read books or to visit sites dedicated to this topic.
