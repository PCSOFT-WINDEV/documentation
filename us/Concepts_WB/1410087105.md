A dynamic site is used to display pages whose content changes. In most cases, the content of these pages is linked to a database.

A dynamic site can be used to manage real-time travel bookings for example. These bookings are saved in a data file and they can be displayed at any time.

WEBDEV proposes two types of dynamic sites:

- **dynamic WEBDEV site (in Session or AWP mode)**. This type of site requires a WEBDEV Application Server on the server. It can be used to handle several databases.

- **dynamic PHP site**. This type of site requires a PHP engine on the server. This type of site is recommended for the dynamic sites hosted by a public hosting company.
