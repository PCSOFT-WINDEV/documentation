Your dynamic WEBDEV site (in Session or AWP mode) can be accessed as soon as it is on-lined. On-lining a WEBDEV site consists in activating the site.

Several methods can be used to activate a WEBDEV site:

- when performing the setup by HTTP: a check box can be used to automatically activate the site after being installed.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P7_D%E9ploiement%20-%20HC%20N%B0008%202.gif&type=thumb)





- with the remote administrator.

- with the WEBDEV administrator found on the deployment computer ("Locked" option in the "Sites" tab).<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P7_Administrateur%20WB%20-%20HC%20N%B0002%202.gif&type=thumb)
