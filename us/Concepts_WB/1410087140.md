## SEO principles
<a name="seo_principles_ELTTEXTE000252"></a>
In order for your WEBDEV site to be visited, Internet users must be able to find it. To do so, your site must come up when the user enters keywords that match your site in a search engine.

### Improving the SEO of a WEBDEV site
<a name="improving_the_seo_webdev_site_ELTPARAGRAPHE000017"></a>

To improve the SEO of your pages, we recommend that you use Active WEBDEV Pages.

To optimize a site in Session mode, use:

- a home page.

- a section of the site in static mode. The static site will be used for the SEO and will start the site in Session mode.

- a section of the site in AWP mode. The AWP site will be used for the SEO and will start the site in Session mode.


Remark: In AWP, to pass parameters between your pages, we advise you to pass parameters via the URL rather than using AWP contexts. The URL content can be optimized whereas AWP contexts cannot.

### Available tools
<a name="available_tools_ELTPARAGRAPHE000034"></a>

To help you, WEBDEV offers:

- ***An SEO of each static and Active WEBDEV Page***: for each page, it is possible to define a description and a set of keywords. These keywords will allow users to access the page directly. You can also choose not to optimize a page.

- ***A search engine optimization wizard***, which indicates the improvements that can be made on each page for SEO purposes.

- The possibility to ***include or use a specific page as home page***. This solution is used, for example, to optimize pages in Session mode, by associating keywords to the home page. This home page contains all the keywords that will allow users to find your site.

## Optimizing a page and entering its keywords
<a name="optimizing_page_and_entering_its_keywords_ELTTEXTE000312"></a>
To optimize a static or Active WEBDEV Page of your site:

1. Open the page description window.

2. In the "Details" tab, a specific section allows you to configure the page SEO. In this area, click "Edit expressions and keywords".

3. ***In the "Description" tab of the SEO window***, enter the description of the page. In most cases, this description appears when displaying the result of a search performed by a search engine. Tips:

	- Use short sentences, limit the number of words (up to 200 characters)

	- This description must entice Internet users to visit the page.
			**Remark**: This description can be modified dynamically using the [Description](../Proprietes/1000017164.md) property.




4. ***In the "Keyword" tab of the SEO window***, enter the keywords associated with the page. These keywords (or expressions) will be used to optimize the page: if the user enters one of these keywords, the search engine will propose the corresponding page. The keywords are typed as follows: type the first keyword and press Enter to type the next one.
	Tips:

	- The first three keywords are the most important ones. Use common keywords and pertinent keywords.

	- The keywords must not be repeated.

	- Use variations (singular/plural, noun/verb, etc.).


 **Remark**: These keywords can be dynamically modified using the [Keywords](../Proprietes/1000017163.md) property.

5. Validate the page SEO and description windows.

## Using the SEO wizard
<a name="using_the_seo_wizard_ELTTEXTE000336"></a>
To help you improve the SEO of your sites and pages, WEBDEV proposes an SEO wizard. This wizard can be used for a specific page or for all the pages of your project. This wizard analyzes the composition of the site pages and indicates the possible changes to improve the ranking of the pages in the search engines.

Examples of optimizations detected by the wizard:

- The page title must be specified.

- At least three keywords must be specified for the page.

- The page description must be specified.

- The alternative text must be typed for all controls that propose it (by using the keywords defined for the page if possible)...




**To start the page SEO wizard**:

1. Open the desired page in the editor.

2. On the "Page" tab, in the "SEO" group, click "Optimize". 

3. The SEO wizard starts. Double-click a suggestion to perform the corresponding optimization. The "Refresh" button is used to update the list of suggestions.




**To start the SEO wizard for all the pages of a site**:

1. On the "Project" tab, in the "Web" group, expand "SEO" and select "SEO wizard".

2. The SEO wizard starts. Double-click a suggestion to perform the corresponding optimization. The "Refresh" button is used to update the list of suggestions. The results can be sorted by page or by type of advice.

## Registering your site in search engines
<a name="registering_your_site_search_engines_ELTTEXTE000360"></a>
The SEO of a site is made on the search engines directly.

**Remark**: Sometimes, the SEO of a site implies certain fees.

Two types of search engines are available:

- **"Automatic" search engines**:
	These search engines are based on automatic programs for analyzing the content.
	**How can I get my site optimized**?
	An "Optimize your site" link is often available for this type of search engine. Simply specify the address of the site and the email of the Webmaster. The site will then be automatically analyzed (analysis based on the keywords and contents of your site) and optimized.

- **"Directory" search engines**:
	These search engines optimize sites that have been previously checked by human beings.
	**How can I get my site optimized**?
	An "Optimize your site" link is often available for this type of search engine. 
	In most cases, the SEO procedure is as follows: 

	1. Choosing a category for the site (leisure, culture, etc.). 

	2. Filling out a questionnaire about the site to optimize: Internet address of the site, email of the WebMaster, description of the site, etc.

	3. Once your questionnaire has been sent, your site will be evaluated by a person from the company that manages the directory. This person will list your site if they find its content interesting.
