Two click codes are available for buttons/links:

- **a browser click code**, which can be written in WLanguage (or JavaScript) in the code editor. This code is included in the HTML page and is executed on the user's computer.

- ** a server click code**, which can be written in WLanguage (only in dynamic pages). This code is executed on the server.

The table below presents the different codes run (according to the type of button/link) and the associated action.

The appearance and target of the button/link do not affect the order in which the codes are executed.

Tip: Think as the user would to understand and remember the order in which the server and browser codes are executed: the user clicks the button in the browser, therefore the browser click must be executed first.
