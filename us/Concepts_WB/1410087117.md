There are many options to easily edit pages in zoning mode: you just need to split the page into different "areas" using the "Pencil" tool. These areas are automatically configured and allow you to define the page architecture: header, footer, etc.

These areas can be easily handled in the editor: when you increase the header height, the page body adapts automatically. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2_Edition%20d'une%20page%20en%20mode%20zoning%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif&type=thumb)


When the page is edited, the position and anchors of the controls in the different areas do not change. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2_Edition%20d'une%20page%20en%20mode%20zoning%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif&type=thumb)


You can associate HTML 5 text-level semantics to each area: this improves SEO in some cases.
