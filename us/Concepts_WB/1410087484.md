## The different types of deployment
<a name="the_different_types_deployment_ELTTEXTE000182"></a>
WEBDEV offers three methods for deploying a dynamic site (Session site or AWP):

- ***deployment by physical media (CD-ROM, etc.)*** of the WEBDEV site, with creation of a setup version supplied on CD-ROM to the hosting company. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P7-D%E9ploiement%20d'un%20site%20dynamique%20WebDev.gif)
**Remark**: a WEBDEV Application Server can be included in the setup supplied by physical media.

- ***remote deployment directly from the development computer (by file transfer via Internet in HTTP mode)***. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P7-D%E9ploiement%20d'un%20site%20dynamique%20WebDev-%E0%20distance%20depuis%20le%20poste%20de%20developpement.gif)
**Remark**: It is also possible to perform a deployment by file transmission in FTP mode. In this case, the hosting company must configure an FTP server.

- ***remote deployment from a management computer (file transfer through Internet, FTP)***<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P7-D%E9ploiement%20d'un%20site%20dynamique%20WebDev-%E0%20distance%20depuis%20un%20poste%20d'administration.gif)
**Note**: It is also possible to perform this deployment by file transmission in FTP mode. In this case, an FTP server must be configured on the Web server.

## Choosing a deployment method
<a name="choosing_deployment_method_ELTTEXTE000206"></a>
The choice of deployment method mainly depends on the constraints imposed by the hosting company and on the location of deployment server (remote or local).

**The setup via physical media is recommended** if the Web server can be easily accessed (the Web server and the development team are located in the same premises, for example).

**The remote setup (by HTTP) from the development computer is recommended** if the deployment computer cannot be easily accessed.
Before performing a remote setup, the hosting company must configure the WEBDEV account manager.

**The remote setup (by HTTP) from a management computer is recommended** if the characteristics of the server are not known by the developer when creating the setup program. In this case, the setup program is called a "Package".

If a site is intended for several clients, you have the ability to create a single package and to distribute it to all the relevant clients.

The server settings (address, etc.) are specified only when the package is run on the management computer.

## Deployment via physical media: necessary information
<a name="deployment_via_physical_media_necessary_information_ELTTEXTE000230"></a>
When deploying by physical media, the information about the setup and the site settings is both in the setup creation wizard and in the setup wizard.

**When preparing the setup**, you must supply:

- the installation directory,

- the files to install,

- the directory for generating the setup.




**During the setup**, you must supply:

- the directory of data files,

- the directory of site files.




**After setup**, the characteristics of the site (connection timeout, number of connections, etc.) must be configured in the WEBDEV administrator (deployment version).

## Deployment via HTTP directly from the development computer: necessary information
<a name="deployment_via_http_directly_from_the_development_computer_necessary_information_ELTTEXTE000254"></a>
No setup can be run without this information. Ask the provider to get this information.

**Before performing an HTTP deployment directly from the development computer**, the host company must communicate the following information to the developer:

- Name of the Web server where the setup will be performed (or its IP address).

- Username and associated password defined in the WEBDEV account manager.

- The OS account used to run WEBDEV sites (it is associated with the WEBDEV account in the account manager). 




**When deploying by HTTP**, the developer must specify in the wizard:

- the information provided by the hosting company,

- the files to install,

- the name of the subdirectory of data files,

- the different parameters for connecting to the site.




**Remarks**:

- A delayed setup can be performed at the specified date and time.

- The setup and the update by HTTP are secured by password and data encryption.

## Deployment via HTTP directly from a management computer: necessary information
<a name="deployment_via_http_directly_from_management_computer_necessary_information_ELTTEXTE000278"></a>
**When creating the setup program**, no specific information is required.

**When running the setup program of the site** (from a management computer), the hosting company will have to specify:

- Name of Web server where the setup will be performed (or its IP address).

- Username and associated password defined in the WEBDEV account manager.

- The OS account used to run WEBDEV sites (it is associated with the WEBDEV account in the account manager). 




**Remarks**:

- A delayed setup can be performed at the specified date and time.

- The setup and the update by HTTP are secured by password and data encryption.
