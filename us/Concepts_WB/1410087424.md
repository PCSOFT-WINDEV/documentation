A WEBDEV HFSQL application can be in Classic mode (HFSQL Classic) or in Client/Server mode.

The characteristics of the Classic mode are as follows:

- A site that uses HFSQL Classic is run on different browsers. A session is started on the server for each site run.

- The data files are located in a directory (on the Web server or on another computer) that can be accessed by the sessions of the WEBDEV sites. Each session physically accesses the data files.

- The processes (queries, read or add records in a data file, etc.) are performed by each session.
