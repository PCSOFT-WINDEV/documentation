WEBDEV is a powerful web-focused Integrated Development Environment that includes all the tools required for developing and maintaining websites. 

**To quickly and efficiently learn how to use WEBDEV, we recommend that you proceed in the following order**:

| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CERCLE1.gif) | Read the "Concepts" (online or on physical documentation).<br> <br>This guide presents the main concepts required to create a WEBDEV site. Some concepts are followed by a "Practical" section that presents some features of the editor. |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CERCLE2.gif) | "Tutorial" (online tutorial + exercises).<br>The tutorial provides a first "hands-on" approach to WEBDEV. It allows you to become familiar with the main editors of WEBDEV. |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CERCLE3.gif) | Test of examples.<br>Try the different examples provided with WEBDEV in the fields that interest you most (e-commerce, directory, scheduling, etc.). |


The online help, available at [http://doc.windev.com](http://doc.windev.com) or installed with WEBDEV, allows you to quickly find the syntax of a WLanguage function, get help about the interface, etc. For each programming theme, you will find a description of the associated feature and the list of the corresponding WLanguage functions.



**We hope you enjoy getting started with WEBDEV.**
