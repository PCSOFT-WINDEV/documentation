## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000180"></a>
For compatibility with the earlier versions of the Native SQL Server Connector (also called Native SQL Server Access), the connection can still be configured in WDSQSINS (supplied with the Native SQL Server Connector).

This software is supplied: 

- in 32-bit: WDSQSINS.EXE

- in 64-bit: WDSQSINS64.EXE




**Reminder**: The connection settings via WDSQSINS must be defined only once.

This page presents:

- [the settings of a connection](#NOTE2_1).

- [the definition of connection options](#NOTE3_1).

- [the test of a connection](#NOTE4_1).

## Configuring a connection
<a name="configuring_connection_ELTTEXTE000204"></a>
To configure the connection:

1. Start WDSQSINS.EXE.

2. In the window that is opened (used to list the existing connections), click the "Add" button to create a new connection. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Parametrage_1.gif)


3. Specify the connection settings: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Connexion_1.gif)





- Choose the name of the data source. This name will be passed as a parameter to [SQLConnect](../WDLang4/3072005.md) to connect to the database. If the connection was defined in the data model editor of WINDEV or WEBDEV, specify the name of the corresponding connection.

- Add a description caption.

- Specify a connection string. **The connection string** is the name of the server where SQL Server is installed. It is used to find the database. Example of connection string: CSNT

- Specify whether the format of the dates must remain 5.5-compatible. 
	Reminder: Between version 5.5 and version 5.5B, the date format was modified. If you check the box, you will restore the date format returned before version 5.5B (see the paragraph below).

- Specify the options to use:

	- **Use a count(\*) query with SQLFirst**: During a browse performed by [SQLFirst](../WDLang4/3072017.md), [SQLInfo](../WDLang4/3072028.md) fills the *SQL.NbLine* variable (number of result rows). 
			By default, a **COUNT** query is generated to fill this variable ("Use a count(\*) query with SQLFirst" is checked). This query increases the number of exchanges on the network but it optimizes the execution of [SQLFirst](../WDLang4/3072017.md). 
			To avoid increasing the number of exchanges on the network, uncheck "Use a count(\*) query with SQLFirst". In this case, the execution of [SQLFirst](../WDLang4/3072017.md) may be slowed down.

	- **SET ANSI_NULLS**: Opens the connection in 'SET ANSI_NULLS ON' mode'. If this option is not checked, the default connection settings are used (settings defined on the server). This option is required to access a remote server (called linked server).

	- **SET ANSI_WARNINGS**: Opens the connection in 'SET ANSI_WARNINGS ON' mode'. If this option is not checked, the default connection settings are used (settings defined on the server). This option is required to access a remote server (called linked server).




- The connection is added to the list once the parameters are validated.

### Remarks
<a name="remarks_ELTPARAGRAPHE000082"></a>

- The information about the settings is stored in the **Wdsqsins.ini** file in the Windows directory ("C:\\Windows\\" or "C:\\Users\\LOGIN\\AppData\\Local\\VirtualStore\\Windows\\" in Windows Vista/7).

- WDSQL is used to check whether the connection to the database is correct.

### Date format returned by the native SQL Server driver
<a name="date_format_returned_the_native_sql_server_driver_ELTPARAGRAPHE000090"></a>

**In version 5.5**: The date returned by the native SQL Server driver when reading a Date item was: JJ-MM-AAAA

**In version 5.5B**: The date returned by the native SQL Server driver when reading a Date item is now: YYYYMMDD.

**Reasons behind this modification**: Harmonizes the management of dates in WINDEV. Simplifies the assignment of the date read by the SQL Server driver in a WINDEV control of DATE type. No specific process is required to convert the date into a format recognized by WINDEV.

**How to keep the former operating mode?**
Configure the date format in WDSQSINS: check "Return the dates in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format (for SQLCol and SQLGetCol) " when describing the database used.

**Reminder**: When writing in a database via the native SQL Server driver, use the standard ODBC format {d 'YYYY-MM-DD'} (with a space between d and ' ). The driver automatically converts the date into the format used by the database.

Example:


```sql
INSERT INTO TABLE(DATE) VALUES ({d '1999-12-25'})
```

### Options for the locks
<a name="options_for_the_locks_ELTPARAGRAPHE000113"></a>

**SQLLock** expects two parameters:

- the timeout: the timeout during the call to **SQLLock** can be infinite or not (deadlock). The timeout is set to 1 minute by default, but it can be modified.

- the lock mode. See the documentation about the server for more details.

## Connection test
<a name="connection_test_ELTTEXTE000264"></a>
To run the test of a connection from WDSQSINS:

1. Select the connection whose test must be run.

2. Click the "Test" button.

3. Specify the name and password of the user.

4. Click "Test connection". The status report is displayed. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=test_1.gif)
