## Specific features of the Native SQL Server Connector
<a name="specific_features_the_native_sql_server_connector_ELTTEXTE000309"></a>


### Table control based on a data file loaded in memory
<a name="table_control_based_data_file_loaded_memory_ELTPARAGRAPHE000018"></a>

The new records added into a Table control based on a data file loaded in memory cannot be modified straightaway. To modify these new records directly in the Table control, you must use [TableDisplay](../WDLang1/3074003.md) with the *taInit* constant after the additions.
<a name="NOTE2_2"></a>


### Locking a data file (table) in a transaction
<a name="locking_data_file_table_transaction_ELTPARAGRAPHE000028"></a>

[HLockFile](../WDLang4/3044153.md) starts a transaction and locks the table in Exclusive mode. [HUnlockFile](../WDLang4/3044160.md) validates the transaction and unlocks the table.
<a name="NOTE2_3"></a>


### Record number
<a name="record_number_ELTPARAGRAPHE000040"></a>

You cannot specify a record number other than zero in [HWrite](../WDLang4/3044092.md) and [HRead](../WDLang4/3044047.md). "Zero" corresponds to the current record number.

Similarly, [HLockRecNum](../WDLang4/3044152.md) and [HUnlockRecNum](../WDLang4/3044194.md) can only be used on the current record.
<a name="NOTE2_4"></a>


### Retrieving the DATETIME types
<a name="retrieving_the_datetime_types_ELTPARAGRAPHE000061"></a>

- The precision of values read and written is limited to the WLanguage precision: the millisecond. 
	**Special case**: The datetime type: The precision is limited by SQLServer to 0.00333 second.

- The new SQLServer 2008 date and time types are supported only from SQLnCLI for SQL Server 2008.. For earlier client layers, these items are considered as "unicode text" items.



<a name="NOTE2_5"></a>


### Analysis options
<a name="analysis_options_ELTPARAGRAPHE000071"></a>

- Whether the "Case sensitive", "Accent sensitive", "Punctuation sensitive" options are checked or not in the data model editor, the search will always be case, accentuation and punctuation sensitive.

- The analysis options regarding the full-text indexes are not supported by the Native Connector.

- The analysis options regarding the partial indexing of text memos are not supported by the Native Connector.



<a name="NOTE2_6"></a>


### Array items
<a name="array_items_ELTPARAGRAPHE000080"></a>

The array items are not supported by the Native Connector. If you are using an array item, only the value of index 1 in the array will be handled by HFSQL functions (read/write).
<a name="NOTE2_7"></a>


### Encryption via SSL
<a name="encryption_via_ssl_ELTPARAGRAPHE000087"></a>

The encryption by SSL (Secure Socket Layer) is not supported in this version.
<a name="NOTE2_8"></a>


### Stored procedures
<a name="stored_procedures_ELTPARAGRAPHE000094"></a>

**Limit**: [HPrepareSQLQuery](../WDLang4/3044119.md) cannot be used to prepare a stored procedure that returns:

- records.

- columns.


You must use [HExecuteSQLQuery](../WDLang4/3044084.md).
<a name="NOTE2_9"></a>


### Default values of items
<a name="default_values_items_ELTPARAGRAPHE000114"></a>

The default values of items are managed by the Native SQL Server Connector. The default values can be: 

- a value, 

- an SQL formula. In this case, the SQL expression must be recognized by the HFSQL engine and by the SQL Server database. 



<a name="NOTE2_10"></a>


### Specific features for the HFSQL functions
<a name="specific_features_for_the_hfsql_functions_ELTPARAGRAPHE000124"></a>

The specific features for using the HFSQL functions with Native SQL Server Connector are as follows:  

| Specific features | Affected functions |
| --- | --- |
| The ***hDistinct*** constant is ignored: all the records (including the duplicates) will be browsed. | [HForward](../WDLang4/3044154.md), [HBackward](../WDLang4/3044126.md)<br>[HReadPrevious](../WDLang4/3044048.md), [HReadNext](../WDLang4/3044037.md)<br>[HPrevious](../WDLang4/3044112.md), [HNext](../WDLang4/3044027.md) |
| **Multi-file query** <br>**HAdd**, **HModify** and **HDelete** are not supported. | [HAdd](../WDLang4/3044147.md), [HModify](../WDLang4/3044042.md)<br>[HDelete](../WDLang4/3044018.md) |
| If a duplicate error occurs on **HModify**, **HRead** (with the *** hCurrentRecNum*** constant) does not read the requested record.<br>This problem will be fixed in a forthcoming version. | [HRead](../WDLang4/3044047.md) |
| The ***hForceIDAuto*** constant is ignored by **HModify**. An "IDENTITY" column cannot be modified in SQL Server. | [HModify](../WDLang4/3044042.md) |
| The lock options of the read functions ([HReadSeek](../WDLang4/3044050.md), etc.) are ignored. | Read functions ([HReadFirst](../WDLang4/3044051.md), etc.) |
| A record locked by [HLockRecNum](../WDLang4/3044152.md) is unlocked when it is read again. | Read functions ([HReadFirst](../WDLang4/3044051.md), etc.) |
| [HCreation](../WDLang4/3044255.md) creates DATE and TIME items if the version of the server and the client layer correspond to SQL Server 2008 (or later). | [HCreation](../WDLang4/3044255.md) |




### Operating problems
<a name="operating_problems_ELTPARAGRAPHE000206"></a>

When using the Native SQL Server Connector, some features such as Drag and Drop, ActiveX or .NET may not work. 
To restore a correct operating mode, the following lines of code should be added into the project initialization code: 


```wl
LoadDLL("ole32")
API("ole32", "CoInitializeEx", 0, 2)
```

<a name="NOTE4_2"></a>


### Special case: SQL Azure
<a name="special_case_sql_azure_ELTPARAGRAPHE000219"></a>

SQL Azure requires the presence of a "clustered index" in the files.

- If the data files are created by [HCreation](../WDLang4/3044255.md), the Native Connector automatically creates the "clustered index" if the description of the data file contains an automatic identifier.

- If you create the data files with SQL queries (or to add a "clustered index" to an existing data file), see the documentation of SQL Azure to find out the syntax to use.



<a name="NOTE4_3"></a>


### Handling calculated items
<a name="handling_calculated_items_ELTPARAGRAPHE000234"></a>

Calculated items can be used in the data files. 

The management of calculated items is available in SQL Server 2005 (or later) with a Native SQL Server Connector via OLE DB or ODBC.
