<a name="description"></a>
The **beaconDetectionInfo** type is used to describe the information relative to a Beacon detected with [BeaconDetectPrecise](../WDLang3/1000023115.md). The characteristics of this Beacon can be read using different WLanguage properties. 

**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

## Example


```wl
// Start detecting tags
BeaconDetectPrecise(group, ProcDetection)
INTERNAL PROCEDURE ProcDetection(arrInfo is array of beaconDetectionInfo)
	nMinDistance is int 
	NearestBeacon is beaconDetectionInfo	
	FOR EACH MyInfo of arrInfo
		IF nMinDistance = 0 _OR_ MyInfo..Distance < nMinDistance
			NearestBeacon = Info
		END
	END
END
```

### Properties specific to beaconDetectionInfo variables
<a name="properties_specific_docparampagetitleshort_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000031"></a>

The following properties can be used to handle a variable of type **beaconDetectionInfo**:

| Property name | Type used | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Distance | Real | Distance (in meters) between the device and the Beacon. The accuracy of the measurement can vary from one device to another but also if the Beacon is in a closed space (e.g., a bag).<br>**This property is read-only**.<br><br> |
| Major | Integer | Major number of the Beacon (integer between 0 and 65535).<br>**This property is read-only**. |
| Minor | Integer | Minor number of the Beacon (integer between 0 and 65535).<br>**This property is read-only**. |
| Proximity | Integer constant | Proximity of the Beacon to the device:<br><br>- *biDistant*: tag beyond 3 meters.<br><br>- *biNear*: Beacon between 0.5 m (1.6 ft) and 3 meters (9.8 ft).<br><br>- *biVeryClose*: Beacon within 0.5 m (1.6 ft).<br><br><br>**This property is read-only**. |
| UUID | Character string | Identifier (or Proximity UUID) associated with the Beacon. In most cases, this identifier corresponds to the organization or to the person to which the Beacon belongs.<br>This identifier includes 32 hexadecimal digits separated into 5 groups. Each group must contain the following number of digits: <br><br>- 1st group: 8 digits.<br><br>- 2nd group: 4 digits.<br><br>- 3rd group: 4 digits.<br><br>- 4th group: 4 digits.<br><br>- 5th group: 12 digits.<br><br><br>The different groups are separated by a dash.  <br><br>Example of valid identifier: f4231ab6-5ef2-6c99-4229-af6c72e0446e<br><br>**This property is read-only**. |

|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [BeaconDetectBackground](../WDLang3/1000023112.md) | Notifies the application when the device enters or leaves the transmission range of a set of Beacons. |
| [BeaconDetectPrecise](../WDLang3/1000023115.md) | Used to find the Beacons near the device. |
| [BeaconStopBackgroundDetection](../WDLang3/1000023114.md) | Stops one or more Beacon detections in the background. |
