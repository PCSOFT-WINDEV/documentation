## Example


```wl
MacAddress is string
// Retrieve the MAC address of Bluetooth device
// The address is stored in a table column
MacAddress = TABLE_Devices.COL_MACAddr[TABLE_Devices]
// OBEX connection
EDT_OBEXID = OBEXConnect(obexBluetooth, MACAddress)
```

## Syntax

`<Result> = OBEXConnect(<Type of Device> [, <Device Address>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**

Connection identifier. This identifier will be used by the OBEX functions. This function returns no error. Indeed, the connection will be actually established when the next OBEX function is used.

**`<Type of Device>: (Integer constant)`**

Type of device used to exchange data:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *obexBluetooth* | Transport of data performed by Bluetooth |
| *obexInfrared* | Transport of data performed by infrared |



**`<Device Address>: (Optional character string)`**

Address of the device used (for a Bluetooth device only): this address corresponds to the MAC address (returned by [BTInfoDevice](../WDLang3/1000017133.md) or [BTListDevice](../WDLang3/1000017132.md)).
