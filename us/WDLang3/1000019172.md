## Overview of IMAP protocol
<a name="overview_imap_protocol_ELTTEXTE000172"></a>
<a name="NOTE1_1"></a>
**The IMAP protocol** is a standard protocol for managing emails. Unlike the POP3 protocol, the principle for using the IMAP protocol consists in leaving the messages on the messaging server in order to read them from several clients. It includes a specified indicator used to find out whether a message was read. Several messaging servers support both the IMAP protocol and the POP3 protocol.

Remarks:

- For more details, see [Overview of POP3/SMTP protocols](../WDLang3/3032031.md).

### Receiving messages by using the IMAP protocol
<a name="receiving_messages_using_the_imap_protocol_ELTPARAGRAPHE000048"></a>

To receive emails by using the IMAP protocol

1. Start an IMAP session by using an [emailIMAPSession](../WDLang3/1000018957.md) variable and [EmailStartSession](../WDLang3/3032028.md). 
	**Example for starting a session by using an emailIMAPSession variable:**
	
	```wl
	// Start the messaging session
	MySession is emailIMAPSession
	MySession.ServerAddress = "pop.mycompany.us"
	MySession.Name = "user"
	MySession.Password = "secret"
	EmailStartSession(MySession)
	```


2. Read the messages on the messaging server:

	- with the [EmailGetAll](../WDLang3/1000018727.md) function.

	- with a loop such as:
			**Example that is using an Email variable:**
			
		```wl
		MyMessage is Email
		EmailReadFirst(MySession,MyMessage)
		WHILE NOT MyMessage.Out
			// Place the process of the message read...
			...
			
			EmailReadNext(MySession, MyMessage)
		END
		```

			**Example that is using the Email structure:**
			
		```wl
		EmailReadFirst(MySession)
		WHILE NOT Email.Out
			// Place the process of the message read...
			...
			
			EmailReadNext(MySession)
		END
		```


	- or with a loop such as (the "NOT READ" keywords are optional and they allow you to browse only the unread messages or all the messages):
			
		```wl
		MyMessage is Email
		FOR EACH MyMessage NOT READ OF MySession
			// Place the process of the message read...
			...
		END
		```





3. Close the IMAP session with [EmailCloseSession](../WDLang3/3032006.md).

### Connection to the service provider
<a name="connection_the_service_provider_ELTPARAGRAPHE000110"></a>

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) An Internet connection is required to manage the emails. Several cases may occur:

- The user uses a modem to connect to Internet: [NetOpenRemoteAccess](../WDLang3/3056026.md) establishes the Internet connection.

- The user uses a direct connection to Internet (cable or ADSL): no specific operation is required.
