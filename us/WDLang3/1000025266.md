## Remarks


### Use conditions
<a name="use_conditions_ELTPARAGRAPHE000069"></a>

The dark theme must have been enabled in the application in order to use **ChangeTheme**: 

1. Open the project description window: on the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, click "Description". 

2. In the "Style" tab, check "Allow switching to dark theme (automatically or manually via ChangeTheme)".

3. Validate.


If the dark theme has not been allowed, **ChangeTheme** returns an error.  

For more details, see [Dark theme management](../WDLang3/1000025338.md). 


### Operation and special cases
<a name="operation_and_special_cases_ELTPARAGRAPHE000105"></a>

- The automatic mode is used by default.

- If the selected theme corresponds to the current theme, **ChangeTheme** has no effect.

- When **ChangeTheme** is used, the theme is changed in all the windows of the application (except in those for which the option "Do not apply dark theme" is checked in the "Style" tab of the description window.

- Windows opened next will use the theme specified with **ChangeTheme**.
