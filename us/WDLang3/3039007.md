**Remark**: To stop receiving or broadcasting a stream without dissociating this stream from a Conference control, use [StreamStop](../WDLang3/3039002.md).

## Syntax

`StreamDisconnect(<Stream identifier>)`
---

**`<Stream identifier>: (Integer)`**

Identifier of the stream to disconnect. This identifier can be found: 

- in the event "Connection request of new stream" associated with the stream.

- by using the [Value](../Proprietes/2510130.md) property on the stream.

## Remarks


### Disconnecting a stream
<a name="disconnecting_stream_ELTPARAGRAPHE000041"></a>

When a stream is disconnected (by the caller or the called), the "End of connection" event is automatically run. 


### Procedure for stream detection
<a name="procedure_for_stream_detection_ELTPARAGRAPHE000174"></a>

A stream is associated with the event "Connection request of new stream". This event is run when a request to connect to an incoming stream is detected.

This event is run in one of the following cases: 

- if the [Detection](../Proprietes/2510031.md) property applied to the stream is set to <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>.

- if the option "Detection of active incoming streams" has been checked in the stream description window.




**Remark**: This event is run in a specific thread of WLanguage. Therefore, it is subject to limitations specific to the threads. For more details on threads, see [Managing threads with WINDEV](../WDLang1/3077026.md).
