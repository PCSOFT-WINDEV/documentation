Imports the content of an HTML file into an Email variable in order to send it by email. The images found in the HTML file are automatically included in the Email variable. 

The current [Email](../WDLang3/1000018713.md) variable is filled: the **NbAttach**, **Attach**[...] and **HTML** properties are initialized according to the HTML content.
Remark: The images integrated by encoding in the HTML file are processed.

Remark: The HTML content is supported in POP3/SMTP only: this function must be used only if the email is sent in SMTP.

### Operating mode of images and attachments
<a name="operating_mode_images_and_attachments_ELTPARAGRAPHE000254"></a>

If &lt;HTML content to send&gt; refers to images:

- these images are automatically attached to the email in the [Email](../WDLang3/1000018713.md) variable.

- the HTML code of message is modified in order to reference the attachments.




**Caution**: The attachments are "added" to the email. For example, if the **NbAttach** property is set to 2 before the call to the **&lt;Email variable&gt;.ImportHTML** function and if the HTML content references an image, this image will be included in the **Attach[3]** property and **NbAttach** will be set to 3.

The additional attachments must be added before using **&lt;Email variable&gt;.ImportHTML**.

The order in which the attachments are sent is not necessarily respected when the email is received.
The identifier of images is a unique identifier.Remark: When importing into an [Email](../WDLang3/1000018713.md) variable, the images integrated by encoding in the source HTML file are also processed.
