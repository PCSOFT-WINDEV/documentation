Creates a socket. A socket is a communication resource used by applications to communicate from one computer to another regardless of the type of network.

**Remarks**:

- This function must be called on the server used for the communication. If the client computer is using a WINDEV application to connect to this socket, this application will have to use [SocketConnect](../WDLang3/3070016.md).

- **SSL sockets**: To create an SSL socket, use [SocketCreateSSL](../WDLang3/1000017041.md).

- **UDP sockets**: To create a UDP socket, use [SocketCreateUDP](../WDLang3/3070019.md).

## Syntax

`<Result> = SocketCreate(<Socket name> , <Port number> [, <Address>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the function was successful,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. If an error occurs, you can get more details on the error with [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md).




**`<Socket name>: (Character string)`**

Name that will be given to the socket. This name will be used by all socket functions. Caution: the socket name is case sensitive.

**`<Port number>: (Integer)`**

Port number that will be given to the socket. This number must be included between 1 and 65000. This number will be specified when the client computers are connected to the server.
![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) You must be "root" to create a socket on a port less than or equal to 1024 (being "root" means being the user who has all the permissions on the system). 

**`<Address>: (Optional character string)`**

IP address on which the socket must be created on the current computer. If the current computer is associated with several IP addresses (or with several network cards), this parameter enables you to choose the IP address that will be associated with the socket.

This IP address can have the following format:

- IP address in XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX format (125.5.110.100 for example).

- IP address containing the name of the server (www.windev.com for example). This syntax is recommended.




![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) The IP address is also returned by [NetIPAddress](../WDLang3/3056023.md).

## Remarks


### Re-creating a socket
<a name="recreating_socket_ELTPARAGRAPHE000109"></a>

If a socket is not closed properly by [SocketClose](../WDLang3/3070015.md) (restarting the computer for example), re-creating the socket may take quite a long time. Indeed, you will have to wait until the socket is freed by the system.

### Re-using an address that is already used
<a name="reusing_address_that_already_used_ELTPARAGRAPHE000121"></a>

By default, **SocketCreate** allows you to reuse an address already used (by the application itself or by another application). To forbid this operating mode, type the following line of code:


```wl
Socket.Option = SocketNoReuseAddress
```


**Remark**: Therefore, this option allows you to find out whether an address or a port is already used. In this case, **SocketCreate** returns an error.

### Connecting to an infrared port
<a name="connecting_infrared_port_ELTPARAGRAPHE000138"></a>

To connect to a socket that is using an infrared port:

1. Create a socket using the infrared port on the server ([SocketCreateInfrared](../WDLang3/3070012.md) in a WINDEV application).

2. In the client application (WINDEV application), use [SocketConnectInfrared](../WDLang3/3070018.md) to connect to this socket.
