## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000097"></a>
WINDEV allows you to easily manage incoming and outgoing phone calls via the WLanguage phone functions.

These functions allow you to manage a voicemail, an answering machine (or other) directly from a WINDEV application.

### Prerequisite
<a name="prerequisite_ELTPARAGRAPHE000027"></a>

To use the telephony features, you must have:

- a modem.

	- To save and play recordings, this modem must include voice support.

	- To identify the caller, the modem must support Caller ID.




- the Tapi 2.0 or Tapi 3.1 protocol. These technologies can be used on all systems.

### Checking configuration
<a name="checking_configuration_ELTPARAGRAPHE000040"></a>

To check the configuration of your computer, we recommend that you use **WDTelDiagno.exe**, provided with WINDEV. This tool is used to list the available TAPI lines and to specify the line that will be used by default by the telephony functions. This allows you to quickly detect the conflicts that may occur between the different TAPI lines.

**Remark**: The TAPI lines differ from the standard phone lines.

Before using the telephony functions, you can define through programming the TAPI device on which the calls must be detected or dialed. Use the functions:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [tapiCapability](../WDLang3/3076014.md) | Returns the characteristics of a telephony device. |
| [tapiDevice](../WDLang3/3076032.md) | Selects the TAPI device that will be used during the following telephony operations: <br><br>- [tapiDial](../WDLang3/3076013.md),<br><br>- [tapiListen](../WDLang3/3076029.md).<br><br><br> |
| [tapiDeviceList](../WDLang3/3076024.md) | Lists the TAPI 2.0 and TAPI 3.1 compatible devices installed on the current computer. |
