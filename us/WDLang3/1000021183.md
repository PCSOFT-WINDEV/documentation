### Syntax with an httpRequest variable

`<HTTP response> = HTTPSend(<HTTP request>)`
---

**`<HTTP response>: (httpResponse variable)`**

Name of the [httpResponse](../WDLang3/1000021165.md) variable containing the response received from the HTTP server.

**`<HTTP request>: (httpRequest variable)`**

Name of the [httpRequest](../WDLang3/1000021158.md) variable that contains the characteristics of the HTTP request to be sent to the server.


<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Simplified syntax for sending a request 

`<HTTP response> = HTTPSend(<URL>)`
---

**`<HTTP response>: (httpResponse variable)`**

### Asynchronous syntax with an httpRequest variable

`HTTPSend(<HTTP request> , <WLanguage procedure>)`
---

**`<HTTP request>: (httpRequest variable)`**

Name of the [httpRequest](../WDLang3/1000021158.md) variable that contains the characteristics of the HTTP request to be sent to the server.

**`<WLanguage procedure>: (Procedure name)`**

Name of the WLanguage procedure called during the response from the HTTP server. This procedure has the following format: 

```txt
PROCEDURE <Procedure name>(<Response> is httpResponse)
```
where &lt;Response&gt; is an [httpResponse](../WDLang3/1000021165.md) variable containing the response received from the HTTP server.

## Remarks


### Notes
<a name="notes_ELTPARAGRAPHE000128"></a>

- To find out the runtime errors of this function, use [ErrorOccurred](../WDLang1/3087001.md) and [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md).

- If cookies have been implemented for the specified request ([HTTPCookieManage](../WDLang3/1000019218.md)), they are updated in the [httpRequest](../WDLang3/1000021158.md) variable after the call to **HTTPSend**. Therefore, during the next call to **HTTPSend** with this request, the cookies will be taken into account. 

- From version 21, the redirections are automatically taken into account in the HTTP requests. To manually process redirections in HTTP requests, you must use the **IgnoreError** property of the [httpRequest](../WDLang3/1000021158.md) variable with the *httpIgnoreRedirection* constant.

### Security error in a secure transaction
<a name="security_error_secure_transaction_ELTPARAGRAPHE000167"></a>

During a secure transaction, the request may fail due to security errors:

- invalid certificate or certificate coming from an unknown company.

- the site name specified in the certificate does not correspond to a server.

- invalid or expired certificate date.

- redirection to a non-secure server.




These errors are returned by [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md).

If one of these errors occurs, you can re-run the request while ignoring the errors. To do so, simply modify the **IgnoreError** property of the [httpRequest](../WDLang3/1000021158.md) variable:

| Error returned by [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md)<br> (with the *errCode* constant) | Value of the **IgnoreError** property of the [httpRequest](../WDLang3/1000021158.md) variable<br>(these values can be combined) | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *httpErrorInvalidCertificate*<br>Invalid certificate or certificate coming from an unknown company | *httpIgnoreInvalidCertificate* | The certificate is ignored. |
| *httpErrorInvalidCertificateName*<br>The site name specified in the certificate does not correspond to a server | *httpIgnoreInvalidCertificateName* | The site name specified in the certificate is ignored. |
| *httpErrorExpiredCertificate*<br>Invalid or expired certificate date | *httpIgnoreExpiredCertificate* | The certificate date is ignored |
| *httpErrorRedirectToHTTP*<br>Redirection to a non-secure server | *httpIgnoreRedirectToHTTP* | The redirection to a non-secure server is allowed. |
| *httpIgnoreRedirectToHTTPS*<br>Redirection to a secure server | *httpIgnoreRedirectToHTTPS* | The redirection to a secure server is allowed. |
|   | *httpIgnoreRevocation* | The certificate found in the list of revoked certificates is not checked. |

Remarks: 

- When the HTTP queries are run in several threads, the **HTTP.IgnoreError** variable has a specific value for each thread.
