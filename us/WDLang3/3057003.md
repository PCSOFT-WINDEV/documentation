Pastes the content of Windows clipboard into an OLE control.

**Remark**: If the clipboard content was created on an OLE server, this server is automatically associated with the object, otherwise the object will not be pasted. Depending on the server that created the OLE object, the object can be displayed in the control as:

- its bitmap representation (example of image created with Paint Brush),

- its vector representation (example of worksheet created by Excel),

- the icon representing the server (icon created by WinWord),

- text.
