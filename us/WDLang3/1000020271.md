## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000130"></a>
In your mobile applications, you have the ability to directly manage the contacts of your mobile device (Android, iPhone, iPad, Universal Windows). 

To do so, WLanguage provides you with: 

- the Contact functions. 

- the advanced variables of WLanguage: Contact, ...




**Remark**: For backward compatibility, you also have the ability to use the mContact structure of WLanguage. This solution is not recommended and it should only be used for the applications that operate with a version earlier than Android 2.0.

## Managing the contacts while using the Contact variables
<a name="managing_the_contacts_while_using_the_contact_variables_ELTTEXTE000154"></a>
To manage the contacts found on the mobile device: 

1. Declare a variable of type [Contact](../WDLang3/1000020254.md). This type of variable is used to describe and find out all the characteristics of the contact found in the mobile device. 

2. Use the WLanguage functions according to the requested action: 

	- To read and display in your application the contacts found in the mobile device, use [ContactList](../WDLang3/1000020266.md). This function fills an array of Contact variables. This enables you to browse the array of variables in order to add the different contacts into a looper. For example: 
			
		```wl
		gCurrentContact is Contact
		garrContacts is array of Contacts
		
		LooperDeleteAll(LOOP_CONTACTS)
		
		// List of contacts
		garrContacts = ContactList()
		
		IF garrContacts.Occurrence > 0 THEN
			// Sort the contacts
			ArraySort(garrContacts, asMember, "+Name")
			
			// Add into the looper
			FOR EACH tContact OF garrContacts
				LooperAddLine(LOOP_CONTACTS, ...
					tContact.Name, tContact.FirstName)
			END
			// Display the number of contacts
			STC_NbContacts = StringBuild("%1 contacts", garrContacts.Occurrence)
		END
		```


	- To directly handle the contacts with the native application of the phone, use the following functions: 
			


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [ContactCreate](../WDLang3/1000019556.md) | Displays the window for contact creation of the native application for contact management found on the device (Android, iPhone or iPad, Universal Windows). |
| [ContactDisplay](../WDLang3/1000019506.md) | Opens the form of a contact in the device's native contacts application (Android, iPhone or iPad, Universal Windows). |
| [ContactEdit](../WDLang3/1000019507.md) | Opens the form of a contact in edit mode in the device's native contacts application (Android, iPhone, iPad, Universal Windows). |
| [ContactSelect](../WDLang3/1000019508.md) | Displays the list of contacts found on the device (Android, iPhone or iPad, Universal Windows). |

To manage the contacts of the mobile device, you have the ability to use the mContact structure. This structure is a preset structure of WLanguage used to handle a contact. 

To handle the contacts found on the mobile device: 

- Browse the different contacts with the following functions: 
	


|   |   |

| [ContactNext](../WDLang3/1000006108.md) | Reads the contact after the current contact in a Lotus Notes or Outlook address book. |
| [ContactPrevious](../WDLang3/1000006105.md) | Reads the contact before the current contact in a Lotus Notes or Outlook address book. |
| [ContactRead](../WDLang3/1000006112.md) | Reads a contact in a Lotus Notes or Outlook address book. |
