## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000221"></a>
A mobile device can receive push notifications. A notification is a message that is displayed (and stored) on the device, in the notification center of device. A notification can be used to start a process for example.

A notification is sent from a remote application, usually found on a server. 

The application for sending notifications can be developed in WINDEV or WEBDEV, or via external tools.

## Principle
<a name="principle_ELTTEXTE000245"></a>
Four elements are required to create a push notification system:

- A mobile application (iOS or Android) run on the appropriate device. 

- A notification service that is used to distribute the push messages to the phones or tablets. This service is supplied: 

	- by Google: Firebase
			Remark: the application created before version 22 are using the Google Cloud Messaging mechanism (GCM). This mechanism will be made obsolete by Google from April 2019.

	- by Apple (APM).




- An application server (or provider) that decides to send the messages and that establishes the communication with the business database (this server can be a webservice or a WEBDEV or WINDEV application). 

- A database, used to store the identifiers of the different devices receiving the push messages as well as business data. 




The global operating mode of push messages is as follows: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Notifications-Push-Firebase.gif)


1. The application registers toward the Apple or Google service by using the "device id" and the "application id". 

2. If the registration is successful, the Apple or Google service returns a token (or "registration id") to the application. 

3. The application transmits the token to the application server (provider). 

4. The server stores the token in its database. 




**A push message is send according to the following method**:
**a.** The application server sends a message (by using an SSL socket (iOS) or an HTTPS socket (Android)) containing the token to the Apple or Google service. 
Remark: this sending can be done by an external application, as long as this one can access the business database and the certificate used for the communication with the notification service. 
**b.** The Apple or Google service transmits the message to the relevant device.

## Managing the notifications in the Mobile application
<a name="managing_the_notifications_the_mobile_application_ELTTEXTE000269"></a>
Several functions can be used to manage the notifications in the Mobile application: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [NotifPushDisable](../WDLang3/1000020817.md) | Disables the management of push notifications for a WINDEV Mobile application (Android or IOS). |
| [NotifPushEnable](../WDLang3/1000020816.md) | Enables the management of push notifications in a WINDEV Mobile application (Android or iOS). |
| [NotifPushProcedure](../WDLang3/1000020818.md) | Specifies the WLanguage procedure called when a push notification is received by a WINDEV Mobile application (Android or iOS). |





Caution: a specific configuration is required in order for the mobile applications to operate: 




The behavior when a notification is received is as follows:

1. **If the application is closed**, the system displays the notification in the notification bar. The user can choose to validate the notification. If he does, the application is started. 
	
	Two cases may occur once the application is started:

	- If [NotifPushProcedure](../WDLang3/1000020818.md) was called in the project initialization code, the global procedure passed to this function as parameter is called and the first window of the application is not opened. 
			Remark: [OpenMobileWindow](../WDLang1/1000021018.md) must be called in the procedure. 

	- If [NotifPushProcedure](../WDLang3/1000020818.md) was not called, the first application window is opened.  




2. **If the application is already started**:







Remarks:

- The *exeLaunch* constant of [ExeInfo](../WDLang1/3035001.md) allows you to know if the application was automatically started by the system further to the reception of a push notification: 
	
	```wl
	ExeInfo(exeLaunch) = exePushNotification
	```


- [WinStatus](../WDLang1/3038030.md) allows you to test (if necessary ) the existence of a window in order to open it: 
	
	```wl
	// Summary: Procedure called when clicking on a PUSH notification
	PROCEDURE onPush(MyNotif is Notification)
	
	IF WinStatus("WIN_Main") = NotFound THEN
		// WIN_Main is already open or displayed
		ReceivePushNotif(myNotif, True)
	ELSE
		// Open home window
		OpenMobileWindow(WIN_Main, MyNotif)
	END
	```

## Managing the notifications in the application server
<a name="managing_the_notifications_the_application_server_ELTTEXTE000316"></a>
The application server is the WINDEV application or the WEBDEV site that sends the Push notifications. 

This application server sends the notifications via [NotifPushSend](../WDLang3/1000020819.md). 

**Caution**: [NotifPushSend](../WDLang3/1000020819.md) must know the identifiers (tokens) of the phones affected by the notification. This information must be returned by the mobile application. 

WINDEV Mobile is provided with the following examples: 

- **WD_Push_Server (Webservice)**: 

	1. In the project code, it is necessary to specify:

		- The Android API key

		- The type of Android platform: use the *npeFirebase* or *npeGCM* constants (*npeFirebase* by default). 

		- The path of the certificate that will send the iOS notifications (Certificate to be deployed with the Webservice). 




2. Deploy the Webservice. 

3. Retrieve the URL of the deployed WSDL. 

- **WM Push (Mobile application that receives notifications)**:

	1. Replace the URL of the Webservice already imported into the project with the previously retrieved URL. 

	2. Android deployment:

		- Retrieve the google-services.json Firebase configuration file, otherwise retrieve the project number in Google Cloud Messaging.

		- In the Android generation wizard, make sure that the name of the package is the same as the one defined in the Google services.




3. iOS deployment: Specify the same bundle as the one defined in the Apple console

- **Send Push (Client application to send notifications via the Webservice)**: 

	1. Replace the URL of the Webservice already imported into the project with the previously retrieved URL.

	2. Run the application to send notifications.

	3. For iOS, do not forget to specify the bundle of the application to which the notifications are to be sent.
