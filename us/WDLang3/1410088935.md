The **apiRequest** type is used to define all the advanced characteristics of a request executed via a REST web service imported using the OpenAPI documentation. These characteristics can be defined and changed using different WLanguage properties. 

**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

### Properties specific to apiRequest variables
<a name="properties_specific_apirequest_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000026"></a>

The following properties can be used to handle **apiRequest** variables:

| Property name | Type used | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ClientCertificate | String or buffer | Corresponds to: <br><br>- a character string with an access path to the .p12 file that contains the certificate to attach to the request. The certificate will be automatically loaded taking into account:<br><br>	- the certificate in the executable library (if it has been integrated into the application),<br><br>	- the certificate at the specified location on disk (if the certificate has not been integrated into the executable library).<br><br><br><br><br>- a buffer with the certificate ([fLoadBuffer](../WDLang1/1000019410.md)).<br><br><br><br><br>If this property corresponds to an empty string (""), the default certificate is reset to "&lt;None&gt;". |
| Header | Associative array of character strings | Key/Value set of headers to send.<br><br>Usage example of this property: <br><br><br><pre><code>cMyRequest.Header["Authorization"] = ...<br>	" WSSE profile=""UsernameToken"""<br>cMyRequest.Header["X-WSSE"] = ...<br>	"UsernameToken Username=blahblah "<br>cMyRequest.Header["Cache-Control"] = " no-cache"</code></pre><br> |
| ClientCertificatePassword | Character string | Password associated with the client certificate (empty string by default) |
| ConnectionTimeout | Integer ou Duration | Maximum timeout for the connection expressed in milliseconds (20 seconds by default, which means 20000 milliseconds). This property can correspond to: <br><br>- an integer corresponding to the number of milliseconds,<br><br>- a Duration variable,<br><br>- the duration in a readable format (e.g., 20 s or 20000 ms). <br><br><br><br><br>The connection fails if it cannot be established within this period. |
