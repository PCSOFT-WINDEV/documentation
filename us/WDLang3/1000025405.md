The **AppleID** type corresponds to the identifier resulting from a successful Apple ID authentication. The characteristics of this type of variable can be defined and changed using different WLanguage properties. 

**Remarks**: 

- This feature requires: 

	- iOS 13 or higher; or macOS 10.15 or higher.

	- the activation of "Sign In" in the "Provisioning profile" of your application.




- When authenticating with [AppleSignIn](../WDLang3/1000025404.md), a WLanguage procedure is used to get the result of the authentication (**AppleID** variable). 

- For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).
