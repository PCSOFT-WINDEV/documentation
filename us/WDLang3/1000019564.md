Starts the native application for sending emails found on the current computer: 

- Computer running Windows (using the MAPI client), 

- Mobile device: Android, iPhone, iPad, Universal Windows 10.




The content and recipients of the email message are initialized from the information specified in the WLanguage [Email](../WDLang3/3032029.md) structure.

**Caution**: 

- The application for sending emails found on the current computer must have been configured with a valid account for sending emails (SMTP).

- The current directory can be modified according to the configuration of the application for sending emails. 




![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Remarks: 

- This function is based on the MAPI client installed on the computer ("Simple MAPI" is not sufficient). If the MAPI client is not found, the function searches for the default client among: Microsoft Outlook, Outlook Express, Eudora, IncrediMail, Netscape, Mozilla Thunderbird, Mozilla.

- Both the application and the MAPI client must be in 32 bits or in 64 bits. Indeed, if client is a 64-bit application, it will only be seen by the applications compiled in 64 bits (similarly, if client is a 32-bit application, it will only be seen by the applications compiled in 32 bits).

## Remarks


### Special cases
<a name="special_cases_ELTPARAGRAPHE000083"></a>

- A non-fatal error is triggered if no application for sending emails is found on the current computer. To find out whether the application for sending emails failed to start, use the [ErrorOccurred](../WDLang1/3087001.md) variable.

- To reinitialize the Email structure, use [EmailReset](../WDLang3/3032023.md). 

- **EmailRunApp** is a non-blocking function. The code that follows the call to this function will continue to run as soon as the application for sending emails is started. 

- There is no way to find out whether the sending of the email was validated by the user.
