## Example


```wl
// Define the colors
grHMColor(CHART_HMap, -50, DarkBlue)
grHMColor(CHART_HMap, +50, LightRed)
FOR i = 1 TO 500
	grHMAddData(CHART_HMap, Random(-100, 100), Random(-100, 100), -100)
	grHMAddData(CHART_HMap, Random(-100, 100), Random(-100, 100), 100)
END
grDraw(CHART_HMap)
```

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`grHMColor(<Chart name> , <Level> , <Color>)`
---

**`<Chart name>: (Control name or character string)`**

Name of the chart to be used. This name can correspond to:

- the chart name defined through programming with [grCreate](../WDLang3/3042005.md).

- the name of Chart control found in the window editor or report editor.




**`<Level>: (Real or Constant)`**

Level from which the color will be applied. Corresponds to: 

- a real value,

- the *grHMColorEmptyValue* constant. In this case, the color will be applied to the data outside level or without value. This color is transparent by default. 




**`<Color>: (Integer or Integer constant)`**

Color that will be given to the level. This color can correspond to:

- an RGB color (returned by [RGB](../WDLang1/3029012.md)),

- an HSL color (returned by [HSL](../WDLang1/3029057.md)),

- a preset color (see [the preset colors of WLanguage](../WDLang5/3010002.md)).  

- the *AutomaticColor* constant. In this case, the level is deleted.

## Remarks


### Managing colors
<a name="managing_colors_ELTPARAGRAPHE000098"></a>

The colors are defined by level. For the values found between 2 levels, a linear gradient is applied by default.

This behavior can be modified by [grParameter](../WDLang3/1000018337.md) associated with the *grHMDisplayColor* constant. The following syntax is used:

```txt
grParameter(<Chart name>, grHMDisplayColor, <Display type>)
```



 where &lt;Display type&gt; corresponds to one of the following constants:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *grColorGradient*<br>(Default value) | A linear gradient is applied to the intermediate values. |
| *grLowerLevel* | The display of colors is done by level. All the values less than or equal to the level will take the color given by [grHMColor](../WDLang3/1000021629.md). |
| *grHigherLevel* | The display of colors is done by level. All the values greater than or equal to the level will take the color given by [grHMColor](../WDLang3/1000021629.md). |


For the facets outside color bounds or without value, the color specified by *grHMColorEmptyValue* will be applied. This color is transparent by default.

Remark: The colors defined by **grHMColor** will be taken into account during the next call to [grDraw](../WDLang3/3042026.md).
