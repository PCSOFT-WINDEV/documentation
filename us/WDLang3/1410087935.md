<a name="description"></a>
Displays the permission request for user activity tracking (iOS only). <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=AppleATT.gif)


This authorization is required to use [AppleAdvertisingIdentifier](../WDLang3/1410087936.md).

Remark: the application should be fully functional, even if the user does not grant this permission: only activity tracking will be hindered.

## Remarks


### Customizing the permission request window
<a name="customizing_the_permission_request_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000061"></a>

The text of the authorization request cannot be customized. 

You can, however, add a short explanatory text in the window. This message can be entered in "Permissions", in the iOS application generation wizard. Simply enter a specific text for the "Tracking Usage Description" permission. 


### Configuring advertising tracking manually
<a name="configuring_advertising_tracking_manually_ELTPARAGRAPHE000068"></a>

To configure tracking for an application: 

- Before iOS 14, tracking is common to all applications. It can be configured via "Settings &gt;&gt; Privacy &gt;&gt; Advertising". 

- Starting with iOS 14, ad tracking can be customized: 

	- for the device and applications: "Settings &gt;&gt; Privacy &gt;&gt; Advertising". 

	- for applications: "Settings &gt;&gt; "Application name" &gt;&gt; Allow Tracking".
