Transfers a file or directory from an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) server to the current computer.

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Remark: To quickly retrieve a single file from the FTP server, use [FTPGetFile](../WDLang3/1000024597.md).

## Syntax

`<Result> = FTPGet(<Connection identifier> , <File/Directory to retrieve> , <Destination file/directory> [, <WLanguage procedure> [, <Transfer mode>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the transfer was performed,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) with the *errMessage* constant.
	Remark: The result may be incorrect on some Unix servers: an existing file or directory may not be found.




**`<Connection identifier>: (Integer)`**

Connection identifier, returned by [FTPConnect](../WDLang3/3040016.md).


**`<File/Directory to retrieve>: (Character string)`**

Name and full (or relative) path of the file (or directory) to retrieve. This file (or directory) is found on the FTP server. The different path sections are separated by "slashes" ("/"). 
Caution: the name of the directory is case sensitive. You must use the same case as the one used on the FTP server (uppercase/lowercase characters). 
No wildcard character (\* or?) can be used. To retrieve several files, use [FTPListFile](../WDLang3/3040018.md) beforehand to get the name of the files to retrieve.
					
An absolute path has the following format: "/&lt;DirectoryName&gt;/&lt;FileName&gt;". The tree structure has the following format: "/&lt;DirectoryName&gt;/&lt;FileName&gt;".
A relative path has the following format: "&lt;DirectoryName&gt;/&lt;FileName&gt;". The tree structure has the following format: "/&lt;CurrentServerDirectory&gt;/&lt;DirectoryName&gt;/&lt;FileName&gt;".
							
**If this parameter corresponds to a directory**, all the files found in this directory are retrieved. A directory with the same name is created on the current computer at the location specified by &lt;Destination file/directory&gt;.
			
**If this parameter corresponds to a file**:

- if &lt;Destination file/directory&gt; is a directory found on the current computer, the file to retrieve is copied to the destination directory.

- if &lt;Destination file/directory&gt; is a file found on the current computer, the file to retrieve is copied and renamed.




**`<Destination file/directory>: (Character string)`**

Name and full (or relative) path of the destination file (or directory). A UNC path can be used.

**`<WLanguage procedure>: (Procedure name)`**

Name of WLanguage procedure automatically called to check the transfer progress. This procedure can be a global method of the class (in the following format: &lt;Class name&gt;::&lt;GlobalMethodName&gt;).


**`<Transfer mode>: (Optional Integer constant)`**

Transfer mode used:					


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *ftpASCIIMode* | Transfer performed in ASCII mode. This mode is used to transfer data between two different types of operating systems, from UNIX to Windows for example: the transferred file is changed into the ASCII format of destination system. |
| *ftpBinaryMode*<br>(Default value) | Transfer performed in binary mode. The file is strictly identical between the sending and the receiving. |

### Managing the progress of the transfer
<a name="managing_the_progress_the_transfer_ELTPARAGRAPHE000130"></a>

**FTPGet** is a blocking function: no other action can be performed until the end of current transfer. 

To check the progress of the transfer, **FTPGet** can automatically call the &lt;WLanguage procedure&gt; procedure at regular intervals (every 64 KB).

This procedure is declared as follows:


```txt
PROCEDURE <Procedure name>(<Total size>, <Transferred size>)
```
where: 						

- &lt;Total size&gt; is an integer corresponding to the total size of file or directory currently transferred.

- &lt;Transferred size&gt; is an integer corresponding to the number of bytes already transferred.




In this procedure, you can:

- display a progress bar (using a Progress Bar control for example),

- find out whether the transfer is completed (&lt;Total size&gt; = &lt;Transferred size&gt;).




**FTPGet** cannot be interrupted as long as all files have not been transferred. To force the interruption of the browse, use the following code line in the &lt;Procedure name&gt; procedure:	


```wl
RESULT False
```
In any other case (to continue the browse), &lt;Procedure name&gt; MUST return <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>.

An error is generated if &lt;Procedure name&gt; returns no value (neither <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> nor <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>).

### Transfer timeout
<a name="transfer_timeout_ELTPARAGRAPHE000177"></a>

By default, all the FTP functions fail if the FTP server does not respond within 20 seconds. This timeout can be modified with [FTPConnect](../WDLang3/3040016.md) when connecting to the FTP server.

<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Rights of users
<a name="rights_users_ELTPARAGRAPHE000205"></a>

Only a user who has read rights on the FTP server can retrieve the files found on an FTP server. In most cases, the read rights are granted to the "anonymous" users.					
<a name="NOTE0_5"></a>


### Relative and absolute path
<a name="relative_and_absolute_path_ELTPARAGRAPHE000212"></a>

The notions of relative path and absolute path are very important in an FTP application.

- A path starting with a slash is considered as being an **absolute path**: it is the path in relation to the root of the FTP server (parameter specific to the server).
	ex: /ad/user/JULIA

- A path not starting with a slash is considered as being a **relative path**, which means a path given in relation to the current directory. This current directory can be returned or modified by [FTPCurrentDir](../WDLang3/3040003.md).




When connecting to an FTP site, the initial directory (the "home directory" of the user) is not necessarily found at the root of the FTP server. Therefore, we recommend that you use relative paths.

### AS/400 FTP server
<a name="as400_ftp_server_ELTPARAGRAPHE000229"></a>

**FTPGet** does not work properly on an AS/400 FTP server.

In this case, we recommend that you use [FTPCommand](../WDLang3/3040017.md) with the FTP "RETR" command (for more details, see the documentation about the FTP server).
