<a name="description"></a>
Defines the algorithm for aggregating data in a clustered or stacked Column chart. 
<a name="Example1"></a>
<a name="sample_code"></a>

## Example


```wl
// Code of Radio Button control used to select the aggregation type
// Store the selected type of aggregation
let nAggregation = SWITCH (RADIO_AggregationType, grhaNone, grhaMax, grhaMin, grhaMean, grhaSum)

// Apply the aggregation
grColumnAggregation(CHART_Chart, nAggregation)

// Redraw the example
grDraw(CHART_Chart)
```

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`grColumnAggregation(<Chart name> , <Algorithm>)`
---

**`<Chart name>: (Control name or character string)`**

Name of the chart to be used. This name corresponds to:

- the chart name defined through programming with [grCreate](../WDLang3/3042005.md).

- the name of the Chart control (in the window, page or report editor).




**`<Algorithm>: (Integer constant)`**

Aggregation algorithm to use: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *grhaMax* | Aggregation according to the maximum of data. |
| *grhaMean* | Aggregation according to the mean of data. |
| *grhaMin* | Aggregation according to the minimum of data. |
| *grhaNone* | No aggregation. |
| *grhaSum* | Aggregation according to the sum of data. |

## Remarks


### When should the aggregation be used?
<a name="when_should_the_aggregation_used_ELTPARAGRAPHE000080"></a>

When displaying a Column chart, the bars may become too small to be displayed. This is the case for the charts presenting a time scale. In this case, it becomes necessary to display a bar whose minimum size is the size of a mark and aggregating the data of all potential bars found in this mark.

### Aggregation and type of charts
<a name="aggregation_and_type_charts_ELTPARAGRAPHE000102"></a>

- For the charts without time scale, the aggregation is not enabled by default.

- For the charts with time scale, the default aggregation is the sum of columns.
