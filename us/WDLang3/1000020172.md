## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = SpeechSynthesisReadFile(<Name and path of text file> [, <Locking>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the file content was read (locking mode) or if the file content was added to the reading queue (non-locking mode), 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> in case of failure. If an error occurs, the [ErrorOccurred](../WDLang1/3087001.md) variable is set to <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md).




**`<Name and path of text file>: (Character string)`**

Name and full (or relative) path of text file to read.

**`<Locking>: (Optional boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>: the function is run in locking mode. The code following the call to the function will be run once the entire file is read or when the function fails. An hourglass will be displayed during the read operation. Use [NextTitle](../WDLang1/3038043.md) to customize the message displayed by the hourglass.
	

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> (default value): the function is run in non-locking mode. The code following the call to the function will be run as soon as the reading of the file starts or when the function fails.

## Remarks


### Operating mode
<a name="operating_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000087"></a>

- If a new read operation is triggered while another read operation is in progress, the new read operation will start once the first one is over. 
	To know whether a read operation is in progress on the speech synthesis engine, use [SpeechSynthesisInProgress](../WDLang3/1000020173.md). 
	To stop the current read operations, use [SpeechSynthesisStop](../WDLang3/1000020174.md).

- To define the parameters that will be used by the engine for speech synthesis (language, reading speed, etc.), use [SpeechSynthesisInitialize](../WDLang3/1000020171.md).
	If the speech synthesis parameters have not been previously defined by [SpeechSynthesisInitialize](../WDLang3/1000020171.md), the default parameters will be used and the language for text reading will be the first language available for the speech synthesis engine according to the following sequence: 

	- Application language (default language or language defined by [Nation](../WDLang1/3054014.md)), 

	- Language of device,

	- English,

	- Default language of engine for speech synthesis.




- To read the content of a character string, use [SpeechSynthesisReadText](../WDLang3/1000019805.md).
