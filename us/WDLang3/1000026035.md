<a name="description"></a>
Writes one or more single-precision floats to a Modbus slave, starting at a specific address.

Remarks: 

- This function is used to write one or more single-precision floats in contiguous registers in the slave. 

- This function blocks the application until the slave acknowledges the message or until the session timeout is exceeded. 

- The writing of one or more floats corresponds to Modbus function code 16 (Write Multiple Holding Registers)..

## Example


```wl
// Create a session and connect to a Modbus server
Session is modbusSession
Session = ModbusConnectTCP("192.168.1.7")

// If the connection fails, display the error
IF ErrorOccurred = True THEN
	Trace(ErrorInfo())
ELSE
	// Write a sequence of 5 floats starting at address 0x42
	IF NOT Session.WriteFloat(0x42, [1.5, 3.1415, 2.718, -15, 0.0], modbusABCD) THEN
		Trace(ErrorInfo())	
	END
END

// Disconnection
Session.Disconnect()
```

## Syntax

### Writing 1 single-precision float to a Modbus slave

`<Result> = <Session>.WriteFloat(<Address> , <Floating> , <Endianness>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if written successfully,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) with the *errMessage* constant.




**`<Session>: (modbusSession variable)`**

Name of the [modbusSession](../WDLang3/1000025924.md) variable that corresponds to the communication session with the Modbus slave.

**`<Address>: (Integer)`**

Value between 0 and 65,535 that corresponds to the address (slave) to which the single-precision float must be written.

**`<Floating>: (Real)`**

Value of the single-precision float to be written to the register.

**`<Endianness>: (Integer constant)`**

Mode for storing float values on the slave device. Bytes are identified from A to D. A is the most significant byte and D is the least significant byte (IEEE-754 standard).


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *modbusABCD* | The sent bytes are stored the same order on the slave device. |
| *modbusBADC* | The sent bytes are swapped 2 by 2 on the slave device. |
| *modbusCDAB* | The sent bytes are swapped 2 by 2 on the slave device. |
| *modbusDCBA* | The sent bytes are swapped on the slave device. |

### Writing multiple single-precision floats to a Modbus slave

`<Result> = <Session>.WriteFloat(<Address> , <Floats to be sent> , <Endianness>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if written successfully,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) with the *errMessage* constant.




**`<Session>: (modbusSession variable)`**

Name of the [modbusSession](../WDLang3/1000025924.md) variable that corresponds to the communication session with the Modbus slave.

**`<Address>: (Integer)`**

Value between 0 and 65,535 that corresponds to the address (slave) to which the single-precision floats must be written.

**`<Floats to be sent>: (Array)`**

Name of the array of single-precision reals to be sent.

**`<Endianness>: (Integer constant)`**

Mode for storing float values on the slave device. Bytes are identified from A to D. A is the most significant byte and D is the least significant byte (IEEE-754 standard).

## Remarks
CAUTION: Since write operations make it possible to control PLCs, it is recommended to test the different commands before the production phase to make sure the PLCs perform the required operations.
