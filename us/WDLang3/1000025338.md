## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000188"></a>
The latest versions of mobile OSs allow you to switch applications to a dark theme to reduce battery consumption or to make the device easier to use in a low-light environment.

WINDEV Mobile allows you to use dark theme in your mobile applications. It allows you to: 

- automatically adapt to the device theme settings. The dark theme will automatically be used.  

- force the use of dark theme or light theme through programming.

## Implementation

### Dark theme management
<a name="dark_theme_management_ELTPARAGRAPHE000023"></a>

**To manage dark theme in one of your mobile applications**: 

1. Open the project description window: on the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, click "Description".

2. In the "Style" tab, check "Allow switching to dark theme (automatically or manually via ChangeTheme)".

3. Validate. 


Caution: After using this option, the application must be tested to make sure there are no UI errors. 

**Remarks**: 

- The project is associated with a single skin template. This skin template corresponds to the light theme. Windows are always edited in light theme. The skin template used for the dark theme is **BlackStellar**. 

- Tip: Use skin template styles if possible. If colors or images are fixed through programming, use the optional events "Application of light/dark theme" to use a specific color according to the theme used. 





### Testing an application that uses dark theme in the simulator
<a name="testing_application_that_uses_dark_theme_the_simulator_ELTPARAGRAPHE000056"></a>

When dark theme is enabled in a WINDEV Mobile project, the simulator offers an additional option (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Theme_sombre%20-%20HC%20N%B0002%201.gif)
) allowing to switch the application from one theme to another. 

Example: 

1. Start the application test: ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Theme_sombre%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif)

	 The light theme is used by default. 

2. Click the icon to switch to dark mode: ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Theme_sombre%20-%20HC%20N%B0002%201.gif)
. 

3. Window displayed with dark theme during test. ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Theme_sombre%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.gif)






### Special case: Do not use dark theme on a window
<a name="special_case_not_use_dark_theme_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000075"></a>

To not apply dark theme on one of the windows of the application: 

1. Open the window description (e.g. "Description", in the context menu). 

2. In the "Style" tab, check "Do not apply dark theme".

3. Validate the description window.

## Programming in WLanguage
<a name="programming_wlanguage_ELTTEXTE000248"></a>


### Overview
<a name="overview_ELTPARAGRAPHE000093"></a>

After enabling dark mode management, WINDEV Mobile proposes: 

- "Application of light/dark theme", a new event to customize the switch to dark mode if necessary. 

- WLanguage functions to find out, modify and retrieve the theme used. 





### Specific events
<a name="specific_events_ELTPARAGRAPHE000101"></a>

When dark theme management is enabled, the "Application of light/dark theme" event becomes available for the project, for windows and internal windows. 

**The event "Application of light/dark theme" of the project** is run in the following cases: 

- When the application starts (after the "Initialization" event of the project).

- When the theme is changed in the code with [ChangeTheme](../WDLang3/1000025266.md) only if the *withCodeExecution* constant has been specified.

- When the system automatically changes the theme: modification of system settings, changing the day/night time, activating/deactivating the battery saver, etc.




**The event "Application of light/dark theme" of the windows** is an optional event. This event is run in the following cases: 

- When the window is opened, after the "Global declarations" event and before the initialization events of the window controls. 

- If the window is open when the theme is changed with [ChangeTheme](../WDLang3/1000025266.md), only if the *withCodeExecution* constant has been specified.

- If the window is open when the system automatically changes the theme: modification of system settings, changing the day/night time, activating/deactivating the battery saver, etc.




**The event "Application of light/dark theme" of the internal windows** is an optional event. This event is run in the following cases: 

- When loading the internal window, after the "Global declarations" event and before the initialization events of the internal window controls. 

- If the internal window is loaded when changing the theme through programming with [ChangeTheme](../WDLang3/1000025266.md), only if the *withCodeExecution* constant has been specified.

- It the internal window is loaded when the system automatically changes the theme: modification of system settings, changing the day/night time, activating/deactivating the battery saver, etc.




Remark: These events are not run: 

- if the application does not support dark theme. 

- if the window ignores dark theme. 





### WLanguage functions
<a name="wlanguage_functions_ELTPARAGRAPHE000138"></a>The following WLanguage functions are used to manage the dark theme: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [ChangeTheme](../WDLang3/1000025266.md) | Is used to change, through programming, the theme (dark or light) used by the mobile application. |
| [GetTheme](../WDLang3/1000025320.md) | Is used to find out the current theme of a mobile application. |
| [SysTheme](../WDLang1/1000019646.md) | Returns the current theme used on the mobile device. |
