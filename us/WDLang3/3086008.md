## Installing a Webservice
<a name="installing_webservice_ELTTEXTE000187"></a>
Two methods can be used to install a Webservice:

- Automatic setup via WDSOAPINST.EXE

- Manual setup.



<a name="NOTE5_2"></a>


### Special case: Setup with IIS 7
<a name="special_case_setup_with_iis_7_ELTPARAGRAPHE000035"></a>

If the Webservice must be installed with the IIS 7 server, the following operations must be performed BEFORE a manual setup or an automatic setup is performed.

In order for SOAP to operate properly with IIS 7, some features of Windows Vista must be enabled.

To do so, from the control panel of Windows:

1. Start the "Programs and features" menu.

2. Click the link "Turn Windows features on or off".

3. Expand the "Internet services (IIS)" features.

4. The following features must necessarily be checked:

	- ***Compatibility with the IIS metabase and with the IIS 6 configuration.*** This option is available in the "Web management tools" section.

	- ***CGI*** and ISAPI extensions. These options are available in the "Application development features" section.

	- ***Static content*** and ***Default document***. These options are available in the "Common HTTP features" section.

	- ***Basic authentication***. This option is available in the "Security" section.




5. We also advise you to check the following options:

	- ***IIS management console***. This option is available in the "Web management tools" section.

	- ***FTP management console***. This option is available in the "FTP publication service" section.

	- ***HTTP logging***. This option is available in the "Health and diagnostics" process.

	- ***FTP server***. This option is available in the "FTP publication service" section.

### Automatic setup
<a name="automatic_setup_ELTPARAGRAPHE000062"></a>

To create the setup program: 

1. Start WDSoapInst.exe. This application is found in the "\\Programs" directory of WINDEV.

2. Select the service to deploy (.WDL file of your project).

3. Specify the deployment address of the service. This address must correspond to the address for which the Webservice was generated.

4. Specify whether the setup of the SOAP server must be proposed (optional setup for example for an update of the Webservice). <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WDSOAPSetup.gif)


5. Validate. The setup program is generated in the "InstallWebService" directory of the project. The content of this directory must be copied onto the computer where the Webservice is installed.  




To install the Webservice : 

1. Copy the generated files onto the server.

2. Run WDSOAPSetup.exe.

3. Specify the server for which the Webservice must be installed. Specify whether the SOAP server must be installed.

4. If the SOAP server must be installed, confirm the different settings of the SOAP server (DLL location, log file, ...). This information can be modified at any time in the SOAP administrator. For more details, see [Configuring the administrator](../WDLang3/3086007.md).

5. Specify the options for configuring the service: location of the files, download time, ...

6. Validate. The test of the Webservice is available.




**Remark**: If several Webservices are installed on the same computer, you must install:

- all the libraries (WDL) in the same directory, 

- all the WINDEV DLLs used in the same directory.




A single SOAP administrator will be installed and used.

**Caution**: The rights granted to the user of the http site are very important. If a WINDEV SOAP server must write into a file, write rights must be granted to the user of the site (Internet guest).

**Note for information**: the operations performed by the installer are as follows:

- Creating an alias between ".soap" and wd180siis.dll. The .soap files are redirected toward this DLL.

- Create an alias (virtual directory) on the directory of the Webservice.

### Manual setup
<a name="manual_setup_ELTPARAGRAPHE000104"></a>

To install your application on a SOAP server:

1. Create the client version of your application ("Tools .. Create the client version"). The following files must be selected for the setup:

	- **WDSOAPConfig.EXE** found in the "Data" directory of the setup directory of WINDEV.

	- The WINDEV DLLs required to run your application. Check whether the following DLLs are selected: wd180img.dll, wd180obj.dll, wd180pnt.dll, wd180std.dll and wd180vm.dll.

	- The WINDEV DLLs specific to the HTTP server used: wd180sapa.dll for Apache 1.3, wd180sapa2.dll for Apache 2.0, wd180siis for IIS, etc.




2. Install the application on the WINDEV SOAP server.  

3. Configure the Internet server for your WINDEV application:

	- [Configuration for Apache](../WDLang3/3086004.md)

	- [Configuration for ISS5](../WDLang3/3086005.md)

	- [Configuration for Netscape iPlanet 4.1](../WDLang3/3086006.md)




4. Configure the SOAP administrator. For more details, see [Configuring the administrator](../WDLang3/3086007.md).

5. In order for the SOAP client to contact the server, the server address used in [SOAPRun](../WDLang3/3069013.md) must have the following format: 
	&lt;Name or IP Address of Server&gt;\\Service.soap




**Remark**: If several Webservices are installed on the same computer, you must install:

- all the libraries (WDL) in the same directory, 

- all the WINDEV DLLs used in the same directory.




A single SOAP administrator will be installed and used.

**Caution**: The rights granted to the user of the http site are very important. If a WINDEV SOAP server must write into a file, write rights must be granted to the user of the site (Internet guest).
