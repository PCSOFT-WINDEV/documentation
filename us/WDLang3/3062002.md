## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000180"></a>
Several devices can be managed directly via a management of the ports used by these devices to communicate with the computer. Therefore, the management of a serial, parallel or infrared port can be used to directly manage a bar code reader or a print as you go.

WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile allow you to manage the actions performed on these different ports.

**Remarks**: 

- ![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Infrared ports are not supported.

- ![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) Only serial ports are supported.

## Serial port/parallel port/infrared port

Several WLanguage functions can be used to easily manage the serial and parallel ports. All these functions start with the letter **s**.

You can for example:

- open a serial or parallel port ([sOpen](../WDLang3/3062013.md)) or close it ([sClose](../WDLang3/3062010.md)).

- write into a serial port ([sWrite](../WDLang3/3062009.md)) or read its content ([sRead](../WDLang3/3062012.md)).




For more details on the available functionalities, see [Serial and parallel port management functions](../WDLang3/3062003.md).

### Using an external library: RXTX
<a name="using_external_library_rxtx_ELTPARAGRAPHE000237"></a>

In Java, the use of functions for handling the serial and parallel ports ([sOpen](../WDLang3/3062013.md), [sWrite](../WDLang3/3062009.md), [sRead](../WDLang3/3062012.md), ...) requires the presence of an external library: RXTX. 

This library includes a Jar archive and one or more native libraries that depend on the operating system on which the application is run.
 
To use these functions: 

- the Jar archive (RXTXComm.jar) must: 

	- be found in the same directory as the Java application generated by WINDEV, 

	- be found in the execution classpath of the application, 

	- be directly included in the generated application (from the wizard for Java generation). 




- the native libraries corresponding to the operating system on which the application is run must be found: 

	- in the same directory as the Java application generated by WINDEV, 

	- in the path of the application libraries (librarypath).







The RXTX library and its documentation can be downloaded from: [http://users.frii.com/jarvi/rxtx/index.html](http://users.frii.com/jarvi/rxtx/index.html) (link valid at the time this documentation was published). 

**Caution**: The management of infrared ports is not available in Java. 


![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) **Special case for Linux**: 

- Only serial ports can be opened and initialized. 

- By default, users do not have access to serial ports. It is necessary to grant them specific rights to manage serial ports.

## USB port
<a name="usb_port_ELTTEXTE000303"></a>
The management of a USB port does not depend on the port itself but on the device that is attached to it. The management of a USB port to which a printer is connected differs from the management of a USB port to which a scanner is connected. No management standard can be defined.

The USB port is not a passive port like the serial port or the parallel port. It is always subject to the use of a specific driver for the device used.

Therefore, WINDEV or WEBDEV does not manage the USB port but the device that is installed on this port. If the device installed is:

- a printer, you have the ability to use the print functions.

- a scanner, you have the ability to use the TWAIN functions, 

- ...




In most cases, the devices connected to a USB port are supplied with a driver. We advise you handle this driver from WINDEV directly.

WINDEV offers [USB functions](../WDLang1/3090005.md) to handle the elements accessible from a USB port.
