| --- | --- |
| [TwoFactorAuthenticationCheckCode](../WDLang3/1000025976.md) | Verifies the code given by an authentication application. |
| [TwoFactorAuthenticationGenerateLink](../WDLang3/1000025975.md) | Generates a link to register an account in an authentication application. When associated with a Bar Code control, this link will show a QR code that can be scanned in the authentication app installed on the phone. |
