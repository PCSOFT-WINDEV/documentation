	 This feature is reserved for advanced use to manage special cases.. In most cases, we recommend importing the wsdl of the SOAP webservice. For more details, see [Importing/Consuming Webservices](../WDLang3/3086001.md).

## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000131"></a>
WINDEV include several SOAP functions. These functions allow you to manage the execution of procedures on a SOAP server from your WINDEV applications.

## Principle
<a name="principle_ELTTEXTE000155"></a>
All the parameters required to run a SOAP procedure are supplied in the documentation of the SOAP server.

To run a procedure on a SOAP server:

1. Initialize the structure of parameters for the procedure to run (see [structure of a SOAP procedure](../WDLang3/3069009.md)).
	Remark: To perform additional checks on the SOAP server, add a procedure header ([SOAPAddHeader](../WDLang3/3069001.md)).

2. Run the procedure ([SOAPRun](../WDLang3/3069013.md) or [SOAPRunXML](../WDLang3/3069014.md)). The following operations are automatically performed:

	- connecting the current computer and the SOAP server.

	- transmitting the parameters of the procedure to the SOAP server.

	- checking the header if necessary.

	- running the procedure.

	- returning the procedure result or error to the current computer.




3. Check the procedure result.




The result of [SOAPRun](../WDLang3/3069013.md) or [SOAPRunXML](../WDLang3/3069014.md) is used to find out whether the connection was successfully established.

If the connection was not established, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) to find out the cause of the error.

If the connection was established, check the result of [SOAPGetResult](../WDLang3/3069002.md):

- if the result is not an empty string (""), the procedure was successfully run.

- if the result is an empty string (""), the procedure was not run and/or an error was returned. To find out the procedure error, use [SOAPError](../WDLang3/3069005.md).

## Remark
<a name="remark_ELTTEXTE000179"></a>
The transfers are not secured at the moment (the data transferred is not encrypted). The SOAP protocol should not be used to transfer sensitive data.
