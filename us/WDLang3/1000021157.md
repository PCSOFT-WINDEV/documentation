The **sshSession** type is used to define the characteristics of a connection to an SSH server. The characteristics of this connection are described by several WLanguage properties. 

**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

## Example


```wl
cMySession is sshSession
cMySession.Address = "127.0.0.1"
cMySession.Port = 22
cMySession.User = "login"
cMySession.UserPassword = "pass"
```

### Properties specific to sshSession variables
<a name="properties_specific_sshsession_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000048"></a>

The following properties can be used to define a connection to an SSH server:

| Property name | Type used | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Address | Character string | Address of SSH server. <br><br>This address can be given in the following format:<br><br>- IP address in XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX format (125.5.110.100 for example).<br><br>- IP address containing the server name (SSHServer for example). This syntax is recommended.<br><br><br> |
| ConnectionTimeout | Integer ou Duration | Connection timeout expressed in milliseconds (20 seconds by default, which means 20000 milliseconds). This property can correspond to: <br><br>- an integer corresponding to the number of milliseconds,<br><br>- a Duration variable,<br><br>- the duration in a readable format (e.g., 20 s or 20000 ms). <br><br><br> |
| Port | Integer | Connection port (22 by default). |
| PrivateKey | Character string or [Certificate](../WDLang1/1000019287.md) variable | Name of the variable of type [Certificate](../WDLang1/1000019287.md) to be used or key files in OpenSSH format (for a connection by private key). <br><br>If this property is specified, an authentication by key is performed: only the **User**, **PrivateKey** and **PrivateKeyPassword** properties are taken into account. |
| PrivateKeyPassword | Character string | Password of key file (for a connection by private key). The **PrivateKey** property corresponds to the private key to be used.  |
| User | Character string | User name. |
| UserPassword | Character string | User's password used in password authentication (the **User** property is the user's name). |

### Authentication mode
<a name="authentication_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000123"></a>

The authentication by key has priority over the authentication by password. 

Key authentication is used if: 

- the server supports this authentication mode. 

- the **PrivateKey** property is specified. 




Password authentication is used if: 

- the server supports this authentication mode. 

- the **UserPassword** is specified.

### Using sshSession variables
<a name="using_sshsession_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000140"></a>

**sshSession** variables can be used in WLanguage functions: 

- standard syntax: 
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [SSHCommand](../WDLang3/1000021143.md) | Sends a command to an SSH server. The session is automatically started and closed as soon as the command is sent. |
| [SSHConnectShell](../WDLang3/1000021147.md) | Starts a new SSH session of "Shell" type. |
| [SSHDisconnectShell](../WDLang3/1000021148.md) | Closes an SSH session that was opened by [SSHConnectShell](../WDLang3/1000021147.md). |
| [SSHRead](../WDLang3/1000021149.md) | Reads the data found on the output buffer of the SSH session. |
| [SSHWrite](../WDLang3/1000021150.md) | Writes data into the specified SSH session. |

- prefix syntax: 
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [&lt;sshSession variable&gt;.ConnectShell](../WDLang3/1000021163.md) | Starts a new SSH session of "Shell" type. |
| [&lt;sshSession variable&gt;.DisconnectShell](../WDLang3/1000021164.md) | Closes an SSH session that was opened by [SSHConnectShell](../WDLang3/1000021147.md). |
| [&lt;sshSession variable&gt;.Read](../WDLang3/1000021167.md) | Reads the data found on the output buffer of the SSH session. |
| [&lt;sshSession variable&gt;.Write](../WDLang3/1000021166.md) | Writes data into the specified SSH session. |
