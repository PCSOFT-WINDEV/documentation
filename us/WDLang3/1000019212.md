Returns the direction represented by a location in relation to another one.

This direction is expressed in angle format (clockwise in degrees) by taking the geographical North as reference.

## Example



<a name="Example2"></a>

```wl
pos1 is geoPosition
pos1.Latitude = 1.442951
pos1.Longitude = 43.604363

pos2 is geoPosition
pos2.Latitude = 2.505874
pos2.Longitude = 50.458744

InfoBuild("The direction is %1°", geoAzimuth(pos1, pos2))
```

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = geoAzimuth(<Location 1> , <Location 2>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Real)`**

Direction (in degrees) in relation to the geographical North represented by &lt;Location 2&gt; in relation to &lt;Location 1&gt;, taking the shortest way between the two.

**`<Location 1>: (geoPosition variable)`**

Name of the [geoPosition](../WDLang3/1000019191.md) variable corresponding to the first location to compare.

**`<Location 2>: (geoPosition variable)`**

Name of the [geoPosition](../WDLang3/1000019191.md) variable corresponding to the second location to compare.

## Remarks
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


- If &lt;Location 2&gt; is located to the South of &lt;Location 1&gt;, **geoAzimuth** returns 180. 

- The calculation of the direction between the two locations is based on the WGS84 ellipsoid.
