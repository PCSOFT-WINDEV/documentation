Used to connect to a Bluetooth Low Energy device.

Two syntaxes are available: 

- Syntax 1: Locking connection.

- Syntax 2: Non-locking connection. This syntax is used to connect to a Bluetooth device from its physical address. You can for example connect the application to a device whose physical address was stored during a previous detection (with [BTLEListDevice](../WDLang3/1000021882.md)) as soon as this device is switched on and/or enters in the detection area of device.




**In Windows, this function has no effect**. The system automatically determines whether a connection should be opened or not when a request is made. However, you must use BTLEInitialize to set the [btleDevice](../WDLang3/1000022054.md) type to a valid status.

### Connecting to a Bluetooth Low Energy device (locking connection)

`<Result> = <Device>.Connect([<Timeout>])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the connection was established,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) returns more information on the error.




**`<Device>: (btleDevice variable)`**

Name of the [btleDevice](../WDLang3/1000022054.md) variable that represents the Bluetooth Low Energy device with which the connection will be established. This device was detected by [BTLEListDevice](../WDLang3/1000021882.md).

**`<Timeout>: (Optional integer or optional Duration)`**

Connection timeout (in milliseconds). If the connection was not established during this timeout, &lt;Result&gt; is set to <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>.
If this parameter is not specified, the default connection timeout is set to 5 seconds.
This parameter can correspond to: 

- an integer corresponding to the number of milliseconds,

- a Duration variable,

- the duration in a readable format (e.g., 1 s or 10 ms).

### Connecting to a Bluetooth Low Energy device (non-locking connection)

`<Device>.Connect(<WLanguage procedure>)`
---

**`<Device>: (btleDevice variable)`**

Name of the [btleDevice](../WDLang3/1000022054.md) variable that represents the Bluetooth Low Energy device with which the connection will be established.

**`<WLanguage procedure>: (Procedure name)`**

Name of the WLanguage procedure ("callback" procedure) that will be called when connecting to the Bluetooth Low Energy device.
This procedure has the following format:

```txt
PROCEDURE <Procedure name> (<Device>, <Result>)
```
where: 

- &lt;Device&gt; is a variable of type [btleDevice](../WDLang3/1000022054.md) that corresponds to the connected Bluetooth device.

- &lt;Result&gt; is a boolean variable: 

	- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the connection was established,

	- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) returns more information on the error.
