## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000157"></a>
WINDEV and WINDEV Mobile propose the WiFi functions to easily access the Wi-Fi networks. This group of functions can be used both in the WINDEV applications and in the Android applications.

## Wi-Fi and WINDEV: Principle
<a name="wifi_and_windev_principle_ELTTEXTE000181"></a>
The principle for using the WiFi functions is as follows: 

1. List the Wi-Fi network cards accessible from the current computer ([WiFiListNetworkCard](../WDLang3/1000020693.md)). 

2. Select the Wi-Fi network card to use ([WiFiSelectNetworkCard](../WDLang3/1000020694.md)). 

3. Detect the available Wi-Fi access points with [WiFiDetectAccessPoint](../WDLang3/1000019353.md). 

4. List the Wi-Fi networks configured on the computer ([WiFiListNetwork](../WDLang3/1000019356.md)). 

5. If an available Wi-Fi access point is found in the list of stored Wi-Fi networks, you have the ability to connect to it ([WiFiConnect](../WDLang3/1000019352.md)). 




The available functions are as follows: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [WiFiConnect](../WDLang3/1000019352.md) | Connects the device to the specified Wi-Fi network. |
| [WiFiConnectionInfo](../WDLang3/1000019355.md) | Returns the requested information about the current Wi-Fi connection of the device. |
| [WiFiDeleteNetwork](../WDLang3/1000019357.md) | Deletes a network from the list of Wi-Fi networks configured on the device. |
| [WiFiDetectAccessPoint](../WDLang3/1000019353.md) | Starts detecting the Wi-Fi access points currently accessible from the device. |
| [WiFiListNetwork](../WDLang3/1000019356.md) | Returns the list of Wi-Fi networks configured on the device. |
| [WiFiListNetworkCard](../WDLang3/1000020693.md) | Returns the list of Wi-Fi network cards currently available on the current computer. |
| [WiFiSelectNetworkCard](../WDLang3/1000020694.md) | Selects the Wi-Fi network card that will be used for the next calls to the WiFi functions. |

## Wi-Fi and Android: Principle
<a name="wifi_and_android_principle_ELTTEXTE000256"></a>
The principle for using the WiFi functions is as follows: 

1. Check the Wi-Fi status on the mobile device ([WiFiStatus](../WDLang3/1000019354.md)) and enable it if necessary ([WiFiActivate](../WDLang3/1000019350.md)). If multiple available Wi-Fi networks are found during the activation, the device will connect to the best Wi-Fi network. 

2. Detect the Wi-Fi access points ([WiFiDetectAccessPoint](../WDLang3/1000019353.md)). This allows you to find out all the accessible Wi-Fi networks. 

3. List the Wi-Fi networks saved ([WiFiListNetwork](../WDLang3/1000019356.md)). 

4. If an available Wi-Fi access point is found in the list of saved networks, you have the ability to connect to it ([WiFiConnect](../WDLang3/1000019352.md)). 

5. If an available Wi-Fi access point is not found in the list of saved networks, you have the ability to configure it ([WiFiAddNetwork](../WDLang3/1000019351.md)) and to connect to it ([WiFiConnect](../WDLang3/1000019352.md)).




The available functions are as follows: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [WiFiActivate](../WDLang3/1000019350.md) | Enables or disables Wi-Fi on the device. |
| [WiFiAddNetwork](../WDLang3/1000019351.md) | Adds a new network to the list of Wi-Fi networks configured on the device. |
| [WiFiConnect](../WDLang3/1000019352.md) | Connects the device to the specified Wi-Fi network. |
| [WiFiConnectionInfo](../WDLang3/1000019355.md) | Returns the requested information about the current Wi-Fi connection of the device. |
| [WiFiDeleteNetwork](../WDLang3/1000019357.md) | Deletes a network from the list of Wi-Fi networks configured on the device. |
| [WiFiDetectAccessPoint](../WDLang3/1000019353.md) | Starts detecting the Wi-Fi access points currently accessible from the device. |
| [WiFiListNetwork](../WDLang3/1000019356.md) | Returns the list of Wi-Fi networks configured on the device. |
| [WiFiStatus](../WDLang3/1000019354.md) | Returns the current activation status of Wi-Fi on the device or asks to be notified when the activation status of Wi-Fi changes. |

## Wi-Fi and iOS: Principle
<a name="wifi_and_ios_principle_ELTTEXTE000338"></a>
In the iOS applications, the Wi-Fi functions are used to: 

- Find out the activation status of Wi-Fi. 

- Get the list of Wi-Fi networks. The available functions are as follows: 





|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [WiFiListNetwork](../WDLang3/1000019356.md) | Returns the list of Wi-Fi networks configured on the device. |
| [WiFiStatus](../WDLang3/1000019354.md) | Returns the current activation status of Wi-Fi on the device or asks to be notified when the activation status of Wi-Fi changes. |
