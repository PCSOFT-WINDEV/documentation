## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = awSendInfo(<Data>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the sending was successful

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) returns more details about the error.




**`<Data>: (Buffer)`**

Data to send.



<a name="NOTE0"></a>
<a name="NOTE0_1"></a>

## Remarks


- The receiver will receive the data sent via the procedure passed to [awProcedureGetInfo](../WDLang3/1000022119.md).

- If the data has not changed since the previous call, the receiver procedure will not be called. 

- The data or information send is considered as being volatile: each successive call replaces the data sent by the previous call. 

- The data is transferred in background to reduce the use of the battery. Therefore, the data can be transmitted quite a long time after the effective call.

- The data sent must be preferably small (to avoid overloading the communication between the watch and the phone).
