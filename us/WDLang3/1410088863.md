The functions to handle keys in an Apple iCloud-based container of "key-value" pairs are as follows: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [iCloudKeyValueExist](../WDLang3/1410088740.md) | Checks if there is a key in an Apple iCloud-based container of "key-value" pairs. |
| [iCloudKeyValueListKey](../WDLang3/1410088856.md) | Lists the keys contained in an Apple iCloud-based container of "key-value" pairs. |
| [iCloudKeyValueRead](../WDLang3/1410088741.md) | Reads the value of a key in an Apple iCloud-based container of "key-value" pairs. |
| [iCloudKeyValueRemove](../WDLang3/1410088742.md) | Removes a key from an Apple iCloud-based container of "key-value" pairs. |
| [iCloudKeyValueWatch](../WDLang3/1410088760.md) | Defines the procedure called when the value of a key is changed in an Apple iCloud-based container of "key-value" pairs. |
| [iCloudKeyValueWrite](../WDLang3/1410088739.md) | Stores the value of a key in an Apple iCloud-based container of "key-value" pairs. |





Remark: iCloud functions are intended to save data per application / per user (iCloud account) so that this data is synchronized and shared between the user's devices. To use these functions: 

- at runtime, enable the iCloud capability and update the provisioning profile in Xcode.

- in a test in simulator mode, these functions work as expected, but no data is saved.
