## Example


```wl
// Enable the notification request
GPSDetectPosition(DetectionProc, 1.145258, 30.968745)
```

```wl
// Procedure called during the notification
PROCEDURE DetectionProc(Enter is boolean)
IF Enter = True THEN
	Info("You have reached your destination.")
END
```

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = GPSDetectPosition(<WLanguage procedure> , <Latitude> , <Longitude> [, <Radius> [, <Timeout>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**

Detection identifier. 

This identifier is used in the following cases: 

- to stop the notification mechanism. Simply pass this identifier as a parameter to [GPSStopDetection](../WDLang3/1000019240.md).

- to identify the location processed in the WLanguage procedure called (case where the same WLanguage procedure is used to process several locations). 




**`<WLanguage procedure>: (Procedure name)`**

Name of the WLanguage procedure ("callback" procedure) called when the device enters into or exits from the region delimited by the specified parameters. 

For more details on this procedure, see [Parameters of the procedure used by GPSDetectPosition](../WDLang3/1000024683.md). 

**`<Latitude>: (Real)`**

Latitude of the proximity location.

**`<Longitude>: (Real)`**

Longitude of the proximity location.

**`<Radius>: (Optional real)`**

Radius (in meters), around the proximity location, from which the notification is to be generated. 

If this parameter is not specified, the radius around the location will be set to 50 meters.

**`<Timeout>: (Optional integer or optional Duration)`**

Timeout (in hundredths of a second) of the proximity alert. This timeout starts from the call to the function. 

- No timeout will be defined if this parameter is set to -1 or if it is not specified.

- If this timeout is specified, the notification mechanism will automatically stop at the end of the timeout.


This parameter can correspond to: 

- an integer corresponding to the number of hundredths of a second,

- a Duration variable,

- the duration in a readable format (e.g., 1 s or 10 ms).

## Remarks


### Special cases
<a name="special_cases_ELTPARAGRAPHE000100"></a>

- To stop receiving notifications, use [GPSEnd](../WDLang3/1000019210.md). 

- To stop detecting the proximity of a specific location;

	- return <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> in the associated WLanguage procedure, 

	- use the [GPSStopDetection](../WDLang3/1000019240.md) function. 




- You can detect the proximity to multiple locations by calling **GPSDetectPosition** for each location. If the same procedure is called for several locations, it is possible to differentiate these locations in the WLanguage procedure with the &lt;Detection identifier&gt; parameter. This parameter corresponds to the result of **GPSDetectPosition**.

- Location measurements can be more or less accurate depending on the parameters of the location provider. Therefore, it may happen that no notification is sent if the device briefly passes near the monitored area. Similarly, a notification may be received if the device comes very close to the monitored area without entering it.

### Required application feature
<a name="required_application_feature_ELTPARAGRAPHE000327"></a>

When this function is used, an application feature is declared in the application generation wizard.

Required feature: Geolocation

This feature allows the applications to access the geolocation features found on the device or on the computer.
