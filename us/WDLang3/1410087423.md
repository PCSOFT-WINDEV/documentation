	// Information message
	// Shows the user a message to explain 
	// why the application requires this permission
	Info("xxxx requires this permission")
	// Requests the permission
	PermissionRequest(Perm, ProcRequestPermission)
	INTERNAL PROCEDURE ProcRequestPermission(Perm is Permission)

### Requesting one permission

`PermissionRequest(<Permission> , <WLanguage procedure>)`
---

**`<Permission>: (Character string or Permission variable)`**

Name of the permission to request. This parameter can correspond to: 

- a character string with the following format: android.permission.&lt;NAME&gt;. The list of permissions of the Android SDK can be found at: [https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission).

- a variable of type [Permission](../WDLang3/1410087419.md).

- one of the following constants: 
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *permBackgroundLocation* | Permission to access the device's location when the application is running in the background.<br><br>Caution: This permission must be requested individually and after the *permLocation* or *permFineLocation* permissions are granted. |
| *permCamera* | Permission to access the device camera(s). |
| *permFineLocation* | Permission to access the device's precise location. |
| *permLocation* | Permission to access the device's location. |
| *permManageExternalStorage* | Permission to manage external storage. If this permission is requested, a system window will prompt the user to allow the application to access files on the external storage without restrictions. |
| *permReadContact* | Permission to read contacts. |
| *permReadPhoneState* | Permission to access phone information. |
| *permRecordAudio* | Permission to record audio streams. |
| *permSendSMS* | Permission to send SMSes. |
| *permWriteContact* | Permission to modify contacts. |
| *permWriteExternalStorage* | Permission to write on the external storage. |






**`<WLanguage procedure>: (Procedure name)`**

Name of the WLanguage procedure ("callback") called when the permission request is approved. This procedure has the following format: 

```txt
PROCEDURE <Procedure name>(<Result>)
```
where &lt;Result&gt; is a [Permission](../WDLang3/1410087419.md) variable. The result of the permission request is assigned to the **Granted** property.


<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Requesting multiple permissions simultaneously

`PermissionRequest(<Permissions> , <WLanguage procedure>)`
---

**`<Permissions>: (Array)`**

Requested permissions. This parameter can correspond to: 

- an array of strings in the following format: android.permission.&lt;NAME&gt;

- an array of [Permission](../WDLang3/1410087419.md) variables.




**`<WLanguage procedure>: (Procedure name)`**

Name of the WLanguage procedure ("callback") called when the permission request is approved. This procedure has the following format: 

```txt
PROCEDURE <Procedure name>(<Result>)
```
where &lt;Result&gt; is an array of [Permission](../WDLang3/1410087419.md) variables. For each permission, the result of the permission request is assigned to the **Granted** property.



<a name="NOTE0"></a>
<a name="NOTE0_1"></a>

## Remarks


- The *permLocationBackground* or "android.permission.ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION" permission must be requested individually and after the *permLocation* or *permFineLocation* permissions are granted.

- The permission must have been declared in the application manifest. Otherwise, a fatal error will occur.

- It is not necessary to call **PermissionRequest** for "normal" permissions (as opposed to "dangerous" permissions) because they are automatically granted when the application is installed, if they have been declared in the application manifest.

- For "dangerous" permissions (access to the location of the device, camera, microphone, etc.), the Android framework automatically requests the permission when a relevant feature is used. However, **PermissionRequest** can be used when, for example, you want to display an information message to the user before requesting a permission. 

- If the permission has already been granted, no window will be displayed.

- CAUTION: Since **PermissionRequest** can display a window for the user to approve the permission request, this function must be called from the main application thread.

- To get the list of permissions declared by the application, use [PermissionList](../WDLang3/1410087429.md).
