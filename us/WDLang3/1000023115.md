Used to find the Beacons near the device.

## Example


```wl
// In a museum, we want to display on the visitor device the information 
// regarding the masterpiece he is looking at. Associate to each Beacon 
// the same UUID corresponding to the museum as well as Major and Minor numbers 
// allowing each Beacon to be uniquely identified. 
// A Beacon is placed next to each work of art in the museum. 
// The application must call the BeaconDetectPrecise function with a 
// BeaconGroup variable corresponding to the museum tags. 
// The callback procedure passed as parameter to the function will be called whenever 
// a new list of Beacons is detected. Then, all you have to do is find 
// the nearest Beacon to identify the work the visitor is looking at and to display 
// the corresponding information in the application.

// Museum UUID
sUUID is string = "f4231ab6-5ef2-6c99-4229-af6c72e0446e"
// Create a beaconGroup variable corresponding to the museum tags
groupMuseum is beaconGroup
groupMuseum.UUID = sUUID
// Start the detection
BeaconDetectPrecise(groupMuseum, ProcDetection)
INTERNAL PROCEDURE ProcDetection(arrInfo is array of beaconDetectionInfo)
	nMinDistance is int 
	NearestBeacon is beaconDetectionInfo	
	FOR EACH Information of arrInfo
		IF nMinDistance = 0 _OR_ Information.Distance < nMinDistance
			NearestBeacon = Information
		END
	END
	// Display information about the masterpiece associated with the tag
	DisplayMasterpieceInfo(NearestBeacon.Major, NearestBeacon.Minor)
END
```

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = BeaconDetectPrecise(<Group of Beacons> , <WLanguage procedure>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the detection was started,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md).




**`<Group of Beacons>: (beaconGroup variable)`**

Name the of [beaconGroup](../WDLang3/1000023105.md) variable that describes the searched group of Beacons.

**`<WLanguage procedure>: (Procedure name)`**

Name of the WLanguage procedure ("callback") called when a new list of Beacons is detected. 

This procedure has the following format: 


```txt
PROCEDURE <Procedure Name>(<Array of Detection Info>)
```


where &lt;Array of detection info&gt; is a [beaconDetectionInfo](../WDLang3/1000023109.md) variable that describes the information about the detected Beacons (identifiers, Major/Minor numbers, distance, etc.)

## Remarks


- This function thoroughly studies Bluetooth emissions around the device to detect Beacons and to estimate how far they are. This study consumes a lot of energy: therefore, it is recommended to call this function only if there is at least one nearby Beacon. 
	To do so, you can call [BeaconDetectBackground](../WDLang3/1000023112.md) then **BeaconDetectPrecise** from the callback procedure run when the application detected the entry in the Beacon transmission range. 
	Furthermore, we advise you to stop the precise detection as soon as possible. [BeaconStopPreciseDetection](../WDLang3/1000023116.md) is used to stop the current detection: it can for example be called in the WLanguage procedure run when the application detects the exit from the transmission range of the beacons.

- The precise detection of Beacons is performed only when the application is in the foreground. When the application goes into background, the detection is automatically suspended and it will resume as soon as the application goes back into foreground. The detection is permanently stopped when the application is stopped. To perform a detection in background, use [BeaconDetectBackground](../WDLang3/1000023112.md).

- Several precise detections cannot be started at the same time. If **BeaconDetectPrecise** is called while a detection is already in progress, the current detection will be stopped and a new detection will be started.
