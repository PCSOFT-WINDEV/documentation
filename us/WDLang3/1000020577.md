The **wsRequest** type is used to define the advanced characteristics of a Webservice. This type of variable is mainly used to define the HTTP headers used by a Webservice. EBay and SharePoint Webservices require this type of HTTP headers. 

**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).
