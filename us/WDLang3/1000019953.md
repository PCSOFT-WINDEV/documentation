## Example


```wl
// Start movement tracking in the Map control
MapFollowMovement(MAP_Position)
```

<a name="XSYNTAX"></a>

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = MapFollowMovement(<Map control> [, <Compass> [, <WLanguage procedure>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the following of movement was enabled,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md).




**`<Map control>: (Control name)`**

Name of the Map control to be used. If this parameter corresponds to an empty string (""), the Map control to which the current event belongs will be used.

**`<Compass>: (Optional boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> to enable the compass. A compass is displayed in the Map control to indicate the orientation of the move. This option is available for the devices equipped with an orientation sensor. 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> (default value) to disable the compass. 




**`<WLanguage procedure>: (Procedure name)`**

Name of the WLanguage procedure ("callback") called each time a movement notification is received. This procedure has the following format: 

```txt
PROCEDURE <Procedure name> (<Position>)
```

where &lt;Position&gt; is a variable of type [geoPosition](../WDLang3/1000019191.md) that contains information about the device's location at the time of the notification. 

The parameters of this procedure are optional. There is no need to pass parameters to this procedure. Indeed, these parameters are automatically filled during each call.

If this procedure returns <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>, the map displayed in the Map control will not be refreshed. 

If this parameter is not specified, whenever a change of device position is notified, the map displayed in the Map control is automatically centered on the new position.

## Remarks


### Special cases
<a name="special_cases_ELTPARAGRAPHE000121"></a>

- To stop following the move, use [MapEndOfMove](../WDLang3/1000019949.md).

- A blue circle may appear around the marker, indicating the current position of the device. This circle is a representation of the level of precision regarding the position. The more it is extended, less precise the position will be. To define the location of the device, the function uses two types of "location providers": 

	- the network of GPS satellites, 

	- the triangulation performed from the network of mobile and Wi-Fi antennas.


 The location provider depends on the location settings of the device when the function is called

- A certain amount of time may elapse between the call to **MapFollowMovement** and the actual display of the device location on the map. This time corresponds to the time taken by the location provider (GPS or mobile/Wi-Fi network) to define the current location of the device. Once this position is found, the map control is automatically centered on this one.

### Required application feature
<a name="required_application_feature_ELTPARAGRAPHE000162"></a>

When this function is used, an application feature is declared in the application generation wizard.

Required feature: Geolocation

This feature allows applications to use the geolocation features of the device.
