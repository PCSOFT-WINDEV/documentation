## Example


```wl
gMqttSession is mqttSession
llResult is int
sTopic is string
bufContent is Buffer

gMqttSession.Address = "xxx.xx.xxx.xxx" // To fill
gMqttSession.Port = 1883
gMqttSession.ClientID = "MyTest"
gMqttSession.CleanSession = True

sTopic = "/SERVER"
bufContenu = "Test from WINDEV"

IF NOT gMqttSession.Connect() THEN
	Error("Connection problem. '" + ErrorInfo() + "')")
END

llResult = gMqttSession.Publish(sTopic, bufContent)
```

```wl
gMqttSession is mqttSession
...
llResult is int
sTopic = "/SERVER"
bufContenu = "Test from WINDEV"
llResult = gMqttSession.Publish(sTopic, bufContent, True, ...
	mqttQualityExactlyOnce, PublicationMQTT)

INTERNAL PROCEDURE PublicationMQTT(pMqttSession is mqttSession, MessageNum is int)
Trace("Publication" + " - MessageNum = " + MessageNum)
END
```

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`<Result> = <MQTT session>.Publish(<Topic> , <Data> [, <To store> [, <Quality of service> [, <Procedure>]]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**



- Number of published message (*mqttQualityExactlyOnce* and *mqttQualityAtLeastOnce* constants). 

- 0 if the publication is successful (*mqttQualityAtMostOnce* constant). 

- -1 if an error occurred.




**`<MQTT session>: (mqttSession variable)`**

Name of the [mqttSession](../WDLang3/1000023023.md) variable corresponding to the MQTT session to be used.

**`<Topic>: (Character string)`**

Message topic.

**`<Data>: (Buffer)`**

Data to publish (must not exceed 256MB).

**`<To store>: (Optional boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the message must be stored on the server. 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> (by default) otherwise.




**`<Quality of service>: (Optional integer)`**

Requested service quality: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *mqttQualityAtLeastOnce* | The message will be delivered at least once. The client will transmit the message several times if necessary until the server (broker) confirms that the message was transmitted on the network.<br><br>Equivalent to QOS set to 1. |
| *mqttQualityAtMostOnce* | The message will be delivered once at most. The message is not stored. It is sent without guarantee of receipt. The MQTT (broker) does not inform the sender that the message was received. The message can be lost if the client is disconnected or if the server is stopped. <br><br>Equivalent to QOS set to 0. |
| *mqttQualityExactlyOnce* | The message will be necessarily saved by the issuer. It will be transmitted as long as the receiver does not confirm its sending on the network. The issuer is using a sophisticated recognition with the server (broker) to avoid duplicating messages. This mode is slower but it is more secure.<br><br>Equivalent to QOS set to 2. |



**`<Procedure>: (Name of optional WLanguage procedure)`**

Name of WLanguage procedure ("callback") run when the message was published (this procedure is called if the *mqttQualityExactlyOnce* and *mqttQualityAtLeastOnce* constants are used). This procedure has the following format:

```txt
PROCEDURE <Procedure name>(<Session> is mqttSession, 
<Message num> is int)
```
where: 

- &lt;Session&gt; corresponds to a [mqttSession](../WDLang3/1000023023.md) variable containing the characteristics of MQTT session. 

- &lt;Message num&gt; corresponds to the number of published message.
