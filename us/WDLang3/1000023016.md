Defines the number of levels to display in the time scale of a chart as well as the maximum level.

Remark: This function can be used with [grTimeLevelMask](../WDLang3/1000023017.md), which defines the mask of a level in the time scale of the chart.

**`<Chart name>: (Control name or character string)`**

Name of the chart to be used. This name corresponds to:

- the chart name defined through programming with [grCreate](../WDLang3/3042005.md).

- the name of the Chart control in the window or page editor.




**`<Number of levels>: (Integer)`**

Maximum number of levels displayed in the chart. 

**`<Maximum level>: (Optional Integer constant)`**

Maximum level to display: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *grtlDay* | Maximum level displayed: days. |
| *grtlHour* | Maximum level displayed: hours. |
| *grtlMillisecond* | Maximum level displayed: milliseconds. |
| *grtlMinute* | Maximum level displayed: minutes. |
| *grtlMonth* | Maximum level displayed: months. |

## Remarks
When displaying a time scale on DateTime data, the chart designer draws several levels corresponding to the different time units displayed. 

- The minimum level to display is defined according to the range of data.

- The maximum level is defined by using two parameters:

	- The maximum number of levels to display in the chart (by default: 3). 

	- The maximum level allowed for the display (by default: year).





**grTimeLevelMax** is used to modify these parameters. This allows you not to overload the chart or not to display some levels without relevance for the data displayed.

For example: 

- to avoid displaying the years, all you have to do is set the maximum level with the *grtlMonth* constant.

- to avoid displaying more than two time levels in the chart, all you have to do is set the &lt;Number of Levels&gt; parameter to 2.
