### Finding out the current activation status of Bluetooth on the device

`<Result> = BTLEStatus()`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer constant)`**

Bluetooth LE activation status: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *btActivationInProgress* | The Bluetooth is being enabled on the device. |
| *btDeactivationInProgress* | The Bluetooth is being disabled on the device. |
| *btDisabled* | The Bluetooth is disabled on the device. |

### Enabling the notification whenever Bluetooth activation changes

`BTLEStatus(<WLanguage procedure>)`
---

**`<WLanguage procedure>: (Procedure name)`**

Name of the WLangage procedure ("callback" procedure) that will be called when the Bluetooth activation status changes on the device. This procedure has the following format : 


```txt
PROCEDURE <Procedure name> (<New status>, <Former status>)
```
where: 

- &lt;New Status&gt; is an integer corresponding ot the new activation status of Bluetooth on the device. 

- &lt;Former status&gt; is an integer corresponding to the activation status of Bluetooth on the device before changing status.


These integers correspond to the following constants: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *btActivationInProgress* | The Bluetooth is being enabled on the device. |
| *btDeactivationInProgress* | The Bluetooth is being disabled on the device. |
| *btDisabled* | The Bluetooth is disabled on the device. |
| *btEnabled* | The Bluetooth is enabled on the device. |

The parameters of this procedure are optional. There is no need to pass parameters to this procedure. Indeed, these parameters are automatically filled during each call.

**If this parameter corresponds to an empty string ("")**, the notifications will not be sent anymore when the status changes. The function has no effect if no notification request was performed.
