## Principle
<a name="principle_ELTTEXTE000272"></a>
There are two methods to handle emails in WLanguage: 

- the [Email](../WDLang3/3032029.md) structure, which allows you to easily handle messages. 
	In this case, to write an email, you must use the different variables of Email structure. 

- the advanced [Email](../WDLang3/1000018713.md) type, which offers advanced functionalities (data binding, serialization, multiple instances, etc.). 
	In this case, to write an email, you must declare and initialize a variable of type [Email](../WDLang3/1000018713.md). The possible attachments will be declared in the [emailAttach](../WDLang3/1000018752.md) variables and added to the **Attach** property of the [Email](../WDLang3/1000018713.md) variable.




When sending the message ([EmailSendMessage](../WDLang3/3032005.md)), the data found in the email variable or structure will constitute the outgoing message.

## Steps to follow

### Writing an email with an Email variable
<a name="writing_email_with_email_variable_ELTPARAGRAPHE000072"></a>

To write an email with an Email variable: 

1. Declare and initialize a variable of type [Email](../WDLang3/1000018713.md) by specifying the recipients and subject with the **Recipient**, **Cc**, **Bcc** and **Subject** properties, for example. 
	To manage a conversation follow-up, specify the **MessageID** property as well.

2. **If the email is in text format**:

	- Initialize the **Message** property with the text of the email.

	- Specify the attached files if necessary by declaring variables of type [emailAttach](../WDLang3/1000018752.md) and adding them to the **Attach** property of the variable representing the email.




3. **If the email is in HTML format**: Use [EmailImportHTML](../WDLang3/3032038.md) to initialize the properties of the email. If the email contains images or media files, they will be automatically added in attachment and the content of HTML email will be modified to support the attachments.
	![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) [EmailImportHTML](../WDLang3/3032038.md) is not available. You must use the method that is using the Email structure presented below.

4. Specify additional headers if necessary via the **Header** property. 

5. Send the email with [EmailSendMessage](../WDLang3/3032005.md). If the subject (or one of the email elements) contains special characters or accented characters, use the **emailOptionEncodeHeader** constant when the message is sent by [EmailSendMessage](../WDLang3/3032005.md). The email is sent to the server. The server stores the email until the session is closed. During this closing, the email is actually sent to the recipients.




![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) **Remark**: To follow the progress of email sending, use [EmailProgressBar](../WDLang3/3032017.md).

### Writing an email with the Email structure
<a name="writing_email_with_the_email_structure_ELTPARAGRAPHE000120"></a>

To write an email with the Email structure: 

1. Initialize the [Email](../WDLang3/3032029.md) structure by specifying the recipients and subject with the Email.Recipient, Email.NbRecipient, Email.NbCc, Email.Cc and Email.Subject variables, for example. 
	To follow the progress of conversion, fill Email.MessageID.

2. **If the email is in HTML format**:

	- **1st case: EmailImportHTML is available:**

		- Use [EmailImportHTML](../WDLang3/3032038.md) to initialize the different variables of Email structure. 




- **2nd case: EmailImportHTML is not available:**

	- Initialize the Email.Message and Email.HTML variables. 
						Remark: We recommend that you use a message in text format for the messaging systems that do not support the emails in HTML format.

	- Analyze the HTML message to detect all media files included in the message.

	- For each media file found:

		- Create an attached file. This attached file corresponds to the multimedia file (Email.Attach and Email.NbAttach variables).

		- Create an identifier (Email.AttachIdentifier). This identifier must have the following format ***"wdcid"+number of attached file***. For example, WDCID5 if the corresponding file is the fifth attached file.

		- Search for the media file in the HTML message and replace its name by the string: ***"cid:"+Email.AttachIdentifier***.
										For example: 
										Initial HTML code: &lt;IMG src="C:\\MyImages\\Image.gif"&gt;
										Replaced HTML code: &lt;IMG src="cid:WDCID5"&gt;

3. Send the email with [EmailSendMessage](../WDLang3/3032005.md). 
	Remark: If the subject (or one of the email elements) contains special characters or accented characters, use the **emailOptionEncodeHeader** constant when the message is sent by [EmailSendMessage](../WDLang3/3032005.md).

### Example that uses EmailImportHTML
<a name="example_that_uses_emailimporthtml_ELTPARAGRAPHE000178"></a>

This example is used to send an email containing images:


```wl
// Start an SMTP session
MySession is emailSMTPSession
MySession.ServerAddress = "smtp.mycompany.com"
EmailStartSession(MySession)

// Build the message
MyMessage is Email
MyHTMLText = fLoadText("C:\Email\MyEmail.htm")

EmailImportHTML(MyMessage, MyHTMLText, "C:\Email")

MyMessage.Recipient = "bob@mycompany.net"
MyMessage.Subject = "Test"

// Send the message
EmailSendMessage(MySession, MyMessage, emailOptionEncodeHeader)
```

<a name="NOTE3_2"></a>


### Example that uses the Email structure
<a name="example_that_uses_the_email_structure_ELTPARAGRAPHE000187"></a>

This example is used to replace the references to the media files (images, sounds, ...) found in the Email.HTML variable by their "CID" identifiers. This procedure is called for each file found.


```wl
PROCEDURE SetAttachFile(FileName, Subscript)
Email.Attach[Subscript] = FileName
Email.NbAttach ++

// Replace in Email.HTML all references to the attached files 
// by the cid identifier
CID is string = "cid:wdcid" + Subscript

// The HTML file was not necessarily created in the current directory
// It can reference the attached files in any path
// Therefore, extract the file name without path

SimpleName is string = fExtractPath(FileName, fFile + fExtension)

// Find the name of the file in Email.HTML
Pos is int = 0
StartPos, EndPos are int
SubString is string
Pos = Position(Email.html, SimpleName, Pos)
IF Pos <> 0 THEN
	EndPos = Pos + Length(SimpleName)
	// Find the start position of reference
	// Find the " marker
	Pos --
	SubString = Email.HTML[[Pos]]
	WHILE Pos > 1 AND SubString <> """"
	   Pos --
	   SubString = Email.HTML[[Pos]]
	END
	StartPos = Pos + 1
	// Replace
	SubString = Middle(Email.HTML, StartPos, EndPos - StartPos)
	Email.HTML = Replace(Email.HTML, SubString, CID)
END
```

## Using the EML format to customize emails
<a name="using_the_eml_format_customize_emails_ELTTEXTE000356"></a>
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png)![User code (UMC)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/MCU.png) In some cases, the structure of outgoing emails may not correspond to the requested information.

For example: 

- The communication with some organizations (emails for SESAM-VITALE) may require specific structures.

- You may also want to force a specific character set (for a non-Latin language).

- You may want to specify a return address that differs from the sender address.




To customize these emails, WLanguage allows you to create the buffer of the email, to modify it and to send this email.

The following functions are used: 

- [EmailImportSource](../WDLang3/1000017226.md): This functions is used to read an existing EML file and to automatically fill the variables of the Email structure.

- [EmailBuildSource](../WDLang3/1000017225.md): This function is used to generate the source code of an email. This function allows you to entirely define the source code of email by using the flexibility of Email structure.

- [EmailSend](../WDLang3/3032003.md): This functions sends a "buffer" in EML format containing the structured email (created by [EmailBuildSource](../WDLang3/1000017225.md) for example).
