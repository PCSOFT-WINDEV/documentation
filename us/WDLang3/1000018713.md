The **Email** type is used to handle the email content as well as the associated information. The characteristics of an email can be defined and changed using different WLanguage properties.

This type replaces and extends the [Email](../WDLang3/3032029.md) structure by giving you the ability to handle several messages at the same time.

**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

## Example


```wl
// Send an email

// Build the message
MyMessage is Email

// Sender
MyMessage.Sender = sSender

// Recipients
sRecipient_1 is string = "aaa@gmail.com"
sRecipient_2 is string = "bbb@gmail.com"
Add(MyMessage.Recipient, sRecipient_1)
Add(MyMessage.Recipient, sRecipient_2)


// Message content
MyMessage.Subject = EDT_Subject
MyMessage.Message = RTFToText(sNote)
MyMessage.HTML = RTFToHTML(sNote)

// Start an SMTP session
MySession is emailSMTPSession
MySession.ServerAddress = sServer
IF EmailStartSession(MySession) = False THEN RETURN

// Send the message (the emailOptionEncodeHeader constant is used to
// take the accented characters into account)
EmailSendMessage(MySession, MyMessage, emailOptionEncodeHeader)

// Close the session
EmailCloseSession(MySession)
