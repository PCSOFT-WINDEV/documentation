**`<Result>: (Array of Appointment variables)`**

Array of [Appointment](../WDLang1/1000019244.md) variables initialized with the list of appointments corresponding to the specified criteria. 

If an error occurred, the array is empty and the [ErrorOccurred](../WDLang1/3087001.md) variable is set to <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md).

- If &lt;Start&gt; and &lt;End&gt; are not specified, only the future appointments will be listed (from today's date and time). 

- If only &lt;Start&gt; is specified, all the appointments found after this date will be retrieved (the limit date is set to 01/01/2031).

- If &lt;Start&gt; must not be specified and if at least one of the following parameters must be specified, use an empty string ("").




**Remark**: If only the date is specified (without specifying the hours, minutes and seconds), the events will be taken into account from the specified date at 0 hour 0 minute 0 second.

**`<End>: (Optional DateTime)`**
