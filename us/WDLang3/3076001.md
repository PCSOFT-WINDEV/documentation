## Steps to follow

To manage the outgoing calls in a WINDEV application:

1. Define (if necessary) the TAPI device on which the calls must be dialed. Use the functions:
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [tapiCapability](../WDLang3/3076014.md) | Returns the characteristics of a telephony device. |
| [tapiDevice](../WDLang3/3076032.md) | Selects the TAPI device that will be used during the following telephony operations: <br><br>	- [tapiDial](../WDLang3/3076013.md),<br><br>	- [tapiListen](../WDLang3/3076029.md).<br><br><br> |
| [tapiDeviceList](../WDLang3/3076024.md) | Lists the TAPI 2.0 and TAPI 3.1 compatible devices installed on the current computer. |

2. Dial the phone number via the modem ([tapiDial](../WDLang3/3076013.md)).

3. This function calls a specific WLanguage procedure used to manage the progress of the call. In this procedure, the following variables enable you to find out the status of the line:

	- *tapiLineBusy*: The line is currently busy. 

	- *tapiLineConnected*: The line is connected

	- *tapiLineDialing*: Dialing in progress

	- *tapiLineDialTone*: The line gets a dial tone

	- *tapiLineDisconnected*: The correspondent has hung up

	- *tapiLineProceeding*: The call is dialed: searching for the correspondent

	- *tapiLineRingBack*: Ringing in progress




4. Pick up the phone receiver to communicate.

5. During the communication, the WLanguage functions for handling the call can be used (see below). There is no need to specify the identifier of the call because the call processed will be the current call (which means the outgoing call).

6. At the end of the call, close the line with [tapiHangUp](../WDLang3/3076030.md).

7. Hang up the phone receiver.

## Handling an outgoing call
<a name="handling_outgoing_call_ELTTEXTE000146"></a>
The following operations can be performed on the outgoing calls:

- finding out the characteristics of the outgoing call:
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [tapiCallDuring](../WDLang3/3076004.md) | Returns the duration of the call (difference between the start date and time of call and the end date and time of call). |
| [tapiCalledID](../WDLang3/3076025.md) | Used to find out the phone number called. |
| [tapiCallEnd](../WDLang3/3076002.md) | Returns the date and time of the end of call. |
| [tapiCallerID](../WDLang3/3076010.md) | Used to find out the calling phone number (the one that calls). |
| [tapiCallIsBusy](../WDLang3/3076017.md) | Used to find out whether the number called is busy. |
| [tapiCallIsOver](../WDLang3/3076003.md) | Used to find out whether the incoming or outgoing call is ended. |
| [tapiCallStart](../WDLang3/3076006.md) | Returns the date and time of the beginning of call (incoming or outgoing call). |
| [tapiNoAnswer](../WDLang3/3076008.md) | Used to find out whether an answer was given to the call. |

- perform specific operations:
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [tapiKeyPressed](../WDLang3/3076027.md) | Returns the history of the keys pressed on the phone keypad since the last call to tapiKeyPressed. |
| [tapiPlay](../WDLang3/3076023.md) | Plays a sound file (.WAV) for the specified line. |
| [tapiRecord](../WDLang3/3076019.md) | Records the current communication as a".WAV" file. |
| [tapiSendKey](../WDLang3/3076018.md) | Allows you to simulate the use of phone keys. |
| [tapiStop](../WDLang3/3076007.md) | Stops reading a pre-recorded message ([tapiPlay](../WDLang3/3076023.md)). |
