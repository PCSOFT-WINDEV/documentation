| Constant | Description | Used by the functions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ftpAccess** | Type of date/time: Date/Time of the last access to the file | [FTPDate](../WDLang3/3040015.md), <br>[FTPTime](../WDLang3/3040013.md) |
| **ftpActiveMode** | **Active connection** to the FTP server. <br><br>When transferring files, the client starts the transfer. This type of connection may be refused by some protected FTP servers. | [FTPConnect](../WDLang3/3040016.md) |
| **ftpASCIIMode** | File transfer performed in ASCII mode: This mode is used to transfer data between two different types of operating systems, from UNIX to Windows for example: the transferred file is changed into the ASCII format of destination system. | [FTPSend](../WDLang3/3040014.md), <br>[FTPGet](../WDLang3/3040002.md) |
| **ftpBinaryMode** | File transfer performed in binary mode: the file received is exactly identical to the file sent | [FTPSend](../WDLang3/3040014.md), <br>[FTPGet](../WDLang3/3040002.md) |
| **ftpCreation** | Type of date/time: Date/Time of file creation | [FTPDate](../WDLang3/3040015.md), <br>[FTPTime](../WDLang3/3040013.md) |
| **ftpDirectory** | Element to find: search performed on the directories only | [FTPListFile](../WDLang3/3040018.md) |
| **ftpErrorAuthentification** | Notifies a connection error caused by an identification problem | [FTPConnect](../WDLang3/3040016.md) |
| **ftpExtendedPassiveMode** | **Extended passive connection** to the FTP server (EPSV mode). <br><br>When transferring files, the server takes the initiative for the transfer. This type of connection is used to step over some "firewalls". <br><br><br><br>If the server does not support the extended passive mode (the FEAT command is sent to the server to find out the capacity), the connection is crippled in simple passive mode. | [FTPConnect](../WDLang3/3040016.md) |
| **ftpFile** | Element to find: search performed on the files only | [FTPListFile](../WDLang3/3040018.md) |
| **ftpIgnoreExpiredCertificate** | The certificate date is ignored. | [FTPConnect](../WDLang3/3040016.md) |
| **ftpIgnoreInvalidCertificate** | The certificate is ignored. | [FTPConnect](../WDLang3/3040016.md) |
| **ftpIgnoreInvalidCertificateName** | The site name specified in the certificate is ignored. | [FTPConnect](../WDLang3/3040016.md) |
| **ftpIgnoreRevocation** | The certificate revocation is ignored. | [FTPConnect](../WDLang3/3040016.md) |
| **ftpModification** | Type of date/time: Date/Time of the last modification made to the file | [FTPDate](../WDLang3/3040015.md), <br>[FTPTime](../WDLang3/3040013.md) |
| **ftpParameterMode** | Selects the FTP operating mode. Two modes are available:<br><br>- the functions for FTP management use the "wininet" module of Windows. This mode corresponds to the default operating mode of FTP functions.<br><br>- the functions for FTP management use an module independent of Windows and support the UTF8. Caution: In this mode, [FTPCommand](../WDLang3/3040017.md) is not supported.<br><br><br> | [FTPParameter](../WDLang3/1000020947.md) |
| **ftpPassiveMode** | **Passive connection** to the FTP server (PASV mode). <br><br>When transferring files, the server takes the initiative for the transfer. This type of connection is used to step over some "firewalls".<br><br><br><br>Remark: If the connection to the server is in IPV6, the connection will be performed in extended passive mode (because the passive mode does not support IPV6). | [FTPConnect](../WDLang3/3040016.md) |
| **ftpPassiveModeIgnoreIP** | **Passive connection** to the FTP server (PASV mode). <br><br>When transferring files in passive mode, the server sets the port and IP address for data transfer. With this parameter, only the port is taken into account. The IP address is ignored.<br>This type of connection allows the use of FTP servers that return non-routable IP addresses but are reachable via the connection IP address | [FTPConnect](../WDLang3/3040016.md) |
| **ftpProxyNone** | Allows to cancel the use of the FTP proxy. | [FTPProxy](../WDLang3/1000019366.md) |
| **ftpProxyOpen** | Type of proxy to use: FTP proxy requiring the "OPEN" command. | [FTPProxy](../WDLang3/1000019366.md) |
| **ftpProxySite** | Type of proxy to use: FTP proxy requiring the "SITE" command. | [FTPProxy](../WDLang3/1000019366.md) |
| **ftpProxySOCKS5** | FTP proxy using the SOCKS5 protocol. | [FTPProxy](../WDLang3/1000019366.md) |
| **ftpProxyUserSeparate** | Type of proxy to use: FTP proxy requiring the "USER" command and the "PASS" command separately. | [FTPProxy](../WDLang3/1000019366.md) |
| **ftpProxyUserTogether** | Type of proxy to use: FTP proxy requiring the "USER" command with the user and the password. | [FTPProxy](../WDLang3/1000019366.md) |
| **tpesParameterSecureMode** | Changes FTPES encryption. Two modes are available: <br><br>- SSL encryption is applied to FTP data and commands. This is the default mode for functions in FTPES.<br><br>- SSL encryption is applied only to FTP commands. This mode may be required for some FTPES servers.<br><br><br> | [FTPParameter](../WDLang3/1000020947.md) |
