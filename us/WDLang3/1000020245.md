The **SIPAddress** type is used to define the advanced characteristics of a SIP address. SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) is a standardized protocol used to establish multimedia communications (sound and images). It is mainly used for VoIP (voice on IP).

The characteristics of this SIP address can be defined and modified by several WLanguage properties. 

This type of variable is used by the [Contact](../WDLang3/1000020254.md) variables.

**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).
