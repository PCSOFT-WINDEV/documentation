	<B><B>Warning</B></B>

	 The email structure is kept for backward compatibility, and to be used in PHP. In most cases, it is recommended to use a variable of type [Email](../WDLang3/1000018713.md). 

<a name="NOTE1"></a>
<a name="NOTE1_1"></a>


## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000782"></a>
The email structure is a preset structure of WLanguage (no declaration is required). This structure is used to:

- create an email,

- retrieve the content of emails.




To reset all variables of Email structure to zero, use [EmailReset](../WDLang3/3032023.md).

The Email structure proposes a simple method for handling an email. You also have the ability to use the advanced types for handling emails:

- [Email](../WDLang3/1000018713.md) variable.

- [emailAttach](../WDLang3/1000018752.md) variable.




These advanced types allow you to:

- handle several emails simultaneously.

- use [Serialize](../WDLang1/3013065.md)/[Deserialize](../WDLang1/3013066.md) on the email.

- use the [Data binding](../Editeurs/2022051.md).

- use the FOR ALL loops on the email sessions.

- ...

**Advanced management of emails** (SMTP mode only): To perform an advanced description of the emails, you have the ability to access the MIME Content-Type and Content-Description controls for each attachment supplied with the email.

The corresponding variables are as follows:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| Email.AttachContentDescription | SMTP mode only<br><br>Array of strings corresponding to the content of MIME Content-description control of each attached file. The number of attached files is unlimited. |

These variables are accessible in read-only when receiving an email and in read/write when sending an email.

**Remarks**: 

- If Email.Message and Email.HTML are empty and if the email has a single attachment, the MIME content-Type and Content-description controls will correspond to the characteristics of the attached file.




- You can use non-Latin characters in the following variables: 

	- Email.Subject

	- Email.Message

	- Email.Keywords

	- Email.SenderAddress

	- Email.Sender

	- Email.ID


 In this case, use the **emailOptionEncodeHeader** constant when the message is sent by [EmailSendMessage](../WDLang3/3032005.md).



<a name="NOTE2_2"></a>


### Acknowledgement of receipt
<a name="acknowledgement_receipt_ELTPARAGRAPHE000560"></a>

Two variables can be used to managed an acknowledgment of receipt: ***Email.DispositionNotification*** and ***Email.ReturnReceipt***.

Some email software only recognize ***Email.DispositionNotification***, other recognize both variables and perform specific operations according to the variable used. 

***Email.DispositionNotification*** is the most recognized variable while ***Email.ReturnReceipt*** is less and less recognized.

To remain compatible with the email software that use the second variable, the 2 variables are kept and differentiated. We recommend that you use these two variables (the main variable being ***Email.DispositionNotification***).
<a name="NOTE2_3"></a>


### Variables of the email structure that belong to the email header
<a name="variables_the_email_structure_that_belong_the_email_header_ELTPARAGRAPHE000573"></a>

When reading the header of the email, the email structure is automatically updated according to the content of the message header.
The following variables are empty:

- Email.Message

- Email.Attach

- Email.NbAttach

- Email.HTML

- Email.PlainText


These variables require a full reading of the message ([EmailReadMessage](../WDLang3/3032016.md)). The Email.Bcc and Email.NbBcc variables can only be used to send emails.

<a name="NOTE3"></a>
<a name="NOTE3_1"></a>
