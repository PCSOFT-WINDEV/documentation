Starts a session for receiving and reading emails with the POP3 protocol. You will only be able to read the emails. You have the ability to start a POP3 session secured via SSL.

**Remark**: To start a session for sending emails, use [EmailStartSMTPSession](../WDLang3/3032025.md).

## Example


```wl
// Read an email via the POP3 protocol
IF EmailStartPOP3Session(USER, PASSWORD, "pop3.supplier.com") = True THEN 
	UserName = USER
ELSE
	UserName = ""
	Error("Unable to establish the connection")
END
```

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![User code (UMC)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/MCU.png) 
```wl
// Connection to a POP3 server that requires an SSL connection (gMail for example) 
// 995 is the standard port for this type of service
EmailStartPOP3Session(EDT_SESSION, EDT_PWD, EDT_POP, 995, optionSSL)

// Connection to a non-secured POP server
EmailStartPOP3Session(EDT_SESSION, EDT_PWD, EDT_POP, 110)
// 110 is the standard port for this type of service. 
// It is also the default value of the function, 
// Therefore we could also write
EmailStartPOP3Session(EDT_SESSION, EDT_PWD, EDT_POP)
```

## Syntax

`<Result> = EmailStartPOP3Session(<Username> , <Password> , <Address of POP3 server> [, <Number of POP3 port> [, <Option>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the session was started, 

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. If an error occurs, the [ErrorOccurred](../WDLang1/3087001.md) variable is set to <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>. 
	To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) with the *errMessage* constant.




**`<Username>: (Character string)`**

Identifies the user. This name is supplied by the service provider or by the network administrator. This name will be used to identify the email session in the different functions for email management.

**`<Password>: (Character string)`**

User password. This password is given by the service provider or by the network administrator.

**`<Address of POP3 server>: (Character string)`**

IP address of email server (incoming protocol). This IP address is supplied by the service provider or by the network administrator. This IP address can have the following format:

- IP address in XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX format (125.5.110.100 for example).

- IP address containing the server name (pop3.freesbee.eu for example). This syntax is recommended.

- IP address returned by [NetIPAddress](../WDLang3/3056023.md).




**`<Number of POP3 port>: (Optional integer)`**

Identifies the port used for the POP3 protocol (110 by default).

**`<Option>: (Optional Integer constant)`**

Used to specify whether an SSL connection is required:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *optionSSL* | SSL connection required (for a secure POP3 server).<br><br>**Remark**: in most cases, the port used for a secure POP3 server is 995 (instead of 110, the default port value).<br><br>![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) Constant not available. |

## Remarks


### POP3 protocol
<a name="pop3_protocol_ELTPARAGRAPHE000113"></a>

- The different parameters passed to **EmailStartPOP3Session** are supplied by the Internet Service Provider or by the network administrator. An Internet connection is required to manage the emails. Several cases may occur:

	- The user uses a modem to connect to Internet: [NetOpenRemoteAccess](../WDLang3/3056026.md) establishes the Internet connection.

	- The user uses a direct connection to Internet (cable or ADSL): no specific operation is required.




- The POP3 protocol can only be used to read emails. A WLanguage error occurs if you try to send emails without starting an SMTP session ([EmailStartSMTPSession](../WDLang3/3032025.md)). 
	To start a POP3 session and an SMTP session at the same time, use [EmailStartSession](../WDLang3/3032028.md).

- The incoming emails are the ones received when starting the session. All the emails received once the session is started are not accessible. To access the new incoming emails, the POP3 session must be closed and re-started.

### Session and username
<a name="session_and_username_ELTPARAGRAPHE000138"></a>

After starting a POP3 session, you can start an SMTP session ([EmailStartSMTPSession](../WDLang3/3032025.md)) with the same username.
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Timeout
<a name="timeout_ELTPARAGRAPHE000148"></a>

The timeout can be set using [EmailSetTimeOut](../WDLang3/3032001.md).

![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) 

### Required application feature
<a name="required_application_feature_ELTPARAGRAPHE000162"></a>

When this function is used, an application feature is declared in the application generation wizard.

Required feature: Family and corporate networks

This feature allows the applications to use incoming and outgoing accesses to the family and corporate networks.

### Gmail: What to do if a connection to Gmail (SMTP, IMAP, POP3) fails with a certificate error?
<a name="gmail_what_connection_gmail_smtp_imap_pop3_fails_with_certificate_error_ELTPARAGRAPHE000312"></a>

Since August 2017, a new certificate was deployed by Google: Google Internet Authority G3. Unfortunately, the Windows API for checking certificates does not validate this certificate.

Therefore, starting a POP3, IMAP or SMTP session may fail with the error "The certificate string was not issued by a trusted authority".

To validate the certificate, all you have to do is modify the management mode of emails. The WLanguage [EmailConfigure](../WDLang3/1000022269.md) function allows you to change this mode and to no longer use the Windows API that locks this certificate. The following code must be added before starting the session via **EmailStartPOP3Session**:

```wl
// Enable the multi-platform implementation
EmailConfigure(emailParameterMode, 1)
```


Remark: From version 23 Update 1, the call to [EmailConfigure](../WDLang3/1000022269.md) is not required anymore: WLanguage is automatically using the management mode of emails adapted to the session.
