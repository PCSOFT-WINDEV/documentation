## Syntax

`<Result> = FTPSend(<Connection identifier> , <File/Directory to Transfer> , <Destination file/directory> [, <WLanguage procedure> [, <Transfer mode>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the transfer was performed,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. The error status report is returned by [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md).




**`<Connection identifier>: (Integer)`**

Connection identifier, returned by [FTPConnect](../WDLang3/3040016.md).


**`<File/Directory to Transfer>: (Character string)`**

Name and full (or relative) path of the file (or directory) to transfer. A UNC path can be used. No wildcard character can be used (\* or?).
***If this parameter corresponds to a directory***, all the files found in this directory are transferred. A directory with the same name is created on the FTP server at the location specified by &lt;Destination File/Directory&gt;.
***If this parameter corresponds to a file***:

- If &lt;Destination File/Directory&gt; is a directory found on the FTP server, the file to retrieve is copied into the destination directory.

- If &lt;Destination File/Directory&gt; is a file found on the FTP server, the file to transfer is copied and renamed.




**`<Destination file/directory>: (Character string)`**

Name and full (or relative) path of destination file (or directory). This file (or directory) is found on the FTP server. The different path sections are separated by "slashes" ("/").
A full path has the following format: "/&lt;DirectoryName&gt;/&lt;FileName&gt;". The tree structure has the following format: "/&lt;DirectoryName&gt;/&lt;FileName&gt;".
A relative path has the following format: "&lt;DirectoryName&gt;/&lt;FileName&gt;". The tree structure has the following format: "/&lt;CurrentServerDirectory&gt;/&lt;DirectoryName&gt;/&lt;FileName>".

**`<WLanguage procedure>: (Procedure name)`**

Name of procedure automatically called to check the transfer progress.


**`<Transfer mode>: (Optional Integer constant)`**

Transfer mode used:					


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *ftpASCIIMode* | Transfer performed in ASCII mode. This mode is used to transfer data between two different types of operating systems, from UNIX to Windows for example: the transferred file is changed into the ASCII format of destination system. |
| *ftpBinaryMode*<br>(Default value) | Transfer performed in binary mode: The file is strictly identical between the sending and the receiving. |

### Managing the progress of the transfer
<a name="managing_the_progress_the_transfer_ELTPARAGRAPHE000116"></a>

**FTPSend** is a blocking function: no other action can be performed until the end of current transfer. To check the progress of the transfer, **FTPSend** can automatically call the &lt;Procedure name&gt; procedure at regular intervals.

This procedure is declared as follows:


```txt
PROCEDURE <Procedure name>(<Total size>, <Transferred size>)
```


- &lt;Total size&gt; is an integer corresponding to the total size of file or directory currently transferred.

- &lt;Transferred size&gt; is an integer corresponding to the number of bytes already transferred.




For example, you can:

- display a progress bar,

- find out whether the transfer is completed (&lt;Total size&gt; = &lt;Transferred size>).




**FTPSend** cannot be interrupted as long as all files have not been transferred. To force the interruption of the browse, use the following line of code in the &lt;Procedure name&gt; procedure:	


```wl
RESULT False
```
In any other case (to continue the browse), &lt;Procedure name&gt; MUST return <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u>.

An error is generated if no value (neither <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> nor <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u>) is returned by the &lt;Procedure name&gt; procedure.

### Transfer timeout
<a name="transfer_timeout_ELTPARAGRAPHE000160"></a>

By default, all the FTP functions fail if the FTP server does not respond within 20 seconds. This timeout can be modified with [FTPConnect](../WDLang3/3040016.md) when connecting to the FTP server.

### Rights of users
<a name="rights_users_ELTPARAGRAPHE000188"></a>

Only a user who has write rights on the FTP server can send files to an FTP server. In most cases, no write rights are granted to the "anonymous" users.
<a name="NOTE0_5"></a>


### Relative and absolute path
<a name="relative_and_absolute_path_ELTPARAGRAPHE000195"></a>

The notions of relative path and absolute path are very important in an FTP application.

- A path starting with a slash is considered as being an **absolute path**: it is the path in relation to the root of the FTP server (parameter specific to the server).
	ex: /ad/user/JULIA

- A path not starting with a slash is considered as being a **relative path**, which means a path given in relation to the current directory. This current directory can be returned or modified by [FTPCurrentDir](../WDLang3/3040003.md).


When connecting to an FTP site, the initial directory (the "home directory" of the user) is not necessarily found at the root of the FTP server. Therefore, we recommend that you use relative paths.
