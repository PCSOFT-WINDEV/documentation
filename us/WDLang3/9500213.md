## Overview

### SaaS
<a name="saas_ELTPARAGRAPHE000009"></a>

WEBDEV allows you to easily create, host and manage SaaS sites, and to convert the existing sites to this distribution mode.

In the SaaS model, the application is accessible remotely via an Internet browser. The user does not have to install or maintain anything locally, ...

In most cases, these applications are invoiced by subscription (according to the number of users and by month for example) but several other invoicing methods can be used (according to the resources used, to the space occupied by the data, ...).

### Operating mode and use of a SaaS site from the point of view of the user
<a name="operating_mode_and_use_saas_site_from_the_point_view_the_user_ELTPARAGRAPHE000022"></a>

A SaaS site can be used by several client companies. 

Each company has its own list of users and each company accesses its own data. 

To access the SaaS site, each user must be authenticated (via a login and password). You can:

- to check that the user has an account indeed, 

- check whether the user has purchased a license allowing him to access to the entire site or part of the site, 

- check whether this license is still valid, 

- present data corresponding to the company of the user.




The diagram below presents the use of a SaaS site by two distinct companies:
<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=SaaS_Principe.gif)


The "SaaS Supplier" company proposes a site in SaaS mode. This site is used by two client companies ("Company A" and "Company B"), each one owning:

- A specific database, 

- Different graphic styles, 

- A different database of user accounts.




Therefore, each company can be invoiced according to its use of the Web site.

**Operating mode and use of a SaaS site from the point of view of the site administrator**

The diagram below presents the six main elements involved in the SaaS model:
<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=SaaS_Fonctionnement.gif)


These elements are:

| Element | Role |
| --- | --- |
| *SaaS site* | The **SaaS site** is a WEBDEV site deployed on a WEBDEV Application Server. It is associated with a SaaS Webservice used to control the site. |
| *Service* | The **Services** are the different features of a site. |
| *Client Account* | A **Client Account** represents a company that uses the **SaaS site**.<br>Each **Client Account** includes its own database and its own custom version of the **SaaS site** (logo, graphics, etc.). |
| *User* | The **Users** are the members of the company represented by the **Client Account**.<br>The users are the physical persons who are using the **SaaS site**. |
| *Pricing* | A **Pricing** represents a set of **Services** accessible by a **User**.<br>A **Pricing** can include one or more **Services**.<br>A **Service** can be proposed in one or more **Pricing**. |
| *Subscription* | A **Subscription** represents the availability of a number of licenses for a **Pricing** (and therefore of the associated **Services**) for a **User Account**.<br>Then, these licenses must be be distributed among the **Users**.<br>The **Subscriptions** are used to monitor the use of the **SaaS site** and the invoicing. |

## Prerequisites
<a name="prerequisites_ELTTEXTE000275"></a>
To deploy and manage a SaaS site, the following elements are required:

- A WEBDEV Application Server,

- The Webservice for managing the SaaS sites,

- The management site of SaaS sites.


The last two elements must be selected when installing the WEBDEV Application Server.

The Webservice for managing SaaS sites will be used via its Web alias (WDSAAS280_WEB for example) that must correspond to the directory of same name in the setup of the Application Server (by default: C:\\WEBDEV28\\WDSaaS\\WDSaaS280\\WDSAAS280_WEB).

## Developing a SaaS site
<a name="developing_saas_site_ELTTEXTE000299"></a>
The method for developing a SaaS site is the same as the method for developing any other WEBDEV site. For more details, see [Developing a SaaS site](../WDLang3/9500214.md).

<a name="NOTE5_1"></a>


## Deploying a SaaS site
<a name="deploying_saas_site_ELTTEXTE000323"></a>
When SaaS is enabled for a site, the deployment requires the following additional parameters:

- **Choosing the Webservice associated with the site**: you have the ability to use the Webservice found on the same Application Server as the one that is hosting the site (most common case) or a Webservice found on another WEBDEV Application Server (when several SaaS sites share a Webservice).

- **The name and password of the administrator of the SaaS Webservice**. This information is required to perform some deployment steps (automatic modification of HFSQL data files for example).




**Remarks**:

- In some cases, the site developer may not know the username and password of the administrator of the SaaS Webservice. In this case, you can use the setup by physical media or the setup packages and ask a person with sufficient rights to perform the setup.

- If the address of the SaaS Webservice was not specified during the deployment, the alias of the SaaS Webservice (WDSAAS280_WEB) must exist on the same virtual server as the SaaS site.

- If the address of the SaaS Webservice was specified during the deployment, the site manager must check whether the alias of the Webservice is actually available at the specified location.

## Managing a SaaS site
<a name="managing_saas_site_ELTTEXTE000347"></a>
Once it is deployed, a SaaS site must be configured before it can be used. The following operations must be performed:

- [Registering the site in the management interface](../SaaSAdminWeb/1600002.md),

- [Declaring the services proposed by the site](../SaaSAdminWeb/1600003.md),

- [Declaring the pricing](../SaaSAdminWeb/1600003.md),

- [Creating the accounts of client companies](../SaaSAdminWeb/1600004.md),

- [Creating the user accounts for each client company](../SaaSAdminWeb/1600005.md),

- [Managing the licenses granted to the client companies and to their users](../SaaSAdminWeb/1600006.md).




All these operations (as well as the access to the logs regarding the use of the site for invoicing purposes) can be done by using the SaaS Administrator. For more details, see [SaaS administrator](../SaaSAdminWeb/1600000.md).
