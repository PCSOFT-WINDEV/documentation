## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000153"></a>
The home automation via power-line carrier (X10) has now become reality. Managing electrical appliances via the existing wiring paves the way for easy remote control by programming.

Did you know that a standard electrical system can be easily changed into home automation?

With no additional wiring and no radio waves, the electrical appliances can be easily controlled by WINDEV, WINDEV Mobile or WEBDEV projects. To do so:

- use specific switches or sockets (the X10 standard is used).

- use a specific multisocket.




Turning the lights on, closing the shutters, switching a device off or finding out its status (off, on) can be easily performed from a WINDEV, WINDEV Mobile or WEBDEV project.

**Remark**: In this version, the CM11 interfaces (from Marmitek) and the CM15 interfaces are supported.

### Controlling electrical appliances
<a name="controlling_electrical_appliances_ELTPARAGRAPHE000031"></a>

To control electrical appliances:

1. Establish a connection with an X10 interface ([DomoOpen](../WDLang3/1000003102.md)).

2. Switch the electrical devices on ([DomoSwitchOn](../WDLang3/1000003101.md) or [DomoSend](../WDLang3/1000003104.md)).

3. Send the command to perform: switch on, increase or reduce the intensity, stop ([DomoSend](../WDLang3/1000003104.md)).

4. Check the status of electrical devices: off or on ([DomoStatus](../WDLang3/1000003105.md)).

5. Switch off the electrical devices ([DomoSwitchOff](../WDLang3/1000003103.md)).

6. Close the connection with the X10 interface ([DomoClose](../WDLang3/1000003106.md)).




**Remark**: In order for the X10 protocol to operate properly through power-line carrier, continuous power is required between the devices. For example, the transmission cannot pass through an insulation transformer.

### Controlling a CM15 module
<a name="controlling_cm15_module_ELTPARAGRAPHE000068"></a>

**Prerequisite**: 

1. Install the "Active Home" software supplied with the CM 15 module.

2. Install the "ahscript_setup.exe" program. This program is available on the "Active Home" CD supplied with the CM15 module.


**Remark**: the USB cable must be connected before the power cable.

**Implementation**

1. Establish a connection with an X10 interface ([DomoOpen](../WDLang3/1000003102.md)).

2. Switch the electrical devices on ([DomoSwitchOn](../WDLang3/1000003101.md) or [DomoSend](../WDLang3/1000003104.md)).

3. Send the command to perform: switch on, increase or reduce the intensity, stop ([DomoSend](../WDLang3/1000003104.md)).

4. Switch off the electrical devices ([DomoSwitchOff](../WDLang3/1000003103.md)).

5. Close the connection with the X10 interface ([DomoClose](../WDLang3/1000003106.md)).


**Limitation**: [DomoStatus](../WDLang3/1000003105.md) is not available.
