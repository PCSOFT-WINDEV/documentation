<a name="Use"></a>
<a name="description"></a>
Creates a secure socket according to the SSL protocol.  
<a name="Example1"></a>
<a name="sample_code"></a>

## Example


```wl
// Create a server of SSL Sockets with a certificate
sSSLSocket is string = "sSSLSocket"
// Use the hash of the certificate, 
// "Numeric print" property in the manager of certificates
// (certmgr.msc)
IF NOT SocketCreateSSL(sSSLSocket, 5043, "9d a4 84 fc f6 62 92 90 9a 62 d4 " + ...
		"ca 65 fb 08 7e 06 45 of 24", CertificateHash) THEN
	Error(ErrorInfo())
	RETURN
ELSE	
	Info("SSL server socket started")

	// Rest of the server socket ...

	// The socket must be closed at the end of process
	SocketClose(sSSLSocket)
END
```

## Syntax

`<Result> = SocketCreateSSL(<Socket name> , <Port number> , <Certificate Identifier> [, <SSL options> [, <Address>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the socket was created,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. If an error occurs, you can get more details on the error with [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md).




**`<Socket name>: (Character string)`**

Name that will be given to the socket. This name will be used by all socket functions. Caution: the socket name is case sensitive.

**`<Port number>: (Integer)`**

Port number that will be given to the socket. This number must be included between 5000 and 65000. This number will be specified when the client computers are connected to the server. This connection will be established by [SocketConnectSSL](../WDLang3/1000017042.md).

**`<Certificate Identifier>: (Character string)`**

Name or hash of certificate to use (according to the specified &lt;SSL options&gt;): 

- name of certificat if the *CertificateName* constant is used, 

- hash of certificate if the *CertificateHash* constant is used. The space characters are allowed in the Hash. The hash of the certificate can be found in the "Digital Print" property in the certificate manager (certmgr.msc) of the computer, for example:
	"9d a4 84 fc f6 62 92 90 9a 62 d4 ca 65 fb 08 7e 06 45 de 24"




This certificate must have a private key, installed on the server. For more details, see [How to create an SSL certificate?](../WDLang3/3070021.md)

**`<SSL options>: (Optional combination of integer constants)`**

Protocol and identification mode used: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *ProtocolSSL2* | Use of SSL2. protocol |
| *ProtocolSSL3* | Use of SSL3. protocol |
| *ProtocolTLS1* | TLS1 protocol |
| *ProtocolTLS1_1* | TLS 1.1 protocol |
| *ProtocolTLS1_2* | TLS 1.2 protocol |
| *ProtocolTLS1_3* | TLS 1.3 protocol |






|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *CertificateHash* | &lt;Certificate identifier&gt; corresponds to the hash of certificate. |
| *CertificateName* | &lt;Certificate identifier&gt; corresponds to the name of certificate. |


By default, the combination used is: *ProtocolTLS1* + *ProtocolTLS1_1* + *ProtocolTLS1_2* + *CertificateName*.

**`<Address>: (Optional character string)`**

IP address on which the socket must be created on the current computer. If the current computer is associated with several IP addresses (or with several network cards), this parameter enables you to choose the IP address that will be associated with the socket.

This IP address can have the following format:

- IP address in XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX format (125.5.110.100 for example).

- IP address containing the name of the server (www.windev.com for example). This syntax is recommended.




![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) The IP address is also returned by [NetIPAddress](../WDLang3/3056023.md).

## Remarks


### Re-creating a socket
<a name="recreating_socket_ELTPARAGRAPHE000118"></a>

If a socket is not closed properly by [SocketClose](../WDLang3/3070015.md) (restarting the computer for example), re-creating the socket may take quite a long time. Indeed, you will have to wait until the socket is freed by the system.
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Re-using an address that is already used
<a name="reusing_address_that_already_used_ELTPARAGRAPHE000128"></a>

By default, **SocketCreateSSL** allows you to reuse an address already used (by the application itself or by another application). To forbid this operating mode, type the following line of code:


```wl
Socket.Option = SocketNoReuseAddress
```


**Remark**: This option also allows you to find out whether an address or a port is already used. In this case, **SocketCreateSSL** returns an error.
