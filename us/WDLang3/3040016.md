Connects the current computer to an FTP server (File Transfer Protocol).

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png) The available secure connection modes are as follows: 

- FTPS: FTP secured according to the SSL protocol with implicit encryption. 

- FTPES: FTP secured according to the SSL protocol with explicit encryption. 

- SFTP: FTP secured by a SSH channel.

## Syntax

`<Result> = FTPConnect(<Server> [, <User name> [, <Password> [, <Port number> [, <Type of connection> [, <Connection timeout> [, <Private key> [, <Key password>]]]]]]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**



- Connection identifier,

- 0 during the first connection.

- -1 if an error occurred. The details of the error are returned by [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) with the *errCode* or *errMessage* constant. 
	If an identification error occurs, [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md) with the *errCode* constant returns the *ftpErrorAuthentification* constant.






**`<Server>: (Character string)`**

Name of FTP server ("ftp.cdrom.com" for example) or IP address of FTP server ("192.54.12.8" for example).

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png) This parameter is used to define the protocol used: 

- if the server name starts with "ftp://", the connection is established in non-secure mode. 

- if the server name starts with "ftps://", the connection is established in secure mode according to the FTPS protocol (FTP secured by SSL with implicit encryption). 

- if the server name starts with "ftpes://", the connection is established in secure mode according to the FTPES protocol (FTP secured by SSL with explicit encryption). 

- if the server name starts with "sftp://", the connection is established in secure mode via a SSH channel according to the SFTP protocol. 




**`<User name>: (Optional character string)`**



- Name of user attempting to perform a named connection (user authentication on FTP server). This parameter is given by the administrator of FTP server.

- Empty string ("") to perform an anonymous connection.




**`<Password>: (Optional character string)`**

User password: used to identify the user on the FTP server. This parameter is given by the administrator of FTP server.

This password corresponds to:

- the specified &lt;Password&gt; if this parameter is not an empty string (""), 

- the email address of the user if &lt;Username&gt; is not specified or it is equal to an empty string (""), 

- an empty string ("") if this parameter is not specified and if &lt;Username&gt; does not correspond to an empty string ("").


Remark: If the password contains special characters, it may be necessary to convert it to UTF-8 using [StringToUTF8](../WDLang1/3024042.md).

**`<Port number>: (Optional integer)`**

Number of the port on which the server will be run. This parameter is given by the administrator of FTP server.

By default: 

- for a non-secure connection, this port is port 21.

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png) for a secure connection in FTPS mode, this port is port 990. 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png) for a secure connection in FTPES mode, this port is port 21.

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png) for a secure connection in SFTP mode, this port is port 22.




**`<Type of connection>: (Optional Integer constant)`**

Type of connection to establish: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *ftpActiveMode* (or <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> for compatibility) | **Active connection** to the FTP server. <br><br>When transferring files, the client starts the transfer. This type of connection may be refused by some protected FTP servers. |
| *ftpExtendedPassiveMode* | **Extended passive connection** to the FTP server (EPSV mode). <br><br>When transferring files, the server takes the initiative for the transfer. This type of connection is used to step over some "firewalls". <br><br>If the server does not support the extended passive mode (the FEAT command is sent to the server to find out the capacity), the connection is crippled in simple passive mode. <br><br>Limitations: <br><br>- This mode is not supported when using the "wininet" module of Windows (see [FTPParameter](../WDLang3/1000020947.md)): the connection is performed in *ftpPassiveMode*. <br><br>- ![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Constant not available.<br><br><br> |
| *ftpPassiveMode* (or <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> for compatibility)<br>(Default value) | **Passive connection** to the FTP server (PASV mode). <br><br>When transferring files, the server takes the initiative for the transfer. This type of connection is used to step over some "firewalls".<br><br>Remark: If the connection to the server is in IPV6, the connection will be performed in extended passive mode (because the passive mode does not support IPV6). |
| *ftpPassiveModeIgnoreIP* | **Passive connection** to the FTP server (PASV mode). <br><br>When transferring files in passive mode, the server sets the port and IP address for data transfer. With this parameter, only the port is taken into account. The IP address is ignored.<br>This type of connection allows the use of FTP servers that return non-routable IP addresses but are reachable via the connection IP address<br><br>Limitations: <br><br>- This mode is not supported when using the "wininet" module of Windows (see [FTPParameter](../WDLang3/1000020947.md)): the connection is performed in *ftpPassiveMode*. <br><br><br> |



**`<Connection timeout>: (Optional integer or optional Duration)`**

Number of seconds after which the request for connecting to the FTP server is canceled (20 by default). This timeout applies to all FTP operations performed on this connection. If no response is received from the server during the specified &lt;Connection timeout&gt;, **FTPConnect** returns -1.
Remark: This parameter can correspond to: 

- an integer corresponding to the number of seconds,

- a Duration variable,

- the duration in a readable format (e.g., '1s'). 




**`<Private key>: (Optional character string)`**

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png) Name and path of file corresponding to the private key used during a connection in SFTP mode. This file must have been generated in OpenSSH format. 
If this parameter is not specified, the secure connection is using an authentication by &lt;Username&gt;/&lt;Password&gt;. 

**`<Key password>: (Optional ANSI character string)`**

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png) Password of file containing the private key used during a connection in SFTP mode.
If UNICODE strings are used at runtime ("Unicode" tab of the [current configuration](../Editeurs/9000030.md)), the password must not be specified between quotation marks. It must be in a string variable declared in ANSI format.
If this parameter is not specified, the secure connection is using an authentication by &lt;Username&gt;/&lt;Password&gt;.

### Security error in a secure FTPS connection
<a name="security_error_secure_ftps_connection_ELTPARAGRAPHE000246"></a>

During a secure transaction, the function may fail due to security errors:

- invalid certificate or certificate coming from an unknown company.

- site name found in the certificate not corresponding to a server.

- invalid or expired certificate date.




You have the ability to connect while ignoring these errors. To do so, use the **FTP.IgnoreError** variable:

| Value of FTP.IgnoreError<br>(these values can be combined) | Description |
| --- | --- |
| *ftpIgnoreInvalidCertificate* | The certificate is ignored. |
| *ftpIgnoreExpiredCertificate* | The certificate date is ignored. |
| *ftpIgnoreInvalidCertificateName* | The site name specified in the certificate is ignored. |
| *ftpIgnoreRevocation* | The certificate revocation is ignored. |


```wl
// Example for error management

xnum is int
FTP.IgnoreError = ftpIgnoreExpiredCertificate + ftpIgnoreInvalidCertificate + ...
	ftpIgnoreInvalidCertificateName + ftpIgnoreRevocation
xnum = FTPConnect("ftpes://My_Server_IP", "My_User", "My_Password", 21, True)
IF xnum =-1  THEN
       Info(ErrorInfo(errMessage))
ELSE
       Info("OK")
END
```
