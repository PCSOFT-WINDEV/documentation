Seeks one or more emails according to specified criteria, in a local or remote Lotus Notes or Domino database.

This search can be performed:

- in one or more sections of the email.

- via a selection formula of Lotus Notes.

## Example


```wl
// Start a Lotus Notes session
SessionID is int
SessionID = EmailStartNotesSession("Password", "MarsServer", ...
		"email/julia.nsf", "C:\Lotus Notes\julia.id")
...
// Find the emails containing "PC Soft" 
// in the message subject or body
// Only the incoming emails are taken into account
IF EmailSeekFirst(SessionID, emailSubject + emailBody, ...
			"PC Soft", notesReceived) = True THEN
	// Enumerate the emails found
	WHILE Email.Out = False
		// Displays the sender and subject in a Table control
		TableAdd(TABLE_EmailFound, Email.Sender + ...
				TAB + Email.Subject)
		// Next email found
		EmailReadNext(SessionID)
	END
ELSE
	Info("No email was found")
END
```
