## Syntax

### Adding a file while specifying the path section to keep

`<Result> = <Archive>.AddFile(<File path> [, <Path section to keep> [, <Progress>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**



- 0 if the addition was performed,

- an error code (value greater than 0) otherwise. For more details on these error codes, see the remarks.




**`<Archive>: (zipArchive variable)`**

Name of a variable of type [zipArchive](../WDLang3/1000018679.md) corresponding to the archive in which the file must be added.

**`<File path>: (Character string)`**

Path of the file to be added to the archive (260 characters maximum, 90 maximum for TAR or TGZ (TAR.GZ) archives). This path can be a full path or a path relative to the current directory. Wildcard characters (\*,?) are not allowed in the file name.
This file must not exceed 4 GB. Otherwise, an error occurs.

![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) The access path to the file is a full path or a path relative to the working directory of the application (returned by [fDataDir](../WDLang1/3036001.md)). Only the files found in the working directory can be added to the archive. 

**`<Path section to keep>: (Optional constant)`**

Indicates the section of the file path that will be kept in the archive:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *zipDirectory*<br>(Default value) | Keeps the different directories of the file path as well as the file name and extension. For example: \\Directory\\Files\\FileName.pdf |
| *zipDrive* | Keeps the full and absolute file path (name of disk, name of directories, file name and file extension). For example: C:\\Directory\\Files\\FileName.pdf<br>**For the ZIP format**: This constant has no effect.<br>**For the 7z format**: This constant and *zipDirectory* will have the same effect<br><br>![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) This constant is not available as there is no root for the drive.![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This constant and *zipDirectory* will have the same effect. |
| *zipNone* | Keeps the file name and extension. For example: FileName.pdf |


**If you are using an archive in .CAB format**, only the *zipNone* constant is taken into account. Indeed, the .CAB format cannot be used to save the paths inside the archive.
![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) This parameter is not available: only the file name and extension are kept.

**`<Progress>: (Control name or procedure name)`**

Progress bar management mode. This parameter can correspond to: 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) the name of a Progress Bar control found in a window. The progress bar will display the addition and compression progress of the file being managed.  

- the name of a WLanguage procedure. For more details on this procedure, see [Parameters of the procedure used by &lt;zipArchive variable&gt;.AddFile](../WDLang3/1000025730.md). 




**If you are using an archive in TAR or TGZ (TAR.GZ) format**, the progress bar is updated at the end of file addition only. 



![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This parameter is not available.

## Remarks


### Use condition
<a name="use_condition_ELTPARAGRAPHE000655"></a>

Adding files into an archive can be performed if:

- The archive exists (archives are created using [&lt;zipArchive variable&gt;.Create](../WDLang3/1000019160.md)).

- The archive is accessible in read/write.

- The archive is a single-part archive.

- The size of the file is less than 4 GB.




**Caution**: 

- **Archives in CAB format**: The files must be added immediately after the archive creation. This format cannot be used to add files into an existing archive.  

- **Archives in 7z format**: The archive is entirely compressed whenever **&lt;zipArchive variable&gt;.AddFile** is called. This function is recommended when adding a single file. If several files must be added into the archive, use [&lt;zipArchive variable&gt;.AddFileList](../WDLang3/1000019159.md) or [&lt;zipArchive variable&gt;.AddDirectory](../WDLang3/1000019078.md). 




The maximum number of files that can be included:

- in a WDZ file: 232-1.

- in a ZIP file: 65535. 

- in a CAB file: 65535. 


Reminder: 

- ![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png)![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) Only the archives in ZIP, TAR or TGZ (TAR.GZ) format are available.



<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Compression level of ZIP or 7z archives
<a name="compression_level_zip_7z_archives_ELTPARAGRAPHE000740"></a>

The files added into an archive in ZIP or 7z format are compressed by default. The compression level of files added into an archive can be modified by [zipCompressionLevel](../WDLang3/3082054.md).
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Error codes
<a name="error_codes_ELTPARAGRAPHE000753"></a>

The following error codes are returned:

- 1: The path passed as parameter does not exist.

- 2: Access denied: the user has no sufficient rights or the file is currently used. If the file to insert is an HFSQL data file, it must be closed by the following code:
	
	```wl
	HFerme(NomFichier)
	Multitâche() // Attend la fermeture effective du fichier
	```


- 3: The archive is corrupted.

- 4: The path does not exist in the archive.

- 5: Unable to write into the archive.

- 7: The file is already found in the archive.

- 8: An archive cannot be added to itself. For example, "MyArchive" cannot be added to "MyArchive".




The message corresponding to the error code is returned by [zipMsgError](../WDLang3/3082034.md).
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Adding a file that is already found in the archive
<a name="adding_file_that_already_found_the_archive_ELTPARAGRAPHE000778"></a>

An error occurs when adding a file that is already found in the archive. A file is identified according to the path saved in the archive. Therefore, two files with the same name and with the same relative path cannot be added into an archive.

For example, the *zipNone* constant cannot be used to add two files with the same name found in different directories.
<a name="NOTE0_5"></a>


### Index of files in the archive
<a name="index_files_the_archive_ELTPARAGRAPHE000790"></a>

When a file is added into an archive, an index is automatically assigned to the file. This index corresponds to the order in which the files are included in the archive. To select a file in the archive, you can use:

- the element subscript (remark: the index of an element is returned by [SearchFile](../WDLang3/1000026330.md)).

- or the path of the element saved in the archive.


<a name="NOTE0_6"></a>


### Path kept (archives in WDZ or ZIP format)
<a name="path_kept_archives_wdz_zip_format_ELTPARAGRAPHE000809"></a>

The array below shows the paths kept in the archive according to:

- the access path to the file,

- the path section to keep.


![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) The current directory is: "C:\\Temp":


|   |   |   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **zipAddFile** | **File location** | *zipNone* | *zipDirectory* | *zipDrive* |
| zipAddFile<br>("Archi", "File.txt") | C:\\Temp\\File.txt | File.txt | File.txt | File.txt |
| zipAddFile<br>("Archi", "Data\\File.txt") | C:\\Temp\\Data\\File.txt | File.txt | Data\\File.txt | Data\\File.txt |
| zipAddFile<br>("Archi", "D:\\Data\\File.txt") | D:\\Data\\File.txt | File.txt | Data\\File.txt | D:\\Data\\File.txt |


**Remark**: If the constant *zipDrive* is used, the WDZ format keeps the full path of the file (including the drive letter) while the ZIP format does not keep the drive letter.


![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) The disk is not kept in the archive path.

![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) The directory and disk are not kept in the archive path. Only the file name and extension are kept.
