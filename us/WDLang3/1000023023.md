The **mqttSession** type is used to define the parameters for connecting to the MQTT broker. These connection parameters can be defined and changed by several WLanguage properties. 

**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

## Example


```wl
// Declare the MQTT connection
gMqttSession is mqttSession

// Retrieve the data typed in the connection window
gMqttSession.Address = EDT_Broker_Address
gMqttSession.Port = EDT_Port
gMqttSession.Option = CBOX_SSL
gMqttSession.ConnectionTimeout = EDT_Connection_Timeout
gMqttSession.User = EDT_Login
gMqttSession.UserPassword = EDT_PSW
gMqttSession.PrivateKey = EDT_Private_Key
gMqttSession.PrivateKeyPassword = EDT_Private_Key_PSW
gMqttSession.ClientID = EDT_ClientID
gMqttSession.CleanSession = CBOX_Clean_Session
IF MQTTConnect(gMqttSession) THEN
	Message("Connection OK")
ELSE	
	Error("Connection problem. '" + ErrorInfo() + "')")
END

### Properties specific to mqttSession variables
<a name="properties_specific_mqttsession_variables_ELTPARAGRAPHE000047"></a>

The following properties can be used to handle a MQTT session:

| Property name | Type used | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Address | Character string | Address of MQTT server (also called "MQTT broker"). This address can be given in the following format:<br><br>- IP address in XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX format (125.5.110.100 for example).<br><br>- IP address containing the server name (MQTTServer for example). This syntax is recommended.<br><br><br> |
| CleanSession | Boolean | <br><br>- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> to clean the generic global parameters on the server,<br><br>- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. <br><br><br> |
| ClientID | Character string | Client identifier. This property must not be left empty. |
| ConnectionTimeout | Integer ou Duration | Connection timeout in seconds. This property can correspond to: <br><br>- an integer corresponding to the number of seconds,<br><br>- a Duration variable,<br><br>- the duration in a readable format (e.g., 10 s). <br><br><br> |
| Option | Integer constant | Connection options. This property can correspond to the *optionSSL* constant for an SSL connection. |
| Port | Integer | Port of MQTT server. This port correspondsn to 1883 by default (or 8883 for an SSL connection). |
| PrivateKey | Character string or [Certificate](../WDLang1/1000019287.md) variable | Name of the [Certificate](../WDLang1/1000019287.md) variable or path of the pem file (to make a private key connection). <br><br>If this property is specified, an authentication by key is performed: only the **User**, **PrivateKey** and **PrivateKeyPassword** properties are taken into account. |
| PrivateKeyPassword | Character string | Password of key file (for a connection by private key). The **PrivateKey** property corresponds to the private key to be used. |
| User | Character string | Username. |
| UserPassword | Character string | User's password used in password authentication (the **User** property is the user's name). |

### Authentication mode
<a name="authentication_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000147"></a>

The authentication by key has priority over the authentication by password. 

Key authentication is used if: 

- the server supports this authentication mode. 

- the **PrivateKey** property is specified. 




Password authentication is used if: 

- the server supports this authentication mode. 

- the **UserPassword** is specified.

The following functions are used to handle the **mqttSession** variables: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [MQTTConnect](../WDLang3/1000023021.md) | Used to connect to a MQTT server (also called "Broker"). |
| [MQTTDisconnect](../WDLang3/1000023022.md) | Allows you to disconnect from a MQTT server (also called "Broker"). |
| [MQTTPublish](../WDLang3/1000023060.md) | Publishes a message on the MQTT broker. |
| [MQTTSubscribe](../WDLang3/1000023073.md) | Used to subscribe to a MQTT notification. |
| [MQTTUnsubscribe](../WDLang3/1000023074.md) | Used to unsubscribe from a MQTT notification. |
| [MQTTUnsubscribeAll](../WDLang3/1000023080.md) | Allows you to unsubscribe from all the existing subscriptions. |
