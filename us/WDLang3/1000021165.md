**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

### Multiple HTTP responses
<a name="multiple_http_responses_ELTPARAGRAPHE000114"></a>

If the response contains multiple HTTP results (for example, if a proxy adds an HTTP code), the **StatusCode** and **DescriptionStatusCode** properties return the values of the first HTTP response. In this case, the **RoughHeader** property contains all responses.
