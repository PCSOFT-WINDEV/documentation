The **Address** type is used to manipulate the address of a place or person. An address is defined by a postal address (street, city, state, zip code, country) and/or a geographic position (latitude and longitude). The characteristics of this address can be defined and changed via different WLanguage properties. 

**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).
