The **Calendar** type is used to handle a calendar (or organizer) associated with a user account or found on the device. You have the ability to list the appointments of the calendar via [AppointmentListCalendar](../WDLang3/1000020661.md).

The characteristics of this calendar can be read by several WLanguage properties.

**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

| --- | --- | --- |
| AccountName | Character string | Name of the user account with which the calendar is associated. <br><br><br><br>If this property corresponds to an empty string (""), the calendar is associated with no account: it is stored locally on the device. |
