## Example


```wl
// In a museum, we want to trigger the reading (resp. the stop) of an audio guide 
// when the visitor enters into (resp. exits from) a room. 
// Each Beacon is associated with the same UUID corresponding to the museum and 
// a Major number corresponding to the room in which the beacon will be positioned. 
// A Beacon is placed at each entrance to each room of the museum.. 
// The application must call the BeaconDetectBackground function 
// with an array of BeaconGroup variables corresponding to each museum room. 

// The callback procedure passed as parameter to the function will be called
// whenever entering into or exiting from a room and it will give information 
// about the detected groupe of beacons in order to
// emulate the audio-guide to play the corresponding track.

// Museum UUID
sUUID is string = "f4231ab6-5ef2-6c99-4229-af6c72e0446e"
// Create a beaconGroup variable for each room
groupRoom1 is beaconGroup
groupRoom1.UUID = sUUID
groupRoom1.Major = 1
groupRoom2 is beaconGroup
groupRoom2.UUID = sUUID
groupRoom2.Major = 2
groupRoom3 is beaconGroup
groupRoom3.UUID = sUUID
groupRoom3.Major = 3
groupRoom4 is beaconGroup
groupRoom4.UUID = sUUID
groupRoom4.Major = 4
// Start the detection
arrBeaconGroup is array of beaconGroup = [groupRoom1, ...
    groupRoom2, groupRoom3, groupRoom4)
// The ProcDetection procedure will be run whenever the mobile enters into 
// or exits from the area defined by each group of beacons. 
BeaconDetectBackground(arrBeaconGroup, ProcDetection)
```

```wl
PROCEDURE ProcDetection(Group is beaconGroup, nType is int)

IF nType = bdbLeave THEN 
	// Stop the current track
	RETURN
END
	
IF nType = bdbEnter THEN	
	SWITCH Group.Major
		CASE 1
		// Read the track for room 1
		CASE 2
		// Read the track for room 2
		...
	END
END

### Starting a detection on several groups of Beacons in the background

`<Result> = BeaconDetectBackground(<Array> , <WLanguage procedure>)`
---

**`<Result>: (Boolean)`**



- <u><u><u><u>True</u></u></u></u> if the detection was started,

- <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> otherwise. To get more details on the error, use [ErrorInfo](../WDLang1/3013008.md).




**`<Array>: (Array of beaconGroup)`**

Name of the array of [beaconGroup](../WDLang3/1000023105.md) variables that describe the group of Beacons to detect.

**`<WLanguage procedure>: (Procedure name)`**

Name of the WLanguage procedure ("callback") called when the device enters or leaves the transmission range of a group of Beacons. 

This procedure has the following format: 


```txt
PROCEDURE <Procedure name>(<Group>, <Type>)
```


- The &lt;Group&gt; parameter is a [beaconGroup](../WDLang3/1000023105.md) variable that describes the group of beacons for which the device has just entered or left the transmission range. 

- The &lt;Type&gt; parameter is an integer constant corresponding to one of the following values: 
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *bdbEnter* | The device entered the transmission range of a group of Beacons. |
| *bdbLeave* | The device left the transmission range of a group of Beacons. |






Caution: 

- This procedure must be a global procedure of project. Otherwise, a fatal error will occur during the call to the function.

- This procedure must not access the application interface. Indeed, as the procedure can be called in background, the windows are not necessarily opened.

**`<Group of Beacons>: (beaconGroup variable)`**

Name of the WLanguage procedure ("callback") called when the device enters or leaves the transmission range of a group of Beacons. 

This procedure has the following format:

- The &lt;Group&gt; parameter is a [beaconGroup](../WDLang3/1000023105.md) variable that describes the group of beacons for which the device has just entered or left the transmission range. 

- The &lt;Type&gt; parameter is an integer constant corresponding to one of the following values:

## Remarks


### Using a service for mobile detection
<a name="using_service_for_mobile_detection_ELTPARAGRAPHE000101"></a>

**BeaconDetectBackground** enables a service for mobile detection that is not linked to WINDEV Mobile. When this service is enabled, it is paused and it **only detects the entries and exits into/from ranges**. 

**Caution**: To reduce battery consumption, the device searches for nearby Beacons in time intervals up to several minutes. Therefore, there may be some time between the moment the device enters (or or leaves) the transmission range of a group of Beacons, and the the moment the notification appears in the application.

To stop the service for mobile detection, you must: 

- use the [BeaconStopBackgroundDetection](../WDLang3/1000023114.md) function. 

- uninstall the application. 


Caution: Closing and re-running the application has no effect on the operating mode of service for mobile detection. 


### How to identify nearby Beacons?
<a name="how_identify_nearby_beacons_ELTPARAGRAPHE000120"></a>

The Beacon detection via **BeaconDetectBackground** is independent of the application lifespan (this detection is performed by a service of mobile device that is not linked to WINDEV Mobile). 

- **If the application is in background**, it will continue to receive the entry and exit notifications. 

- **If the application is stopped then restarted in the same range**, there will be no notification. It is necessary to leave the transmission range to receive an exit notification. Likewise, it is necessary to enter the range to receive an entry notification. 

- **If the application is stopped**, it will be automatically started when a group of Beacons is detected. In this case, the following processes are run: 

	- project initialization code,

	- WLanguage procedure ("callback" procedure) passed as parameter to **BeaconDetectBackground**. 


The first application window will not be opened.




There are several solutions to get the exact list of Beacons near the device, and to determine how far they are: 

- Call [BeaconDetectPrecise](../WDLang3/1000023115.md). This function consumes a lot of energy and to save the device battery, we advise you to call it: 

	- in the WLanguage procedure (callback procedure) of **BeaconDetectBackground**.

	- when starting the application. 

	- in the process for moving the application in the foreground. 




- Save the transmission range where the device is via the WLanguage procedure of **BeaconDetectBackground**. This storage can be performed in a file.  





### Miscellaneous
<a name="miscellaneous_ELTPARAGRAPHE000153"></a>

- The active detections can be listed by [BeaconListBackgroundDetection](../WDLang3/1000023113.md). 

- If a group of Beacons with the same information (UUID, major, minor) is added several times into the list of active detections, only the last addition will be taken into account.
