## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000173"></a>
WINDEV and WINDEV allow you to easily access the data handled by Lotus Notes (Domino database). You have the ability to retrieve, modify, add or handle your contacts, appointments, tasks, emails, databases, ...

The data managed by Lotus Notes is organized as follows:

- A database per user containing the emails, the tasks and the appointments of this user.

- A database common to all users containing the contacts and the groups of contacts.

- Several databases containing documents.




To access Lotus Notes, the Lotus Notes client must be installed on the end-user computers.

### Method for accessing Lotus Notes:
<a name="method_for_accessing_lotus_notes_ELTPARAGRAPHE000026"></a>

1. Establishing the connection with the Domino server: [NotesOpenConnection](../WDLang3/1000005102.md).

2. Starting a session for accessing the emails, tasks, appointments, contacts and/or groups of contacts: [EmailStartNotesSession](../WDLang3/3032121.md) (by specifying the identifier of the connection and the local or remote Lotus Notes database to use, syntax 2) or [EmailStartSession](../WDLang3/3032028.md) associated with an [emailNotesSession](../WDLang3/1000018768.md) variable.

3. Starting a session for accessing documents: [NotesOpenDatabase](../WDLang3/1000005101.md) (by specifying the connection identifier and the local or remote Lotus Notes database to use).

4. Changing the Lotus Notes database to use: [NotesCloseDatabase](../WDLang3/1000005111.md) and [NotesOpenDatabase](../WDLang3/1000005101.md).

5. Closing the connection to the Domino server: [CloseSession](../WDLang3/3032124.md) or [EmailCloseSession](../WDLang3/3032006.md).




**Quick method if you do not want to access the documents**
If you only want to access the emails, tasks, appointments, contacts and/or groups of contacts, you have the ability to establish the connection with the Domino server and to start a session for accessing the Lotus Notes database by using [EmailStartNotesSession](../WDLang3/3032121.md) directly (syntax 1), without calling [NotesOpenConnection](../WDLang3/1000005102.md).

## Handling data
<a name="handling_data_ELTTEXTE000227"></a>
Once the connection was established with the Domino server and once the Lotus Notes database was specified, you have the ability to handle:

- the emails via the [Email functions](../WDLang3/3032034.md).

- the tasks via the [Task functions](../WDLang3/1000012009.md).

- the appointments via the [Appointment functions](../WDLang3/1000011009.md).

- the contacts via the [Contact functions](../WDLang3/1000006110.md).

- the groups of contacts via the [Group functions](../WDLang3/1000008119.md).

- the documents via the [Notes functions](../WDLang3/1000005117.md).

### Sending emails
<a name="sending_emails_ELTPARAGRAPHE000113"></a>

When sending an email, if one or more CR characters are found at the end of the outgoing message, these characters are automatically deleted by Lotus Notes. This deletion is performed when the message is converted into a Rich Text string.

Caution: To send emails, Lotus Notes must be installed in connected mode (and not in local mode).

The order in which the emails are read may differ from the order in which the emails are displayed in Lotus Notes.
