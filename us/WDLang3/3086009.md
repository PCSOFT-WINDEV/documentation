## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000111"></a>
WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile allow you to directly import Webservices into your applications.

A Webservice is a set of entry points made available to the users in order to perform different processes. For example, a service for remote access provides the processes used to access the data. The exchanges of information with a Webservice are performed in XML format and they use the SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) and HTTP protocols.

From the description in WSDL format (Web Services Description Language) of this service, WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile will automatically generate the WLanguage types and functions corresponding to the programming interface of the Webservice.

**Remark**: For backward compatibility with the earlier versions, you can also ask to generate a set of procedures or a class whose methods correspond to the Webservice operations. However, we recommend you that use the new mechanism for automatically generation of native types.

To use the Webservice, all you have to do is use the functions generated during the import.

## Importing a Webservice into a project (compatibility with version 14)
<a name="importing_webservice_into_project_compatibility_with_version_14_ELTTEXTE000135"></a>
For backward compatibility, you still have the ability to import Webservices by using the mechanisms of WINDEV 14. If this import mode is used, the new features of the Webservices will not be available.

To import a Webservice:

1. On the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, expand "Import" and select "A Webservice (Soap, .Net, J2EE)". The Webservice import wizard starts.

2. Select the WSDL description of the service to import. This description can be loaded:

	- from an Internet address, 

	- from an XML file found on the current computer.




3. Check "Import in mode compatible with version 14". 

4. Select the specific features of the Webservice. These specific features are used to define the WLanguage functions that will be used in the generated procedures:

	- [SOAP functions](../WDLang3/3069006.md)

	- [.Net functions](../WDLang3/3031013.md)

	- [J2EE functions](../WDLang3/3047002.md)
			**Remark**: If you do not know the specific features of the Webservice, select the [SOAP functions](../WDLang3/3069006.md).




5. Specify whether the service must be imported into a class or a set of procedures. You have the ability to specify whether the service elements (class, structure, member) must be automatically prefixed or not.

6. Depending on the options, select:

	- the name and the file of the set of procedures to generate (".WDG" file).

	- the name and the file of the class to generate (".WDC" file).




7. Validate. The corresponding set of procedures or class is automatically generated and associated with the current project.
