## Sharing different WINDEV elements
<a name="sharing_different_windev_elements_ELTTEXTE000067"></a>
The same WINDEV elements (analysis, reports, queries, etc.) can be used in a WINDEV application and a WINDEV Mobile application:

- **Windows**: Windows have a different format in WINDEV (".WDW" file) and WINDEV Mobile (".WPW" file). Indeed, the windows do not have the same size, the same characteristics, the same features, the same user approach, ... WINDEV Mobile allows you to import WINDEV windows into a WINDEV Mobile project.

- **Help**: This type of element does not exist in Android or iOS.

- **Analysis, reports, queries, classes, set of procedures, ...**: These elements can be shared between a WINDEV application and a WINDEV Mobile application.

**Remark**: Several functions are used to differentiate the code to run from a WINDEV Mobile application or from a WINDEV application: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [InAndroidEmulatorMode](../WDLang1/1000019146.md) | Indicates whether the code is run in the Android emulator. |
| [InAndroidMode](../WDLang1/1000018990.md) | Indicates whether the code is run in Android mode. |
| [InAndroidSimulatorMode](../WDLang1/1000019181.md) | Indicates whether the code is run in the Android simulator. |
| [InAppleWatchEmulatorMode](../WDLang1/1000022067.md) | Indicates whether the code is run in the Apple Watch emulator. |
| [InAppleWatchMode](../WDLang1/1000022065.md) | Indicates whether the code currently run is in Apple Watch mode. |
| [InAppleWatchSimulatorMode](../WDLang1/1000022066.md) | Indicates whether the code is run in the Apple Watch simulator. |
| [InDeviceOwnerMode](../WDLang1/1000024428.md) | Indicates whether the Android application is in "Device owner" mode. |
| [IniOSEmulatorMode](../WDLang1/1000019766.md) | Indicates whether the code is run in the iOS emulator (iPhone, iPad). |
| [IniOSMode](../WDLang1/1000019765.md) | Indicates whether the code currently run is in iOS mode (iPhone, iPad). |
| [IniOSSimulatorMode](../WDLang1/1000019767.md) | Indicates whether the code is run in the iOS simulator (iPhone, iPad). |
| [InKioskMode](../WDLang1/1000024427.md) | Indicates whether the Android application is in kiosk mode. |
| [InMacCatalystMode](../WDLang1/1000024934.md) | Indicates whether the application is running in Mac Catalyst mode (running an iPad application on a Mac). |
| [InPocketSimulatorMode](../WDLang1/1000019182.md) | Indicates whether the code is run in the Pocket simulator.<br><br>**Function kept for backward compatibility.** |
| [InSimulatorMode](../WDLang1/3014033.md) | Used to find out whether the application is started in "simulator test mode" from WINDEV Mobile. |
| [InUniversalWindowsAppMode](../WDLang1/1000022098.md) | Indicates whether the code is run in Universal Windows 10 App mode. |
| [InUniversalWindowsAppSimulatorMode](../WDLang1/1000022041.md) | Indicates whether the code is run in the simulator for the applications in Universal Windows 10 App mode. |
| [InWindowsMobileMode](../WDLang1/1000019657.md) | Indicates whether the code is run:<br><br>- from a Windows Mobile application.<br><br>- from a WINDEV application, from a WEBDEV site or from a PHP application.<br><br><br><br><br>**Function kept for backward compatibility.** |
| [InWindowsMode](../WDLang1/1000019614.md) | Indicates whether the code is run in Windows mode or not. |
