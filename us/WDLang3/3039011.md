## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000162"></a>
In this example, the application must manage a video conference between two computers. This application allows you to:

- view the video currently broadcasted by the web camera installed on the current computer.

- view the video currently broadcasted by the web camera installed on the connected computer.

- transmit the voice of the current user to the connected user.

- hear the voice of the connected user.




From version 20, Conference controls are supported in Windows Vista and later. If you want to use the Conference control with an earlier Windows version: 

1. Open the control description window. 

2. In the "UI" tab, check "Use the TAPI 3.x APIs / Windows XP (for compatibility)". 

3. Validate.

## Use example
<a name="use_example_ELTTEXTE000186"></a>
To develop this application: 

1. Create a blank window: 

	- Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_nouveau.gif)
 in the quick access buttons.

	- The creation window appears: click "Window" then "Window".




2. Create two Conference controls in this window: on the "Creation" tab, in the "Graphic controls" group, expand "Video and capture" and select "Conference". In our example, the first control is named "CONF_Reception" and the second control is named "CONF_Transmission".
	Remark: WINDEV automatically associates these two controls in the same stream. By default, the first created control is used to view the incoming video while the second created control is used to view the outgoing video.

3. Display the EVENTS associated with the stream ("Code of associated stream" in the context menu of one of the Conference controls).
	Reminder: The event "Request for connecting a new stream" is run when a new stream attempts to connect with the current application. This event accepts one parameter. To handle this parameter, a procedure is automatically declared in the "Request for connecting a new stream" event.

4. Add the following lines of code into the event "Request for connecting a new stream":
	
	```wl
	// Procedure used to detect a new stream 
	// nStreamID is an integer variable containing 
	// the identifier of the detected stream 
	PROCEDURE NewStream(nStreamID)  
	// Find out the name of the caller 
	CallerName is string = StreamInfo(nStreamID, StreamCallerName) 
	// Accept the incoming stream? 
	If YesNo(CallerName + "would like to start a conference with you", ...
		"Do you accept?") = Yes THEN
		StreamAccept(nStreamID, Reception) 
	ELSE     
		StreamReject(nStreamID) 
	END
	```


5. In the window:

	- create a button named "BTN_Call": on the "Creation" tab, in the "Usual controls" group, click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_bouton.gif)
. This button will be used to connect the stream to a recipient.

	- create an edit control named "EDT_RecipientAddress": on the "Creation" tab, in the "Usual controls" group, click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_saisie.gif)
. This control will be used to enter the name of the person called.

	- create a button named "BTN_Done": on the "Creation" tab, in the "Usual controls" group, click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_bouton.gif)
. This button will be used to end the reception or the broadcast of a stream.

	- create an edit control named "EDT_UserName": on the "Creation" tab, in the "Usual controls" group, click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_saisie.gif)
. This control will be used to enter the name of the current user.




6. Write the following code in the event "Click BTN_Call":
	
	```wl
	// Specify the name of the caller
	Stream1.Identifier = EDT_UserName 
	// Connect the stream 
	StreamConnect(Stream1, RecipientAddress) 
	// equivalent to: 
	// Stream1.Address = RecipientAddress
	```


7. Write the following lines of code in the event "Click BTN_Done":
	
	```wl
	// Disconnect the stream
	StreamDisconnect(Stream1)
	```





**Remark**: To operate, this application must run on two different computers.

Furthermore, with instant messaging, you have the ability to send a file to your contact and to dialog with him.
