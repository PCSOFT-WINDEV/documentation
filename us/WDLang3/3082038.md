Adds a list of files (of any type) into an archive in ZIP, CAB, WDZ or 7z, TAR ou TGZ (TAR.GZ) format and compresses it. This function is faster than [zipAddFile](../WDLang3/3082008.md) run for each file.

## Syntax

### Adding a list of files (files separated by CR)

`<Result> = zipAddFileList(<Archive> , <Path of files to add> [, <Path section to store> [, <Progress>]])`
---

**`<Result>: (entier)`**



- 0 if the addition was performed, 

- An error code (value greater than 0) otherwise. For more details on these error codes, see the [Remarks](#NOTE0_2).




**`<Archive>: (Character string or zipArchive variable)`**

Name of the archive into which the files will be added.
This name can correspond to:

- an archive name defined with [zipOpen](../WDLang3/3082044.md) or [zipCreate](../WDLang3/3082003.md).

- the name of a variable of type [zipArchive](../WDLang3/1000018679.md). 
	![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Variables of type [zipArchive](../WDLang3/1000018679.md) are not available in Java.




**`<Path of files to add>: (Character string)`**

Name and path of files to add into the archive, separated by CR characters. These paths can be full paths or paths relative to the current directory. The size of each path must not exceed 260 characters.
The size of each file must not exceed 4 GB. Otherwise, an error occurs.
You cannot use wildcard characters. 
![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![User code (UMC)](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/MCU.png) This parameter is of the form: 

```txt
<Chemin du fichier> [ + TAB + <Chemin à mémoriser> ] + RC
```
If the path to store is specified, the addition will be equivalent to a file addition followed by a call to [zipChangePath](../WDLang3/3082027.md).![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) The access path to the file is a full path or a path relative to the working directory of the application (returned by [fDataDir](../WDLang1/3036001.md)). Only the files found in the working directory can be added to the archive. 

**`<Path section to store>: (Optional constant)`**

Indicates the section of file paths that must be stored in the archive. This parameter is taken into account for the files for which &lt;Path to store&gt; was not specified. 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *zipDirectory* | Stores the different directories found in the file path as well as the file name and extension. For example: \\Directory\\Files\\FileName.pdf |
| *zipDrive*<br>(Default value) | Store the full and absolute path of file (name of disk, name of directories, file name and file extension). For example: C:\\Directory\\Files\\FileName.pdf<br>**For the ZIP format**: This constant has no effect.<br>**For the 7z format**: This constant and *zipDirectory* will have the same effect<br><br>![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png) This constant is not available as there is no root for the drive.![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This constant and *zipDirectory* will have the same effect. |
| *zipNone* | Stores the file name and extension. For example: FileName.pdf |


**If you are using an archive in .CAB format**, only the *zipNone* constant is taken into account. Indeed, the .CAB format cannot be used to store the paths inside the archive.

![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) This parameter is not available: only the file name and extension are stored.

**`<Progress>: (Control name or procedure name)`**

Progress bar management mode. This parameter can correspond to: 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) the name of a Progress Bar control found in a window. The progress bar will display the progress regarding the addition and the compression of all the files used.

- the name of a WLanguage procedure. For more details on this procedure, see [Parameters of the procedure used by zipAddFileList](../WDLang3/1000025731.md). 




**If you use a TAR or TGZ (TAR.GZ) archive**, the progress bar is refreshed only after the file is added. 

![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) This parameter is not available.

### Adding a list of files found in an array

`<Result> = zipAddFileList(<Archive> , <List of files> [, <Progress>])`
---

**`<Result>: (entier)`**

## Remarks


### Use condition
<a name="use_condition_ELTPARAGRAPHE000322"></a>

Adding files into an archive can be performed if:

- The archive exists (archives are created using [zipCreate](../WDLang3/3082003.md)).

- The archive is accessible in read/write.

- The archive is a single-part archive.

- The size of the file is less than 4 GB.




**Caution**:

- The full path of each file is stored in the archives in ZIP or WDZ format.

- **Archives in CAB format**: The files must be added immediately after the archive creation. This format cannot be used to add files into an existing archive.

- **Archives in RAR format**: This function is not available.

- **Archives in 7z format**: The archive is entirely compressed whenever **zipAddFileList** is called. 




The maximum number of files that can be included:

- in a WDZ file: 232-1. 

- in a ZIP file: 65535. 

- in a CAB file: 65535. 


Reminder: 

- ![Linux](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/LX.png)![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) Only ZIP, TAR and TGZ (TAR.GZ) archives are available.

- ![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) Only ZIP archives are available.



<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Compression level
<a name="compression_level_ELTPARAGRAPHE000389"></a>

The files added into a zip archive are compressed by default. The compression level of files added into an archive can be modified by [zipCompressionLevel](../WDLang3/3082054.md).
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Error codes
<a name="error_codes_ELTPARAGRAPHE000401"></a>

The following error codes are returned:

- 1: The path passed as parameter does not exist.

- 2: Access denied: the user has no sufficient rights or the file is currently used. If the file to insert is an HFSQL data file, it must be closed by the following code: 
	
	```txt
	HFerme(<Nom Fichier>)
	Multitâche(<Attente>) // Attend la fermeture effective du fichier
	```


- 3: The archive is corrupted.

- 4: The path does not exist in the archive.

- 5: Unable to write into the archive.

- 7: The file is already found in the archive.

- 8: An archive cannot be added to itself. For example, "MyArchive" cannot be added to "MyArchive".




The message corresponding to the error code is returned by [zipMsgError](../WDLang3/3082034.md).
<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### Adding a file that is already found in the archive
<a name="adding_file_that_already_found_the_archive_ELTPARAGRAPHE000425"></a>

An error occurs when adding a file that is already found in the archive. A file is identified by its stored path. Therefore, two files with the same name and with the same relative path cannot be added into an archive.
<a name="NOTE0_5"></a>


### Index of files in the archive
<a name="index_files_the_archive_ELTPARAGRAPHE000434"></a>

When a file is added into an archive, an index is automatically assigned to the file. This index corresponds to the order in which the files are included in the archive. To select a file in the archive, you can use:

- The subscript of the element (note: the index of an element is returned by [zipFindFile](../WDLang3/3082002.md)).

- The stored path of the element.
