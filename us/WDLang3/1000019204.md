<a name="description"></a>
Initializes the parameters of geolocation WLanguage functions and finds a location provider.

To define the device position, you have the ability to use two types of "location providers": 

- the network of GPS satellites.

- the triangulation performed from the network of mobile and Wi-Fi antennas. 




Each provider differs by the precision of its information, its energy consumption and the required hardware configuration (presence of a GPS chip, Internet access, etc.).

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`GPSInitParameter(<Provider to find> [, <Options>])`
---

**`<Provider to find>: (Integer constant)`**

Type of requested location provider.


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *gpsAuto* | Defines the most suitable provider according to the criteria specified in the &lt;Options&gt; parameter. |
| *gpsNetwork* | Calculates the position by using the network of mobile or Wi-Fi antennas. |
| *gpsSatellite* | Calculates the position by using the network of GPS satellites. |


![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) This parameter is ignored.

**`<Options>: (Optional combination of Integer constants)`**

Selection criteria for the location provider. 



The possible values are:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *gpsAltitude* | Indicates whether the provider must be able to specify the altitude of the device.<br><br>![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) This constant is not available. |
| *gpsDirection* | Indicates whether the provider must be able to specify the move direction of the device.<br><br>![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) This constant is not available. |
| *gpsEnergyHigh* | Indicates whether the provider can require a high quantity of energy.<br><br>![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) This constant is not available. |
| *gpsEnergyLow* | Indicates whether the provider must require a low quantity of energy.<br><br>![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) This constant is not available. |
| *gpsEnergyMedium* | Indicates whether the provider can require a medium quantity of energy.<br><br>![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) This constant is not available. |
| *gpsPrecisionHigh* | The position is calculated with high accuracy. |
| *gpsPrecisionLow* | The position is calculated with low accuracy. |
| *gpsSpeed* | Indicates whether the provider must be able to specify the moving speed.<br><br>![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) This constant is not available. |


Remarks: 

- The *gpsPrecisionxx* constants are exclusive between themselves. 

- The *gpsEnergyxx* constants are exclusive between themselves. 

- No constant is required. If no constant is specified, the function will search for a location provider that consumes the least amount of energy with any precision and without any specific characteristics.

## Remarks


### Special cases
<a name="special_cases_ELTPARAGRAPHE000164"></a>

- Depending on the type of device on which the application is started, there may be no provider corresponding to all the specified criteria (no GPS chip, no Internet access, ...). 
	If no providers correspond the specified criteria, these criteria are ignored one after the other until a valid provider is obtained according to the following order: energy consumption, accuracy, direction, speed and altitude.

- The geolocation functions can, according to the selected setting and to the call frequency, consume a lot of resources on the device (battery, bandwidth, etc.). [GPSEnd](../WDLang3/1000019210.md) must be called when the location functions are no longer used by the application.

- If a geolocation function is called, but the parameters have not yet been defined by **GPSInitParameter**, the application will try to use the GPS location first and then the mobile antenna network if the GPS system is not available.

- GPS functions cannot be used to perform an indoor geolocation: the positioning cannot be performed via Wi-Fi hotspots only.

### Required application feature
<a name="required_application_feature_ELTPARAGRAPHE000421"></a>

When this function is used, an application feature is declared in the application generation wizard.

Required feature: Geolocation

This feature allows the applications to access the geolocation features found on the device or on the computer.
