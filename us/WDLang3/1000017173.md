**Remarks**: 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Only the Microsoft stack and the Bluesoleil stack are supported.

- There is no need to sign the application to use the Bluetooth functions.




The Bluetooth Sockets can also be managed via the following functions: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| [SocketConnectBluetooth](../WDLang3/1000017145.md) | Connects a client computer to a specific Bluetooth socket. |
