The **btleCharacteristic** type is used to handle a characteristic of a Bluetooth Low Energy service. 

A characteristic is used to exchange data between two devices compatible with Bluetooth LE. It is identified by a unique character string (UUID) and it can contain a set of descriptors. A list of existing services and characteristics can be found on [https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/protocol-specifications](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/protocol-specifications).

The **btleCharacteristic** type is used by the [btleService](../WDLang3/1000022057.md) variables. 

The details of this characteristic can be defined and modified by several WLanguage properties. 

**Remark**: For more details on the declaration of this type of variable and the use of WLanguage properties, see [Declaring a variable](../Motscles/1514032.md).

The following properties can be used to handle a characteristic:

| Property name | Type used | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Descriptor | Array of [btleDescriptor](../WDLang3/1000022064.md) | List of descriptors associated with the characteristic. |
| Permission | Integer | Characteristic permissions.<br><br>![Windows](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WINDOWS.png) This property has no effect and is always set to 0. <br><br>This property is read-only. |
| Property | Integer | Characteristic properties.<br><br>This property is read-only. |
| UUID | Character string | Characteristic identifier.<br><br>This property is read-only. |
