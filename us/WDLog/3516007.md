## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000173"></a>
WDLog allows you to view the content of a log file:

- in HFSQL Classic mode. The file viewed in WDLog is &lt;NameLoggedFile>JNL.FIC.

- in HFSQL Client/Server mode. However, we recommend that you use the HFSQL Control Center.




Reminder: 

- The operating mode of the log process presents differences between HFSQL Classic and HFSQL Client/Server.

- In programming, [HHistoryModification](../WDLang4/3044344.md) returns the modifications made to one or more items of a given record.
