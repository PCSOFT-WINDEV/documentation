**You have now completed the tutorial!**

This tutorial covered a range of topics, but not all of WINDEV features, far from it!

You are now familiar with the main concepts.



You can also see the examples provided with WINDEV: some are simple and only address one topic, while others are more complex. These examples will show you the different aspects of WINDEV. Reading the source code is also a good way to learn.

It would take too much time to discuss all available topics (there are hundreds, even thousands!). 

WINDEV has many features that have not been covered in this tutorial:

- HTTP functions

- Office controls (Image editor, Word processing, Spreadsheet, etc.)

- creation of skin templates

- nested reports, queries with parameters

- dynamic compilation, calls to DLLs and more...




For more details, see the online help.



We hope you enjoy developing with **WINDEV 28**!
