## Introduction
<a name="introduction_ELTTEXTE000708"></a>
The development of a large IS system requires the participation of multiple developers. These developers must work on a single WINDEV project and share different resources (windows, classes, etc.).

WINDEV offers a Source Code Manager (SCM) used to share the source codes of different projects between developers and get the full history of changes in the code, interface, etc.

<a name="NOTE3"></a>
<a name="NOTE3_1"></a>


## SCM (Source Code Manager)
<a name="scm_source_code_manager_ELTTEXTE000732"></a>


### How the SCM works
<a name="how_the_scm_works_ELTPARAGRAPHE000040"></a>

The Source Code Manager is used to store and share projects and their elements.

The principle is as follows:

- A reference version of each of your projects is stored on a server. This set of versions is called "Repository".

- Each developer has a local copy of the different projects.  ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=GestionnaireDeSources1.gif)


- When developers want to make changes on the element of a project (window, report, query, etc.), they notify the SCM that they temporarily own this element. To do so, the developer will check out the element from the repository.

- This developer gets exclusive rights on this element: all the desired modifications can be performed on this element.

- The other developers continue to work on the copy of the reference version of the element (located in the repository).

- Once the developer has finished, the checked out element is checked back into the repository.

- The other developers are automatically notified of this check-in operation. They can now update their local copy.  ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=GestionnaireDeSources_synch.gif)



The SCM manages teamwork and allows you to get the history of all the changes. It can also be used to manage and control elements shared between multiple projects.

|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png)<br> | Note | You can also share source elements through GitHub. <br>The environment allows saving projects, windows, pages, reports, classes, sets of procedures and code in a Git repository. For more details, see [Share your projects via Git](../Editeurs/9500230.md). <br>However, it is recommended to use the SCM. In addition to text comparison, the SCM allows for rich object comparison (control properties, for example). An SCM-specific interface allows you to easily merge and compare elements. |




<a name="NOTE3_2"></a>


### Creating the repository
<a name="creating_the_repository_ELTPARAGRAPHE000074"></a>

To share a project via the Source Code Manager, a repository must be created. This repository must be created once only on the server.

This repository can be created:

- when installing WINDEV.

- when creating a project that uses the SCM.

- when importing a project into the SCM.

- whenever you want, from WINDEV directly or from the SCM administrator. 


The repository can be installed in the following modes:

- HFSQL Classic,

- HFSQL Client/Server,

- PCSCloud (paid turnkey solution). The PCSCloud mode allows you to access the sources of the projects from anywhere, at any time. This mode corresponds to a private Cloud (dedicated server) and offers numerous options (dedicated platform, Control Centers, etc.). For more details, see [PCSCloud](https://pcscloud.net/UK/cloud_development.awp).

- SCMDrive (paid turnkey solution). The SCMDrive mode allows you to access the sources of the projects from anywhere, at any time. This solution uses a shared server. For more details, see [SCMDrive](https://pcscloud-drive.net/UK/SCMDrive/index.awp).




- Our repository will be created when a project is imported into the SCM (next step).

| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png)<br> | Note | We advise you to make backup copies of the repository on a regular basis. To do so, simply: <br><br>- connect to the SCM management tool as administrator. <br><br>- on the "Management" tab, in the "Backups" group, select "Full backup".<br><br><br> |

## Checking a project into the SCM
<a name="checking_project_into_the_scm_ELTTEXTE000798"></a>


### Add project to SCM
<a name="add_project_scm_ELTPARAGRAPHE000125"></a>

To use an existing project with the Source Code Manager, simply add it to the repository. We will add our "WD Full Application" project. 



- Open the project you worked on in the previous lesson. 

	1. Go to the WINDEV home page (Ctrl + &lt;).

	2. On the home page, click "Tutorial", then in "Part 4 - Full application with data", double-click "Full application - Exercise".

	3. A dialogue box prompts you to open the project you worked on in the previous lesson. You can open the local copy or the original project. Select "Open the local copy". 





|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=exemple-WD.png)<br> | Answers | **A completed project is available. This project allows you to complete the different exercises in this lesson.** To open the completed project, go to the home page and click "Tutorial", then in "Part 4 - Full application with data", double-click "Full application - Answers". |







- We are now going to include the "WD Full Application.WDP" project in the repository:

	1. On the "SCM" tab, in the "Add project" group, click "Add project to SCM". The wizard for adding projects to the SCM appears: 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Int%E9gration%20dans%20le%20GDS%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.jpg&type=thumb)
The repository has not been created yet. We are going to create one.
			Remark: To make things easier, we will create a local HFSQL Classic repository on the development computer. The operation would be similar for another type of repository.
			|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png)<br> | Note | If the repository is in HFSQL Client/Server format, it can be used remotely. |





	2. Click "Local database". 

	3. The repository creation window appears.  
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Int%E9gration%20dans%20le%20GDS%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.jpg&type=thumb)


	4. Specify the repository directory (e.g., "C:\\My Projects\\SCM Local repository).

5. Validate the creation of the repository ("Create repository").

6. The new repository is automatically selected in wizard. We will add our project to this repository.

7. Go to the next step.

8. The wizard proposes to locate the project in the "WINDEV projects" subdirectory of the repository. 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Int%E9gration%20dans%20le%20GDS%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.jpg&type=thumb)
Accept this location. Go to the next step.

9. Select the project elements that will be added to the repository. 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Int%E9gration%20dans%20le%20GDS%20-%20HC%20N%B0004.jpg&type=thumb)
Add all project elements. Go to the next step.

10. The wizard asks you to select the project dependencies that will be added to the repository. These dependencies correspond to all external elements required by the project (images, style sheets, etc.).
			Add all project dependencies. Go to the next step.

11. Validate the project integration in the SCM. The project and its elements have been added to the repository.
			|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png)<br> | Note | **Sharing project elements**<br><br>When the projects that share the same resources (same analysis, same windows, etc.) are included in the SCM, the relevant elements can be shared between the different projects. Therefore, the same element is checked in only once and the modifications are automatically applied to the other projects. |







<a name="NOTE4_2"></a>


### Opening a project from the SCM
<a name="opening_project_from_the_scm_ELTPARAGRAPHE000199"></a>

In our example, the project is checked into the SCM and can be used directly.

**In a real case, in order for other developers to work on a project located in the Source Code Manager, they must get a copy of this project locally.**

To do so, follow these steps:

1. Open the project from the Source Code Manager: on the "Home" tab, in the "General" group, expand "Open" and select "Open a project from the SCM".

2. Specify the location parameters of the repository and validate (this step is required only if the current project in the editor does not belong to the SCM):  
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Int%E9gration%20dans%20le%20GDS%20-%20HC%20N%B0005.jpg&type=thumb)


3. In the screen that is displayed, specify (if necessary) the connection and the local directory:  
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Int%E9gration%20dans%20le%20GDS%20-%20HC%20N%B0006.jpg&type=thumb)



**Remark**: If the project was already opened from the SCM, the SCM proposes to open the project as usual or to overwrite the content (to retrieve the entire project). This operation must be performed only once by each developer who uses the project. The developer who added the project to the Source Code Manager (you in this case) has no operations to perform.|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png)<br> | Note | Next time, you will be able to open a project included in the SCM as any other project: all you have to do is open the project (".WDP" file) corresponding to the local copy. |




<a name="NOTE4_3"></a>


### Configuring the SCM
<a name="configuring_the_scm_ELTPARAGRAPHE000235"></a>

Before you start working on the elements of the project included in the SCM, you must configure the mode for checking out the project elements.

When working on the elements of a project in the SCM, the element must be checked out from the repository before it can be modified, then it must be checked back in once the changes have been made. Therefore, the modified element becomes available to all SCM users.

**WINDEV proposes two modes for checking out the project elements**:

- **standard mode**: if you open an element that has not been checked out from the SCM, a panel indicates that the element must be checked out to modify it. The element can be checked out immediately (check-out button found in the dialog box).

- **automatic mode**: if you try to modify an element that has not yet been checked out, the SCM automatically prompts you to check it out. Once the check-out is validated, the element can be modified.
	**Remark**: this mode is not recommended when using the SCM with a slow Internet connection.




**The automatic check-out will be used in this tutorial**.



- To make sure the automatic check-out is enabled, go to the "Home" tab, "Environment" group, expand "Options" and select "General options of WINDEV". On the "General" tab, in the "" section, select "".




<a name="NOTE5"></a>
<a name="NOTE5_1"></a>


## Handling the project via SCM
<a name="handling_the_project_via_scm_ELTTEXTE000906"></a>
We will work with the SCM in real conditions by performing the following operations:

- Modify a project option.

- Modify a project window.



<a name="NOTE5_2"></a>


### Modifying a project option
<a name="modifying_project_option_ELTPARAGRAPHE000291"></a>



- We will apply the skin template on the system windows:

	1. Open the project description: on the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, click "Description".

	2. Click the "Style" tab.

	3. Check "Customize system windows (Info, YesNo, Confirm, Dialog)".

	4. Validate the project description window.







- Several SCM windows appear:

	1. First, the automatic project check-out window is displayed. To change a project feature, it must be checked out.  
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Int%E9gration%20dans%20le%20GDS%20-%20HC%20N%B0007.jpg&type=thumb)


	2. The "Check in the project automatically at the end of the operation" option checks the project in once all changes have been made. Keep this option. 

3. Validate this window.

4. Different check-in and check-out windows open allowing you to add the internal component "WDFAA.wci" and its elements to the project in the repository and extract them to the local project. This component contains the different system windows to customize. Validate these different windows. 

5. The project description window is closed and the project is automatically checked back into the repository. 



<a name="NOTE5_3"></a>


### Modifying a project window
<a name="modifying_project_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000334"></a>

We are now going to modify the "WIN_Product_form" window: we should be able to modify the image by clicking on it (like the "Modify" button).

A checked-out element (UI, code, etc.) can be modified as any other element of a project that is not included in the SCM. 

However, the other developers cannot see the changes made to the element. 

If other developers need to work on the checked-out element, they will use the one in the repository. 

This allows you to make an application evolve while keeping a stable version in the repository.

- To modify the "WIN_Product_form" window:

	1. Select the "WIN_Product_form" window in the project explorer and double-click the element to open it in the window editor.  
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Int%E9gration%20dans%20le%20GDS%20-%20HC%20N%B0008.jpg&type=thumb)


	2. Automatic check-out is enabled when the first change is made: simply move a control to check out the element. You can also click the "Check out" icon in the ribbon (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Int%E9gration%20dans%20le%20GDS%20-%20HC%20N%B0008%201.jpg)
).

3. The check-out window is displayed:  
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Int%E9gration%20dans%20le%20GDS%20-%20HC%20N%B0009.jpg&type=thumb)




- Test your changes.

	1. Test the project (click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_GO_Projet_WD_GAF.jpg)
 in the quick access buttons).

	2. Select a product and click "Modify".

	3. In the form that is displayed, click the product image: the file picker is opened to modify the product image. This is the expected operating mode.

	4. Close the test window.






<a name="NOTE5_4"></a>


### Checking the checked-out element back in
<a name="checking_the_checkedout_element_back_ELTPARAGRAPHE000387"></a>

Now that the modifications have been made and tested, we are going to check the window back into the repository. The other developers will be able to access your changes.



- On the "SCM" tab, in the "Current element" group, click "Check in". The following window appears: 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Int%E9gration%20dans%20le%20GDS%20-%20HC%20N%B0010.jpg&type=thumb)
This window is used to:

	- view the changes made by comparing the element from the repository with the checked out element ("My changes...").
			|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png)<br> | Note | **Merging code**<br><br>You can compare an element with one of its earlier versions. This allows you to compare the code in order to retrieve a code section that was "lost" or accidentally deleted by another developer. |





	- access the history of the element in the repository ("Properties...").

	- write a comment about the changes made. By default, WINDEV proposes the comment typed during the check-out.

	- send a message to the other developers.

	- check in the changes made while keeping the element checked out ("Keep element checked out" option).
			|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png)<br> | Note | If you are using the Control Centers, the current task can be ended when the element is checked back into the Source Code Manager. This feature is useful to monitor tasks, fix bugs, etc. |











- Validate the check-in window. The window is displayed in the editor.



<a name="NOTE5_5"></a>


### Synchronizing the project
<a name="synchronizing_the_project_ELTPARAGRAPHE000443"></a>

Multiple options can be used to configure a project handled by the SCM. These options are grouped in the "SCM" tab of the project description (to open it, click "Description" on the "Project" tab).  
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Int%E9gration%20dans%20le%20GDS%20-%20HC%20N%B0011.jpg&type=thumb)


These options are as follows:

- **Propose to get the latest version of the elements when the project is opened**.
	When opening a project located in the SCM, this option prompts you to get the latest version of the project elements.

- **Suggest checking the elements back in when the project is closed**.
	When the project is closed, this option displays a list of the checked out elements to check some or all of them back in.
	By default, when the project is closed, the checked out elements are not checked back in.

- **Check out/Check in the project automatically**.
	This option allows you to automatically check out or check in the project when using an element.
	This option is selected by default.



<a name="NOTE5_6"></a>


### Offline mode
<a name="offline_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000485"></a>

The SCM allows you to work in offline mode. This mode allows a developer (who uses a laptop, for example) to continue working on a project in the repository while being offline.

The principle is simple:

- before disconnecting, go to the "SCM" tab, "Other actions" group, expand "Remote work" and select "Disconnect to work offline".

- on reconnection, on the "SCM" tab, in the "Other actions" group, expand "Remote work" and select "Reconnect and synchronize". Then, simply check the modified elements back in.




In offline mode, there are two options when it comes to checking out elements:

- Not checking out any elements from the SCM. The other developers will be able to work on the same elements as you while you are working in offline mode. When you reconnect to the SCM, the changes you made on the element must be merged with the changes made by other developers.

- Checking out the elements in exclusive mode. No one else can use the element while you are working in offline mode.



<a name="NOTE5_7"></a>


### SCM administrator
<a name="scm_administrator_ELTPARAGRAPHE000528"></a>

The SCM administrator is used to directly handle the different projects included in the source code manager.

It allows you to:

- manage repositories (create or connect to a repository).

- manage files and directories located in a project in the repository (add, delete, rename files and directories, etc.).

- manage the different files of the repository (check-out, check-in, share, etc.). 

- start some tools (options, maintenance, etc.).

- view the history of an element.

- view the status of the elements.

- perform backups.

- grant rights to the different SCM users.

- list the projects you want to dissociate from (if necessary).




- Start the SCM administrator: on the "SCM" tab, in the "Repository" group, click "Manage". All project elements are listed in the administrator.  
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Int%E9gration%20dans%20le%20GDS%20-%20HC%20N%B0012.jpg&type=thumb)






<a name="NOTE5_8"></a>


### Disconnecting from the SCM
<a name="disconnecting_from_the_scm_ELTPARAGRAPHE000574"></a>

In the rest of this tutorial, we will use the "WD Full Application" project. To simplify the operations, it is recommended to disconnect from the SCM:

1. Open the project description window: on the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, click "Description".

2. In the "SCM" tab, select "No SCM or external manager (GIT)".

3. Validate the project description window.
