## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000471"></a>
We have created a full application that allowed us to discover multiple WINDEV features. We will generate the executable and then, install the application on the users' computers. That's what we will do to complete this part. At the end of this part, you will be familiar with the main concepts for developing a WINDEV application.




- Open the project you worked on in the previous lesson. 

	1. Go to the WINDEV home page (Ctrl + &lt;).

	2. On the home page, click "Tutorial", then in "Part 4 - Full application with data", double-click "Full application - Exercise".

	3. A dialogue box prompts you to open the project you worked on in the previous lesson. You can open the local copy or the original project. Select "Open the local copy".

## Creating the executable
<a name="creating_the_executable_ELTTEXTE000513"></a>
It is very easy to create the executable: you will only need to go through one option and a few clicks.

We will present in detail the different steps for creating the executable. You can click the "Finish" button to validate all the steps of the wizard at any time.

- To create the executable:

	1. Expand ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_Icones%20WD%20-%20HC%20N%B0002%201_GAF.jpg)
 in the quick access area, and select "Generate 64-bit Windows executable (.exe)".  
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_D%E9ployer%20l'application%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.jpg)

			|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png)<br> | Note | WINDEV also allows you to create 64-bit executables, Linux executables, services, Java applications and more. |





	2. The executable creation wizard starts. 

	3. Describe the general options of the executable:

		- the executable name: we will keep the default name.

		- the name of icon associated with the executable: you have the ability to select an icon in the image catalog.

		- the splash screen. Several types of splash screens are available. 
						
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_D%E9ployer%20l'application%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.jpg&type=thumb)



 Keep "No splash screen" and go to the next step. 

4. Keep the default options for the operating mode of the executable. Go to the next step.

5. You can customize the application error message. We will keep the default message. Go to the next step.

6. The wizard proposes to enable the telemetry in the application. We won't use this feature. Go to the next step.
			|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png)<br> | Note | Telemetry allows you to get detailed statistics about the use of your application by the end users. It shows you a report of the deployed applications, so you can improve them.<br><br> |





7. This step is used to specify whether the executable will take the patches into account.
			|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png)<br> | Note | To avoid providing the entire executable again when you make changes to the application, you can distribute the additional resources (windows, reports, etc.) as patches. Patches are additional libraries.<br><br>If the "Yes: the executable will take these updates by patch into account" option was checked when the executable was created, the elements in the patch will replace the elements in the application library when the application starts.<br><br> |



Keep the default options. Go to the next step.

8. This step allows you to define the executable languages. The multilingual feature will be presented in another lesson. Keep the default options. Go to the next step.

9. This step displays all files that will be included in the executable library. Those are the project elements that can be handled by the end user. Keep the default options. Go to the next step.

10. This step concerns the directory of HFSQL Classic data files used by the application. 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_D%E9ployer%20l'application%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.jpg&type=thumb)
Select "Automatic (recommended)" if necessary. This option is used to install the data files: 

	- in the application data directory (if the executable is installed in "Program files"). 

	- in the executable directory. 




That's it, the executable has been created. In this first configuration, we defined several options, but next time you will be able to validate all the steps of the wizard from the beginning.|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png)<br> | Note | You can also select a specific step in the wizard to access it directly. The default options of the other steps will be automatically validated. |

## Creating the setup
<a name="creating_the_setup_ELTTEXTE000663"></a>
The setup is created via a wizard. This wizard allows you to define the main choices. You can also use the setup editor if the options proposed by the wizard are not suitable. We will not go into its details in this lesson. For more details, see [The WDInst setup editor](../Editeurs/2028042.md).

We will now present the different steps for creating the setup program. You can click the "Finish" button to validate all the steps of the wizard at any time.



- To create the setup program:

	1. On the "Project" tab, in the "Generation" group, expand "Setup procedure" and select "Create setup procedure". The executable and setup creation wizard starts.

	2. The executable has already been created: the selected options were saved. 

	3. In the wizard, click "Additional information" in the "Executable" section.

	4. The wizard proposes to make a backup copy of the project. Select "No: Don't make a backup copy of the project" and go to the next step.

	5. The wizard proposes to create the new features page. 
			
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_D%E9ployer%20l'application%20-%20HC%20N%B0005%20b.jpg&type=thumb)
This option is used to create a help file in order to present the new features to the end users. During the first setup, it can be the software help.
			Select "Create a documentation for the new features" and go to the next step.

	6. You have the ability to define the elements that will be automatically included in the help file. Keep the default options and go to the next step.
			|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png)<br> | Note | If the application already contains a help system, you can use it and include the new features page in it. |





	7. Validate the message and the help file save window. 

	8. The executable is automatically created (with the options defined when creating the first executable) as well as the help system. You can enter specific information in the help system. In this case, keep the default information. To resume the creation of the setup program, click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_D%E9ployer%20l'application%20-%20HC%20N%B0005%201.jpg)
, which corresponds to "Continue the creation of the setup procedure". 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_D%E9ployer%20l'application%20-%20HC%20N%B0005.jpg)
The help is automatically compiled.

	9. Let's now go to the "Setup" section of the wizard. In this first screen, choose the setup mode:

		- Individual setup for an independent application, installed and started on each computer. We will choose this option.

		- Setup with automatic update, for a setup on a server. The applications will be installed from the server. If an update is available, only the server must be updated. The applications installed on the computers will be automatically updated.

		- Setup on a Private Store, to deploy the setup to a previously defined Private Store. Users will be able to install the application from the Store. 


 Go to the next step.

10. Choose a standard setup. Go to the next step.

11. We will not change the default installation directory. Go to the next step.

12. Keep the files that appear in the list of installed files. By default, WINDEV shows the Executable file and the help file (created by the new features help). We are going to add the data files:

	- Click "Add". The Windows explorer displays the content of the application generation directory.

	- Select the Customer, Order, OrderLine, PaymentMode and Product data files (files with ".fic", ".ndx" and ".mmo" extension).

	- Validate. The files are automatically saved in the application data directory.  
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_D%E9ployer%20l'application%20-%20HC%20N%B0006.jpg&type=thumb)

<a name="NOTE5_1"></a>


## Installing an application
<a name="installing_application_ELTTEXTE000741"></a>
In the last setup creation window, click "Test". If you closed this window, run the "Install.exe" program located in the setup program directory. The application setup starts.



- We will go through the different steps of the "WD Full Application" setup program.

	1. On Windows Vista (or later), a window requests the authorization to run the program. Validate this window.

	2. The setup wizard starts.

| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png)<br> | Note | You can change the setup language via a combo box at the upper-right corner of the wizard.  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_D%E9ployer%20l'application%20-%20HC%20N%B0008.jpg)<br> |




			Two setup modes are available: 

		- Quick setup: The setup is performed with the parameters specified by the application provider. 

		- Custom setup: The wizard asks the user to define the parameters of the application setup. 




3. Choose "Custom setup". The wizard asks for the application installation directory.  
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_D%E9ployer%20l'application%20-%20HC%20N%B0009.jpg&type=thumb)

## The different types of deployment
<a name="the_different_types_deployment_ELTTEXTE000783"></a>
We have just completed a simple application deployment. In the setup creation wizard, WINDEV also proposes setups with automatic update.
<a name="NOTE6_2"></a>


### Overview
<a name="overview_ELTPARAGRAPHE000303"></a>

Several setup modes are available for a WINDEV application:

- **Stand-alone setup**:
	This type of setup is used to create a unique setup program. This setup program will be run by the end users from their computers.
	To update the application, you will have to re-create a setup for the application. Then, the end user will have to install this new program.
	This is the type of setup that we have just created.

- **Setup with automatic update**:
	This type of setup is used to automatically detect the updates when starting the application. If an update is available, users can update immediately.
	This type of setup is available over the network or from the Internet. You can also create a multisite setup. 




We will see how to create a setup with updates.
<a name="NOTE6_3"></a>


### Setup with update over the network
<a name="setup_with_update_over_the_network_ELTPARAGRAPHE000325"></a>

The setup program is created via a specific wizard (on the "Project" tab, in the "Generation" group, click "Setup procedure").

The setup program obtained at the end of the wizard includes two setups:

- the setup of the reference application. The reference application must be installed on the network (in a shared directory or on a server for example), accessible to all the end users of the application.

- the application setup itself. This setup is included in the reference application. It can be accessed once the reference application is installed.




The diagram below presents the setup mode of an application that uses a local HFSQL Classic database, with a network update.  
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P3-Installation%20avec%20mise%20%E0%20jour%20r%E9seau-En%20Ligne.gif&type=thumb)


The version of the reference application is automatically checked each time the end user starts the application. If this version has changed (e.g., if the reference version has been updated), an update of the final application is automatically proposed.
<a name="NOTE6_4"></a>


### Setup with update from the Internet
<a name="setup_with_update_from_the_internet_ELTPARAGRAPHE000354"></a>

The same principle is used by the setup with Internet update.

The setup program is created via a specific wizard (on the "Project" tab, in the "Generation" group, click "Setup procedure").

The setup program obtained at the end of the wizard includes:

- the setup of the reference application and the Web page used to download the client setup. These elements must be installed on an HTTP server.

- the application setup itself. This setup is included in the reference application. It can be accessed once the reference application has been installed, via the download Web page.




The diagram below presents the setup mode of an application that uses an HFSQL Client/Server database, with an internet update.  
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P3-Installation%20avec%20mise%20%E0%20jour%20internet-En%20Ligne.gif&type=thumb)


Remark: This type of setup can also be done via [PCSCloud](https://pcscloud.net/UK/cloud_development.awp) (if you have an account). 
<a name="NOTE6_5"></a>


### Multisite setup
<a name="multisite_setup_ELTPARAGRAPHE000388"></a>

The multisite setup combines:

- a reference network setup deployed on a local network.

- an HTTP setup used to update the reference setup on the local network.
