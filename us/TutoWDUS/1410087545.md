## What is an audit?
<a name="what_audit_ELTTEXTE000412"></a>
Audits provide a set of features used to:

- automatically improve the quality and performance of a project.

- monitor how it is put into production.




Two types of audits are available:

- **The static audit**. The static audit analyzes a project and its elements. This audit is performed from the project editor.

- **The dynamic audit**. The dynamic audit analyzes the behavior of a project during its execution. This audit can be performed in test mode or in the production environment.




We will run these audits on the "WD Optimization" project.

## Static audit
<a name="static_audit_ELTTEXTE000436"></a>
The static audit is a feature of the environment used to analyze the source code of a project in order to detect various problems and to propose improvements.



- To start the static audit on the "WD Optimization" project:

	1. On the "Project" tab, in the "Audit and performance" group, expand "Static audit" and select "Start static audit".
			|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png)<br> | Note | The static audit of the project can also be started from the project dashboard, via the "Static audit and Compilation" widget. <br><br>Simply:<br><br>		- enable the widget if necessary (click the link "Click here to re-enable").<br><br>		- click the arrow. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P6_Audit%20statique%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.jpg)<br><br><br><br> |





	2. The wizard starts. We will define the target of the static audit. 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P6_Audit%20statique%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.jpg&type=thumb)


	3. Select "Run the static audit on the entire project".

4. Validate the wizard.

5. The audit report is displayed: 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P6_Audit%20statique%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.jpg&type=thumb)


The static audit includes:

- The static audit of the project.

- The audit of the content of the application library.

- The audit of the setup content.




- Let's take a closer look at the points presented in this report.



<a name="NOTE3_2A"></a>


### Table control (UI)
<a name="table_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000087"></a>

In our project, the audit indicates that a Table control uses the standard search mode. This mode ('Starts with') searches for elements that start with the given characters. The audit recommends using a 'Contains' filter for the search by default. 

The lifecycle of some WINDEV projects span several years. Often, these projects use features that date from the time the project was created (technologies that are now outdated, or that have been replaced by more secure alternatives), options that have become useless or inefficient. 

In this example, the Table control uses a 'Starts with' search that can be replaced with a 'Contains' search, which is much more common and practical for users.  

- To fix this problem:

	1. Click the [...] button to get more details. A window with UI improvement suggestions appears. 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P6_Audit%20statique%20-%20HC%20N%B0006.jpg)


	2. In "WIN_UnusedWindow", the "TABLE_Product" control can be improved. This window is used to:

	- make the improvement ("Improve"). In this case, the improvement is made immediately. 

	- ignore the improvement ("Ignore"). In this case, the improvement suggestion will no longer appear. 




- In the static audit window, click the "Refresh" button to update the audit report.



<a name="NOTE3_2"></a>


### Procedure not run
<a name="procedure_not_run_ELTPARAGRAPHE000117"></a>

In our project, the audit indicates that a procedure is never run.

In large projects, you may want to create one or more procedures to perform a process then, further to a code reorganization, the procedure is no longer used but it remains in the project. These unused procedures unnecessarily overload the resources distributed to end-users.

- To fix this problem:

	1. Click the [...] button to get more details. The window that lists the dead code opens. 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P6_Audit%20statique%20-%20HC%20N%B0004.jpg)


	2. The "ObsoleteProcedure" procedure is never called. This window is used to:

	- specify that the procedure is still used ("Mark as useful"). In this case, the procedure will no longer be taken into account in the audit.

	- delete the procedure if it is not used ("Delete").

	- see the procedure ("View").

	- find the occurrences in the strings ("Search").




- In the static audit window, click the "Refresh" button to update the audit report.



<a name="NOTE3_3"></a>


### Orphan element
<a name="orphan_element_ELTPARAGRAPHE000168"></a>

The audit indicates that our project contains an orphan element.

Just like with procedures, windows or reports can be created to run a quick test, then be saved and forgotten. The presence of orphan elements in the executable unnecessarily consumes the resources distributed to the end users.

- To fix this problem:

	1. Click the [...] button to get more details. The window that lists the orphan elements is displayed. 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P6_Audit%20statique%20-%20HC%20N%B0005.jpg)


	2. The "WIN_UnusedWindow" window is never called. The window that lists the orphan elements is used to:

	- specify that the element is still used ("Mark as useful"). In this case, the window will no longer be taken into account in the audit. This option can be useful when using a test window specific to the development for example.

	- delete the element if it is actually unused ("Delete").

	- see the element ("View").

	- find the occurrences in the strings ("Search").




- In the static audit window, click the "Refresh" button to update the audit report.



<a name="NOTE3_4"></a>


### Cleaning the project
<a name="cleaning_the_project_ELTPARAGRAPHE000218"></a>

Our project contains multiple files that are not used. You can clean the project to keep the necessary elements only. The executable and the setup client are not overloaded with unused images, external files (or other).

- To fix this problem:

	1. Click the [...] button to get more details.

	2. The project cleanup wizard starts. This wizard shows the unused files that can be deleted.

	3. Go to the next step.

	4. Select the type of cleanup. You can:

		- create a zip file with the unused files.

		- move the unused files to a specific directory.




5. Validate the option proposed by default and go to the next step.

6. Finish the wizard.




Our project has been optimized by following all the tips of the static audit.

The static audit is used to get an overall status on the source code of your project. Our advice: run it on a regular basis!

Let's see what happens at runtime when the dynamic audit is started.

<a name="NOTE4"></a>
<a name="NOTE4_1"></a>


## Dynamic audit
<a name="dynamic_audit_ELTTEXTE000502"></a>
The dynamic audit is used to analyze the application execution. The audit detects problems such as:

- Excessive memory consumption,

- Slowness of algorithms used,

- Errors "hidden" at runtime, 

- etc.


A dynamic audit can be performed in a test environment or on a live application.

The "WD Optimization" project contains a specific window triggering errors that can be detected by the dynamic audit.

The dynamic audit and the project test will be started at the same time.

- To start the dynamic audit on the "WD Optimization" project:

	1. On the "Project" tab, in the "Test mode" group, expand "Test mode" and select "Debug project while the audit is enabled". The project test is run.

| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png)<br> | Note | The dynamic audit of the project can also be started from the project dashboard, via the "Dynamic audit" widget. To do so:<br><br>		- enable the widget if necessary (click the link "Click here to re-enable").<br><br>		- expand the arrow and select "In-depth project test (Go)". <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P6_Audit%20dynamique%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.jpg)<br><br><br><br>Remark: The dynamic audit is automatically run each time the application is tested via the GO option. A report is automatically displayed in the project dashboard: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P6_Audit%20dynamique%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.jpg)<br> |





	2. Click the "Test window of dynamic audit" button.

	3. Click the different buttons in the window. At the end of each process, a toast message is displayed to specify that the process is over. For the "Assertion and Exception" option, an assertion is displayed: click "Continue" to see the message appear as a toast.

	4. Stop the application test.

	5. The report window of the dynamic audit appears.






![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P6_Audit%20dynamique%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.jpg&type=thumb)


- Let's analyze this window:

	- The top section of this window allows you to choose the data display options. You can:

		- choose a chronological display (based on the order in which the events occurred) or an overall display, used to group the different types of issues. In this case, the timeline allows you to see the position and importance of the problems.

		- choose the type of issue to be displayed (error, assertion, etc.). This allows you to focus on major errors, etc.




- The bottom section of this window displays the different events that occurred and that may cause problems in the application.




- In this example, the dynamic audit detects several problems:

	- An overly long text assigned programmatically,

	- A SWITCH loop for which no CASE is run,

	- An assertion is triggered instead of an exception,

	- Opening a file that does not exist,

	- The assignment of a nonexistent image file to an Image control.


 For each problem, a "..." button allows you to access the details of the event. If the event is linked to a specific line of code, the ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P6_Audit%20dynamique%20-%20HC%20N%B0002%201.jpg)
 button allows you to open the code editor directly at the corresponding location in order to fix the problem.




- Close the dynamic audit window.
