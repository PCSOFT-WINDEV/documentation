## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000246"></a>
WINDEV allows you to print your data:

- through programming.

- via reports. A report is a graphic representation of a document. Reports are created in the report editor.




WINDEV offers several types of reports:

- Blank,

- Form,

- Table,

- Crosstab,

- TreeView Table,

- Gantt Chart,

- Organizer or scheduler,

- Spreadsheet,

- Mailing,

- Label,

- Report based on form,

- Multicolumn report,

- Composite report.




We will now explain how to create the different types of reports in "WD Full Application".



- Open the project you worked on in the previous lesson.

	1. Go to the WINDEV home page (Ctrl + &lt;).

	2. On the home page, click "Tutorial", then in "Part 4 - Full application with data", double-click "Full application - Exercise".

	3. A dialogue box prompts you to open the project you worked on in the previous lesson. You can open the local copy or the original project. Select "Open the local copy".

## Printing the content of a Table control
<a name="printing_the_content_table_control_ELTTEXTE000288"></a>
In the previous lesson, we created a Table control to display the result of a multi-criteria search. Let's take a look at the different methods used to print the content of this Table control.

### Printing directly via the AAFs (Automatic Application Features)
<a name="printing_directly_via_the_aafs_automatic_application_features_ELTPARAGRAPHE000071"></a>

In previous lessons, we discovered that WINDEV includes several automatic features (called AAF). One AAF allows you to print the content of a Table control.|   |   |   |

| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png)<br> | Note | A list of the most common AAFs (Automatic Application Features) can be found in WINDEV AAF 28.PDF. This file is automatically included in your application if you choose the "AAF help" option when creating the automatic menu. |






- Let's run a quick test:

	1. Open "WIN_Menu" in the window editor.

	2. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_GO_Fenetre_WD_GAF.jpg)
 in the quick access buttons.

	3. Select the "Find orders" tab if necessary.

	4. Define the different search parameters:

		- Order status,

		- Payment method,

		- Range of dates to take into account.




5. Click "Find".

6. When the data is displayed in the Table control, open the context menu of the control (click the 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_MenuCtx_Table.gif)
 icon at the top right or right-click the control).  
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Application%20compl%E8te%20-%20Imprimer%20contenu%20Table%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.jpg&type=thumb)




You want to customize the default report? Simply create an automatic report based on the Table control. If the report exists, it will be automatically used by the option for printing the Table control.

### Creating an automatic report based on a Table control
<a name="creating_automatic_report_based_table_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000118"></a>

If you want to create a report to print the data from a Table control, simply create a "Report based on a Table control": the report corresponding to the Table control is automatically created.



- To create a "Report based on a Table control":

	1. Open the "Find orders" tab pane in the window editor.

	2. On the "Creation" tab, in the "Data" group, expand "Table and List Box" and select "Report based on a Table control".

	3. Since this window contains 2 Table controls on different tab panes, WINDEV prompts you to select the desired Table control. In our case, select "TABLE_QRY_FindOrders" and validate.

	4. The shape of a Button control appears under the mouse cursor. This control is automatically created and it contains the WLanguage code used to print the content of the Table control. 

	5. Click where you want to create the control in the window (e.g., below the "Find" button, in the "Find orders" tab pane).

	6. The report is automatically created.

	7. A window to save the report appears. Validate.

	8. The report editor appears with the report that was automatically created.

	9. In this report, you will find the titles of the Table control columns from the window. We will make changes to this report: we will change the title. 

	- Select the control that corresponds to the report title ("QRY_FindOrders Table") and double-click on it.

	- In the description window, modify the caption and enter "Sought orders".

	- Validate.
