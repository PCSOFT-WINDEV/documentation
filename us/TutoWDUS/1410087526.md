## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000233"></a>
In most cases, a Web service is defined as an application that can be accessed via standard Internet protocols. More specifically, Web services allow several computers connected via Internet to interact.

Web services allow you to run procedures and processes on a remote Web server (.NET, SOAP or J2EE) from a client computer.

With WINDEV, these Web services can be used as client, via the SOAP protocol on HTTP (the standard Internet protocol for transferring HTML pages), with the SOAPxx, DotNetxx and J2EExx functions.

Regardless of the Web server platform (.NET, J2EE, etc.), a Web service can be accessed via the SOAP protocol.|   |   |   |

### Practical example
<a name="practical_example_ELTPARAGRAPHE000038"></a>

A Webservice specific to this tutorial allows you to try the different operations that can be performed on a Webservice.

When integrated to the "WD Full Application" project, this Webservice is used to query a supplier database to check whether a product is available in stock using its reference.

In a first time, the Webservice will be imported into the "WD Full Application" project then it will be used in the application to check the product availability from a Product form.

- Open the project you worked on in the previous lesson. 

	1. Go to the WINDEV home page (Ctrl + &lt;).

	2. On the home page, click "Tutorial", then in "Part 4 - Full application with data", double-click "Full application - Exercise".

	3. A dialogue box prompts you to open the project you worked on in the previous lesson. You can open the local copy or the original project. Select "Open the local copy".

To open the completed project, go to the home page and click "Tutorial", then in "Part 4 - Full application with data", double-click "Full application - Answers". |







- Go to the "Windows 32-bit executable" configuration: in the "Project explorer" pane, in the "Configurations" folder, double-click "Windows 32-bit executable".

## Importing a Webservice
<a name="importing_webservice_ELTTEXTE000299"></a>


- To import a Webservice into the project:

	1. On the "Project" tab, in the "Project" group, expand "Import" and select "A Webservice".

	2. The import wizard starts. Go to the next step.

	3. Specify the address into which the WSDL description of the Webservice must be imported: 
			
		```txt
		https://examples.webdev.info/WSTUTORIALV2_WEB/awws/WSTutorialV2.awws?wsdl
		```

			Reminder: This Webservice is used to query a supplier database to check the availability (stock) of a product using its reference.

	4. Go to the next step. The Webservice is imported.  
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Consommation%20WS%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.jpg&type=thumb)




Let's take a closer look at the information displayed in the "Project explorer" pane: 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Consommation%20WS%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.jpg)
The structure includes:

- the Webservice name (WSTutorialV2 in this example),

- the name of each function (ProductInStock in this example).




To see the Webservice call syntax, double-click the name of the function in the "Project explorer" pane. The code editor displays the function description, with the prototype for calling the function:  
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Consommation%20WS%20-%20HC%20N%B0004.jpg&type=thumb)

## Consuming a Webservice
<a name="consuming_webservice_ELTTEXTE000323"></a>
In our "WD Full Application" example, the call to the Webservice will be included in the tab used to see the list of products. An "In stock?" button will allow you to check whether the product displayed via the Webservice is available.



- To use the Webservice:

	1. Open the "WIN_Menu" window in the editor (double-click its name in the "Project explorer" pane, for example).

	2. Add a Button control in the "List of products" tab pane:

		- On the "Creation" tab, in the "Usual controls" group, click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_Bouton_GAF.jpg)
.

		- Click below the "Modify " Button control in the window.

		- The control is automatically created.




3. Modify the characteristics of the control (select "Description" in the context menu): 

	- Name this control "BTN_InStock". 

	- Enter the caption "In stock?".

- We will test the Webservice:

	1. Test the project (click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_GO_Projet_WD_GAF.jpg)
 in the quick access buttons).

	2. Click the "List of products" tab if necessary.

	3. Select any product in the Table control and click "In stock?".  
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P4_Consommation%20WS%20-%20HC%20N%B0006.jpg&type=thumb)


	4. Validate the information window and close the application.
