## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000133"></a>
Your application is complete. We have already seen how to make sure the application works properly using the following features:  

- the debugger, to understand operating errors ([Lesson 2.7. Debugger](../TutoWD/1410087580.md)),

- automated tests, to avoid regressions ([Lesson 4.12. Monitor changes in your applications](../TutoWD/1410087527.md)). 




You want to deploy this application to end-user computers.

Why not use the WINDEV tools to optimize your application? WINDEV offers a set of tools and features to easily optimize your application and avoid predictable bugs. 

This part presents these tools and their use.

We have prepared a project to help you better understand and use these tools!
