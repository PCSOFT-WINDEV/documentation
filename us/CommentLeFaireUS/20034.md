A combination is a type of variabble containing a list of values. This type of variable is used to normalize the possible values of a parameter. For example, the developer will be able to initialize this parameter from the possible values imposed by the combination. 

The variable associated with this combination can take several list values by adding them.

For more details, see [Combination (Type of variable)](../Motscles/1514074.md).

## Declaration and use
<a name="declaration_and_use_ELTTEXTE000120"></a>


### Syntaxes
<a name="syntaxes_ELTPARAGRAPHE000023"></a>

The following syntax is used to declare a combination: 


```txt
CombinationName is Combination 
	Possible value 1
	Possible value 2
	Possible value 3
	...
END
```


To use a combination that was declared beforehand, use the following syntax: 


```txt
VariableName is CombinationName 

VariableName = Possible value 1 + Possible value 3
```



### Example
<a name="example_ELTPARAGRAPHE000034"></a>


```wl
PossibleMode is Combination 
	Bold
	Italic
	Underlined
END

ParamMode is PossibleMode 

ParamMode = Bold + Underlined
```



### WLanguage functions

The following functions are used to handle a combination through programming: 

- [CombinationFromName](../WDLang1/1000020771.md).

- [CombinationFromValue](../WDLang1/1000020770.md).
