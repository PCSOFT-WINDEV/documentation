## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000146"></a>
To perform a **TOP 10** query with the best 10 records from a data file, you can create a loop and set a condition to break out of the loop after 10 iterations. 

The best method to perform this **TOP 10** query consists in using an SQL query.

Let's see how to perform a **TOP 10** query by using: 

- [an SQL query created with the query editor](#NOTE2_1).

- [a query created through programming](#NOTE3_1). 




This method can be applied to a TOP 3 query or to any other **TOP** query corresponding to a selection of the first or last N results.

## SQL TOP 10 query in the query editor
<a name="sql_top_10_query_the_query_editor_ELTTEXTE000170"></a>
This query is used to perform a **TOP 10**, which means the best 10 results from a selection of records coming from a data file. 

In this example, we are going to perform the **TOP 10** for the best 10 orders.

The steps for creating this SQL query with filter are as follows: 

1. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_nouveau.gif)
 in the quick access buttons. 

	- In the window that is displayed, click "Queries". 

	- The query creation wizard starts.




2. Specify that you want to create a select query ("Select" option).

	Go to the next step of the wizard.

3. The query description window appears.

4. Give a name and a caption to the query:

5. In the left section of the description window, choose the file items that will be used (in our example, the ORDER file and the OrderNum and TotalIOT items). 

6. Double-click the names of the items to add them to the list of query items: 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CLF_Requ%EAte_TOP10%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.gif)


7. A **TOP** is based on a sort. In the example, we are going to sort the orders on the TotalIOT item in descending order. To apply a sort, click "Sort" in the right section of the editor.
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CLF_Requ%EAte_TOP10%20-%20HC%20N%B0004.gif)


8. Select "Sort by the selected item" from the menu that is displayed. 

9. In the window that appears: 

	- Select the sort order ("Descending" in our example). 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CLF_Requ%EAte_TOP10%20-%20HC%20N%B0005.gif)


	- Validate. 

10. To create a **TOP** query, click "The first n..." in the right section of the editor.
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CLF_Requ%EAte_TOP10%20-%20HC%20N%B0003%201.gif)


11. In the window that appears: 

	- Select the option "Select the first records (TOP)".

	- Specify the number of records to select (in our example, 10 for a **TOP 10**). 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CLF_Requ%EAte_TOP10%20-%20HC%20N%B0006.gif)





12. Validate the window. 

13. Validate the query description window. The query is displayed in the editor: 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CLF_Requ%EAte_TOP10%20-%20HC%20N%B0007.gif)


14. Save the query (Ctrl + S). 

15. Press F2 to see the SQL code:

16. Run the query test (GO in the quick access buttons). 

17. The query can be run in the program by [HExecuteQuery](../WDLang4/3044080.md).

## SQL query with "TOP n" through programming
<a name="sql_query_with_top_through_programming_ELTTEXTE000194"></a>
The SQL queries can be directly written through programming in the WLanguage code. To do so, you must: 

1. Create a variable of type [Data source](../WDLang4/1514053.md) to represent the query at runtime. 

2. Create a Character String variable to contain the SQL code of the query and write the SQL code in this variable. 

3. Run the SQL query with [HExecuteSQLQuery](../WDLang4/3044084.md).

4. Browse the result with the HReadXXX functions.




Code example


```wl
Src1 is Data Source
sSQLCode is string

// Select the best 5 customers according to the sum of orders ...
sSQLCode = [
SELECT TOP 5 
	CUSTOMER.CustomerNum AS CustomerNum,
	CUSTOMER.CustomerName AS CustomerName,
	CUSTOMER.City AS City,
	SUM(ORDERS.TotalIOT) AS the_sum_TotalIOT
FROM 
	CUSTOMER,	
	ORDERS
WHERE 
	CUSTOMER.CustomerNum = ORDERS.CustomerNum

GROUP BY 
	CUSTOMER.CustomerNum,
	CUSTOMER.CustomerName,
	CUSTOMER.City
ORDER BY 
	the_sum_TotalIOT DESC
]

HExecuteSQLQuery(Src1, hQueryDefault, sSQLCode)
FOR EACH Src1
	TRACE(Src1.CustomerNum, Src1.CustomerName, Src1.City)
END
```
