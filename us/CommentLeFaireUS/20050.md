<a name="NOTE1"></a>

A TreeView control is used to represent data hierarchically (on several levels). For example, a TreeView control can represent products groupd by Family then Sub-family.

To populate a TreeView control programmatically, you must use:

- [the TreeAdd function to add an element at any position](#NOTE2_1). 

- [the TreeInsert function to insert an element at a specific position](#NOTE3_1).

## TreeAdd function: Adding an element at any position
<a name="treeadd_function_adding_element_any_position_ELTTEXTE000151"></a>
[TreeAdd](../WDLang1/3018012.md) is used to add an element into a TreeView control. An element is made of:

- Root: represents the first level of the element

- Branch(es): represents the intermediate level(s)

- Leaf: represents the data to classify




An element is represented in the following format: 


```txt
Root + TAB + Branch 1 + TAB + Branch 2 + TAB + ... + TAB + Leaf
```


The syntax of [TreeAdd](../WDLang1/3018012.md) is as follows: 


```txt
TreeAdd(<TreeView name>, <Element>, <Collapsed image>, <Expanded image>, <Identifier>)
```


For more details, see the help page on the [TreeAdd](../WDLang1/3018012.md) function.


### Code samples

- Fill through programming: 
	
	```wl
	TreeAdd(TREE_City, "France")
	TreeAdd(TREE_City, "Italy")
	TreeAdd(TREE_City, "France" + TAB + "Paris")
	TreeAdd(TREE_City, "France" + TAB + "Marseille")
	TreeAdd(TREE_City, "France" + TAB + "Lyon")
	TreeAdd(TREE_City, "France" + TAB + "Montpellier")
	TreeAdd(TREE_City, "Italy" + TAB + "Rome")
	TreeAdd(TREE_City, "Italy" + TAB + "Pisa")
	TreeAdd(TREE_City, "Italy" + TAB + "Milan")
	TreeAdd(TREE_City, "Spain" + TAB + "Barcelona")
	TreeAdd(TREE_City, "Spain" + TAB + "Madrid")
	TreeAdd(TREE_City, "Spain" + TAB + "Valence")
	```


- Fill from a data file: 
	
	```wl
	// Read families
	FOR EACH Family
		// Add the family into the treeview (level 1: root) 
		TreeAdd(TREE_Products, Family.Caption)
		
		// Read sub-families
		FOR EACH SubFam with FamilyID = Family.FamilyID
			// Add the sub-family (level 2: branch 1) 
			TreeAdd(TREE_Products, Family.Caption + TAB + SubFam.Caption)
		
			// Read products
			FOR EACH PRODUCT with SubsFamID = SubFam.SubFamID
				// Add the product: (leaf)
				TreeAdd(TREE_Products, 
					Family.Caption + TAB + SubFam.Caption + TAB + PRODUCT.ProdCap)
			END
		END
	END
	```

## TreeInsert function: Inserting an element at a specific position
<a name="treeinsert_function_inserting_element_specific_position_ELTTEXTE000181"></a>
[TreeInsert](../WDLang1/3018023.md) is used to insert a leaf in relation to another leaf (brother leaf).

The syntax of [TreeInsert](../WDLang1/3018023.md) is as follows: 


```txt
TreeInsert(<TreeView name>, <Brother leaf>, <New leaf>, 
	<Collapsed image>, <Expanded image>, <Identifier>)
```
For more details, see the help page on the [TreeInsert](../WDLang1/3018023.md) function.


### Code example

```wl
TreeAdd(TREE_City, "France")
TreeAdd(TREE_City, "Italy")
TreeAdd(TREE_City, "France" + TAB + "Paris")
TreeAdd(TREE_City, "France" + TAB + "Marseille")
TreeAdd(TREE_City, "France" + TAB + "Lyon")

// Inserts the cities of Montpellier and Bordeaux on the same level as Lyon
TreeInsert(TREE_City, "France" + TAB + "Lyon", "Montpellier")
TreeInsert(TREE_City, "France" + TAB + "Lyon", "Bordeaux")
```
