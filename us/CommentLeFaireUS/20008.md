<a name="NOTE1"></a>

The caret is not always easy to identify in a window: sometimes, we may not not even know the control where the input is performed.

**How to highlight the control where the input is performed?**

Two methods are available: 

- [Using WLanguage events associated with the control](#NOTE2_1).

- [Using the Event function](#NOTE3_1).




<a name="NOTE2"></a>
<a name="NOTE2_1"></a>


## Method 1: Using WLanguage events associated with the control
<a name="method_1_using_wlanguage_events_associated_with_the_control_ELTTEXTE000142"></a>


- In the entry code of control, change the background color and/or the color of characters with [BackgroundColor](../Proprietes/2510022.md) and [Color](../Proprietes/2510071.md). 

- In the exit code of the control, use the default style color for the background color and/or color of characters with  [BackgroundColor](../Proprietes/2510022.md) and [Color](../Proprietes/2510071.md) with the **DefaultColor** constant.




Example: 


```wl
// -- Entry in the control
MySelf.BackgroundColor = DarkBlue
MySelf.Color = White
```



```wl
// Loss of focus
MySelf.BackgroundColor = DefaultColor
MySelf.Color = DefaultColor
```


Drawback: This operation must be performed "manually" on each control. This method is convenient if a small number of controls must be modified.

## Method 2: Using the Event function
<a name="method_2_using_the_event_function_ELTTEXTE000166"></a>
[Event](../WDLang1/3015011.md) is used to intercept the Taking Focus and Losing Focus events in the project or in each window to process.

Each one of the events must be associated with a WLanguage procedure in order to change the color or to restore the initial color.

Example: 

- Code to enter in the "Initializing" event of the project: 
	
	```wl
	Event(ProcColor, "*.*", 7) // 7 = WM_SETFOCUS
	Event(ProcUncolor, "*.*", 8) // 8 = WM_KILLFOCUS
	```





- Global WLanguage procedure called by the Event function (gain of focus): 
	
	```wl
	PROCEDURE ProcColor
	{_eve.name, indControl}..BackgroundColor = DarkBlue
	{_eve.name, indControl}..Color = White
	```





- Global WLanguage procedure called by the Event function (loss of focus): 
	
	```wl
	PROCEDURE ProcUncolor
	{_eve.name, indControl}..BackgroundColor = DefaultColor
	{_eve.name, indControl}..Color = DefaultColor
	```
