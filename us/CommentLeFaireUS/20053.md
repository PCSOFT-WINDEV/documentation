<a name="NOTE1"></a>
<a name="NOTE1_1"></a>
When fillilng a TreeView control, an image is associated with each element. It is a small symbol representing an opened or closed folder. Indeed, each level and each element of the treeview can be:

- collapsed (image of closed folder by default). 

- expanded (image of opened folder by default). 


These images can be modified through programming.

Remark: The image proposed by default for the elements in a TreeView control can also be changed with the [CollapsedImage](../Proprietes/2513016.md) and [ExpandedImage](../Proprietes/2513015.md) properties. 

<a name="NOTE2"></a>
<a name="NOTE2_1"></a>


## Method
<a name="method_ELTTEXTE000115"></a>
To modify the images representing the **collapsed** or **expanded** element, the desired images must be specified in [TreeAdd](../WDLang1/3018012.md) and [TreeInsert](../WDLang1/3018023.md).

The syntax for [TreeAdd](../WDLang1/3018012.md) is as follows: 


```txt
TreeAdd(<TreeView name>, <Element>, <Name of collapsed image>, <Name of expanded image>)
```


Code sample:


```wl
TreeAdd(TREE_Product, "Man", "M1.jpg", "M2.jpg")
TreeAdd(TREE_Product, "Woman", "W1.jpg", "W2.jpg")


TreeAdd(TREE_Product, "Man" + TAB + "Trousers", "trousers.JPG", "trousers.JPG")
TreeAdd(TREE_Product, "Man" + TAB + "Jacket", "jacket.JPG", "jacket.JPG")
TreeAdd(TREE_Product, "Man" + TAB + "Shoes", "shoesM.JPG", "shoesM.JPG")
TreeAdd(TREE_Product, "Woman" + TAB + "Dress", "dress.JPG", "dress.JPG")
TreeAdd(TREE_Product, "Woman" + TAB + "Pullover", "pullover.JPG", "pullover.JPG")
TreeAdd(TREE_Product, "Woman" + TAB + "Shoes", "shoesW.JPG", "shoesW.JPG")
```
