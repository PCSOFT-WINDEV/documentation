## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000117"></a>
WINDEV and WEBDEV 28 include a Native SQLite Connector. This Native Connector allows you to access an SQLite database from a WLanguage program without using an external driver.

SQLite is a system for managing indexed files. 

The Native Connector to SQLite is available: 

- in 32-bit and 64-bit Windows.

- in 32-bit and 64-bit Linux.

To use SQLite in native mode, you must program:

- with the "SQL" functions of WLanguage (see [Programming with SQL functions](../WDSQLite/1000019634.md)).

- with the "HFSQL" functions of WLanguage (see [Programming with HFSQL functions](../WDSQLite/1000019624.md)).




**Remarks**: 

- Don't forget to read the [limitations of the Native SQLite Connector](../WDSQLite/1000019635.md).

- To deploy sites that use the Native SQLite Connector, the latter must be installed on the server (WEBDEV Application Server).
