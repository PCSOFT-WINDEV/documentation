## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000303"></a>
The hosting parameters define **the default values** that will be used to create the new hosting accounts. These parameters can be modified at any time, when creating a user account.  

These parameters define:

- the different directories used by the WEBDEV sites,

- the Windows groups,

- the user accounts,

- the HFSQL Client/Server databases, 

- the WEBDEV engine details. 




If necessary, open the Hosting Control Center from the Windows Start menu.

## Directories
<a name="directories_ELTTEXTE000327"></a>
To configure the directories used by the server: 

1. In the "Hosting parameters" group, click "Directories".
	Remark: The different options of this group allow you to define the parameters that will be used by default for your hosting server. 

2. Choose the root directory in which the subdirectories of the WEBDEV user accounts will be created.
	|   |   |   |

| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png)<br> | Note | Use a directory local to the computer. If you want to use a network directory, a UNC path must necessarily be specified. The Internet guest of computer must have access to this path without having to authenticate. |





3. Specify:

	- the name of the subdirectory for **WEBDEV sites** (e.g., "Sites").

- the name of the subdirectory for **SOAP Webservices** (e.g., "SOAPWebservices").

- the name of the subdirectory for **REST Webservices** (e.g., "RESTWebservices").

- the name of the subdirectory for **WebSocket servers** (e.g., "WebSocketServers").

- the name of the **data** subdirectory for WEBDEV sites (e.g., HFSQL Classic data files).

- the name of the subdirectory for static sites (e.g., "www").

- the name of the setup data subdirectory.

## Windows groups
<a name="windows_groups_ELTTEXTE000369"></a>
Each hosting account is associated with two user accounts of the operating system:

- an account to install and manage the sites.

- an account to run the sites.




These two accounts do not have the same rights.

All administration accounts can be grouped into a group of users and all the runtime accounts can be grouped into another group.

You have the ability to specify the names of the groups to use.

**To define the groups**: 

1. In the "Hosting parameters" group, click "Windows groups".

2. Define which groups the Windows users created for the deployment will be assigned to. 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P6_Configuration%20CCH%E9bergement%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.jpg&type=thumb)


	- For the deployment, you can create a group or use the standard "Power Users" group.
			

- A good practice for running sites consists in using the "IIS_IUSRS" group (on Windows versions where it exists).

3. Click "Apply" to confirm. 




**Remark**: All the groups defined on the system are listed. You must create a group of users with the sufficient rights in order for this one to be displayed in the list.

### Access rights for using a site
<a name="access_rights_for_using_site_ELTPARAGRAPHE000081"></a>

Several access rights are required to operate the WEBDEV site. These rights affect the anonymous Internet user of the server (which means the Windows account that runs WD280AWP.EXE). The table below presents a summary of these rights.

| Directory | Rights |
| --- | --- |
| _WEB directory | Read |
| Data directory | Read/Write |
| Site directory | Read |
| WEBDEV directory | Read/Run |





| Registry | Rights |
| --- | --- |
| HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\PC Soft\\WebDev\\28.0 | Read |





| Executable | Runtime mode |
| --- | --- |
| WD280AWP.EXE | Execution in anonymous mode by using the Internet guest account |


<a name="NOTE3_3"></a>


### Access rights for performing a remote setup in anonymous mode
<a name="access_rights_for_performing_remote_setup_anonymous_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000135"></a>

Some additional access rights are required to remotely install and update an application in anonymous mode:

| Directory | Rights |
| --- | --- |
| _WEB directory | Read/Write |
| Base directory of the FTP account used for the installation | Read/Write |
| Data directory | Read/Write |
| Directory of WEBDEV accounts | Read/Write |
| Site directory | Read/Write |
| WEBDEV directory | Read/Run |





| Registry | Rights |
| --- | --- |
| HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\PC Soft\\WebDev\\28.0\\Applications | Read/Write |





| Executable | Runtime mode |
| --- | --- |
| WD280INSTAWP.EXE | Execution in authenticated mode by using the basic authentication. The execution rights must be granted to the Windows users performing the setup (rights identical to the FTP account). |


<a name="NOTE3_4"></a>


### Access rights for performing a remote setup in authenticated mode
<a name="access_rights_for_performing_remote_setup_authenticated_mode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000195"></a>

To install and update an application in authenticated mode, the access rights must be granted to a second account.

The account must be a Windows account with the same parameters as the FTP account used for remote setup (automatic if the FTP server is IIS). The rights to associate with this account are the same as the ones in the above table.

<a name="NOTE4"></a>
<a name="NOTE4_1"></a>


## Account limits
<a name="account_limits_ELTTEXTE000411"></a>
You can set two limits on a user account:

- the maximum number of connections assigned to the account. This number of connections must be distributed between the different WEBDEV sites of the account.  

- the number of sites associated with an account.




**To set the limits**: 

1. In the "Hosting parameters" group, click "Limits".

2. Specify: 

	- The maximum number of connections that will be shared between sites (0 = unlimited),

	- If the number of sites associated with an account must be limited, etc.

## HFSQL Client/Server database
<a name="hfsql_clientserver_database_ELTTEXTE000435"></a>
To define the characteristics of the HFSQL servers in Client/Server mode that can be associated with a user account: 

1. In the "Hosting parameters" group, click "HFSQL Client/Server database". The Hosting Control Center allows you to define the different HFSQL servers located on the server. When creating a user account, you will be able to select the HFSQL server the application data should be copied to. 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P6_Configuration%20CCH%E9bergement%20-%20HC%20N%B0004.jpg&type=thumb)


2. You can specify the following characteristics when creating an HFSQL server:

	- description, 

	- server IP address, 

	- connection port, 

	- the administrator username and password.







Remark: You have the ability to create or delete an HFSQL server.

Reminder: This information makes it easier to create user accounts (especially when creating many accounts). They are optional. The missing information can be entered when creating the account.

## Characteristics of the WEBDEV engine
<a name="characteristics_the_webdev_engine_ELTTEXTE000459"></a>
The Hosting Control Center allows you to quickly find the characteristics of the WEBDEV engine:

- Setup directory.

- File directory for user accounts.

- AWP module directory.

- Information about the engine version.




To access this information: 

1. Open the Hosting Control Center from the Windows Start menu.

2. In the "Hosting parameters" group, click "Information".
