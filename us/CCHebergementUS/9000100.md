<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000075"></a>
The Hosting Control Center allows easy hosting of WEBDEV 28 sites. This tool is mainly intended for hosting providers and Webmasters. The center manages the WEBDEV accounts as well as the account for the "IIS Web server" (versions 5.xx, 6.xx, 7.xx and 8.xx) and the rights for the Windows operating system.

The Hosting Control Center is installed on the deployment computer (CCHebergement.exe) and only works with Windows and an IIS server.

It is very easy to use. Simply: 

1. [Configure the specific characteristics of the server](../CCHebergement/9000101.md). This configuration will be used by default for all users. 

2. Create the [deployment accounts](../CCHebergement/9000102.md). This operation can be automated by using a [command line](../CCHebergement/9000204.md).
