<a name="creating_new_user_ELTTEXTE000142"></a>
To create a deployment account from the Hosting Control Center:

1. Open the Hosting Control Center from the Windows Start menu.

2. In the "Users" group, click "New user". The user creation wizard starts. Simply follow the different steps.
	Remark: If necessary, the Hosting Control Center will prompt you to define an administration group. In this example, answer "Yes" to the question "Continue without this group?". 

3. You can: 

	- Create a Windows account. This account will be used for deploying and configuring your sites. 

	- Use an existing Windows account. 




4. If you are creating a Windows account, enter the username and password (you can also generate the password. In that case, don't forget to write it down).

Go to the next step of the wizard.

 The (optional) options are: 

	- This account is a WEBDEV administrator account: In this case, this account will be able to configure the other user accounts via the remote administrator.

	- Leave account inactive when created: In this case, this account cannot be used to deploy or update sites. Likewise, this account won't allow you to use the remote administrator. 




6. Go to the next step.

7. The wizard suggests a Windows account to run the applications. Go to the next step of the wizard. 

8. Enter the user information. Go to the next step.

9. The directories of the user account are defined automatically according to the data specified in the server configuration.

10. Go to the next step.

11. Specify the maximum number of connections allowed for the account and, if necessary, the maximum number of sites that can be installed.

12. Select or specify the parameters of the HFSQL Client/Server server that must be associated with the user account.

13. The next step of the wizard includes virtual websites. 

	- If you choose to create a new virtual site, simply enter the DNS name that will point to this site (the DNS must also be configured).

	- If you choose to use an existing virtual site, its configuration will be replaced.
			Remark: the root directory of the virtual site will change. If sites (developed in WEBDEV or not) are already operating on this same virtual Web server, they may be impacted. You may have to restore the initial root directory (c:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\ by default).




14. Go to the next step.

15. In this step you can specify whether FTP access and deployment should be allowed for the user. This step is not necessary for HTTP deployments. 

16. Go to the next step.

17. The wizard is finished. Check all choices. You can uncheck the operations you don't want the wizard to perform for you.

18. Validate the wizard. Your server is now ready to host WEBDEV sites.
