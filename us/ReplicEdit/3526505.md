## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000100"></a>
A replication description created with ReplicEdit can be published from this tool on a replication server. 

This operation must be performed when replicating an Android or iOS application.

### Publishing a replication

To publish a replication: 

1. Select "Deployment .. Deploy the replication on a server". The wizard starts.

2. Select the server on which the replication will be deployed:

	- A dedicated replication server. 

- A replication server of PC SOFT Cloud. In this case, you must have a PC SOFT Cloud account. 

3. For a dedicated replication server, this server was installed beforehand. For more details, see [Replication server for the assisted universal replication](../WDLang4/1000017227.md). 

4. Specify: 

	- the server address (the IP address preferably), 

	- a login and a password, 

	- the name of the replication (name of WER file).

5. In the next step, specify the periodicity for preparing the data to replicate:

	- **Immediate preparation**: the data to replicate is prepared during a replication request. In this case, the replication will be used to get the most updated data. However, the preparation of the replica may be quite slow.

- **Periodic preparation**: the data to replicate is prepared on a regular basis, according to a specific periodicity. In this case, during the replication request, the last prepared data is automatically used. This solution is faster (the time for preparing the data to replicate is null) but the data may not be updated. 
			This solution is recommended for replicating a mobile application (Android or iOS). 

6. Validate. The wizard proposes the WLanguage code that must be included in the application to synchronize the data.
