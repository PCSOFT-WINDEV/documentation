### Add project to SCM
<a name="add_project_scm_ELTPARAGRAPHE000026"></a>

To use an existing project with the Source Code Manager, simply add it to the repository.

- We will add the "Full_WEBDEV_Site" project to the repository. 




- Open the project you worked on in the previous lesson. 

	1. Go to the WEBDEV home page (Ctrl + &lt;).

	2. On the home page, click "Tutorial", then in "Parts 11 and 12", double-click "Full WEBDEV Site - Exercise".

	3. A dialogue box prompts you to open the project you worked on in the previous lesson. You can open the local copy or the original project. Select "Open the local copy".

| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=exemple-WB.png) | Answers | A completed project is available. You can use this project to complete the different exercises of this lesson. To open the completed project, go to the home page and click "Tutorial", then in "Parts 11 and 12", double-click "Full WEBDEV Site - Answers". |











- To add the "Full_WEBDEV_Site" project to the repository:

	1. In the ribbon, on the "SCM" tab, in the "Add project" group, click "Add project to SCM". The wizard for adding projects to a repository opens: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P12_Int%E9gration%20dans%20le%20GDS%20WB%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.jpg&type=thumb)
The repository has not been created yet. We will create a repository in HFSQL Client/Server format.
			|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png) | Note | We will create a "Client/Server" repository on the server we installed in [part 11](../TutoWB/1410087211.md). Please read this part carefully if you haven't already! |





	2. Click "HFSQL Client/Server".
			|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png) | Note | If the repository is in HFSQL Client/Server format, it can be used remotely. |





	3. The HFSQL Client/Server repository creation window opens. 

	4. Specify the parameters of the HFSQL server installed previously:  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P12_Int%E9gration%20dans%20le%20GDS%20WB%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.jpg&type=thumb)


		- The server name and its port.

- The name and password of the administrator.

5. Validate the new repository (click "Create repository"). This operation can take quite a long time in Client/Server mode.

6. The repository has now been created. We will add our project to this repository.

7. Go to the next step. The current user is not allowed to access the HFSQL server. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P12_Int%E9gration%20dans%20le%20GDS%20WB%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.jpg&type=thumb)
We are going to create this user: enter the required information and click "Create account".

8. The wizard prompts you to save the project in the "Projects" subdirectory of the repository. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P12_Int%E9gration%20dans%20le%20GDS%20WB%20-%20HC%20N%B0004.jpg&type=thumb)
Accept this location. Go to the next step.

9. Select the project elements that will be added to the repository. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P12_Int%E9gration%20dans%20le%20GDS%20WB%20-%20HC%20N%B0005.jpg&type=thumb)
Add all project elements. Click "All" and go to the next step.

10. The wizard asks you to select the project dependencies that will be added to the repository. These dependencies correspond to all external elements required by the project (images, style sheets, etc.).
			Add all project dependencies. Go to the next step.

11. Validate the project integration in the SCM. The project and its elements have been added to the repository.

| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png) | Note | **Sharing project elements**<br><br>When the projects that share the same resources (analysis, windows, etc.) are integrated into the SCM, the relevant elements can be shared between the different projects. Therefore, the same element is checked in only once and the modifications are automatically applied to the other projects. |

### Opening a project from the SCM
<a name="opening_project_from_the_scm_ELTPARAGRAPHE000110"></a>

In our example, the project is checked into the SCM and can be used directly.

**In a real case, in order for other developers to work on a project located in the Source Code Manager, they must get a copy of this project locally.**

To do so, follow these steps:

1. Open the project from the Source Code Manager: on the "Home" tab, in the "General" group, expand "Open" and select "Open a project from the SCM".

2. In the "HFSQL C/S" tab, enter the repository location parameters and validate (this step is necessary only if the current project is not included in the SCM):  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P12_Int%E9gration%20dans%20le%20GDS%20WB%20-%20HC%20N%B0006.jpg&type=thumb)


3. In the window that appears, indicate the connection and local directory if necessary:  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P12_Int%E9gration%20dans%20le%20GDS%20WB%20-%20HC%20N%B0007.jpg&type=thumb)
**Remark**: If the project was already opened from the SCM, the SCM proposes to open the project as usual or to overwrite the content (to retrieve the entire project).


This operation must be performed only once by each developer who uses the project.
The developer who added the project to the Source Code Manager (you in this case) has no operations to perform.|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png) | Note | Next time, you will be able to open a project included in the SCM as any other project: simply open the project (".WWP" file) corresponding to the local copy. |

### Configuring the SCM
<a name="configuring_the_scm_ELTPARAGRAPHE000149"></a>

Before you start working on the elements of the project included in the SCM, you must configure the mode for checking out the project elements.

When working on the elements of a project in the SCM, the element must be checked out from the repository before it can be modified, then it must be checked back in once the changes have been made. Therefore, the modified element becomes available to all SCM users.

**WEBDEV features two modes to check out the project elements**:

- **standard mode**: if you open an element that has not been checked out from the SCM, a panel indicates that the element must be checked out to modify it. The element can be checked out immediately (check-out button found in the dialog box).

- **automatic mode**: if you try to modify an element that has not yet been checked out, the SCM automatically prompts you to check it out. Once the check-out is validated, the element can be modified.
	**Remark**: this mode is not recommended when using the SCM with a slow Internet connection.




**The automatic check-out will be used in this tutorial**.

- To make sure that the automatic check-out is enabled, on the "Home" tab, in the "Environment" group, expand "Options" and select "General options of WEBDEV". In the "General" tab, check (if necessary) "Check out elements on first modification".
