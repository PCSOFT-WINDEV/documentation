## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000519"></a>
When the WEBDEV site is developed, it must be deployed to a server in order to make it accessible to the users.

We are going to present the different steps required to deploy a WEBDEV site.|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png) | Note | This section presents the deployment on a Windows server. If you are using a Linux server, see the documentation about WEBDEV Application Server for Linux. |



Several methods can be used to deploy a WEBDEV site (in Session or AWP mode):

- Remote deployment from the development computer (via HTTP or FTP).

- Deployment to [PCSCloud](https://pcscloud.net/UK/cloud_development.awp) (PC SOFT's Cloud service).

- Remote deployment from a management computer (via HTTP or FTP) using a "deployment package".

- Deployment via PC SOFT test hosting service.

- Deployment via physical media (CD, etc.). This deployment can be stand-alone:  in this case, a web server and a limited WEBDEV Application Server are also installed by the setup.

- Deployment via a Docker image of the site.




<a name="NOTE3"></a>
<a name="NOTE3_1"></a>


## Required configuration
<a name="required_configuration_ELTTEXTE000561"></a>
To deploy to the server, the following elements must have been installed and configured:

- A web server,

- A WEBDEV Application Server (a 10-connection version is provided with WEBDEV).


Remark: For a remote installation via FTP, an FTP server must also be installed on the server.  

When installing WEBDEV, you can install the test version of the WEBDEV Application Server. This allows you to test the deployment of your dynamic WEBDEV sites (in Session or AWP mode).

To simplify the deployment operations and allow you to directly test the deployment of your website, we will:

- Install "WEBDEV Application Server - 10 connections" on a Windows computer. This application server must be installed on a computer other than the development computer. WEBDEV must not be installed on the same computer.

- Deploy the site remotely (via HTTP).

| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png) | Note | If you already have the parameters to access the server to which your site will be deployed, there is no need to install "WEBDEV Application Server - 10 connections". You can start the installation directly on the server via HTTP. |

## Installing and configuring "WEBDEV Application Server - 10 connections"
<a name="installing_and_configuring_webdev_application_server_10_connections_ELTTEXTE000603"></a>
The setup program of "WEBDEV Application Server - 10 connections" is available: 

- in the WEBDEV setup package (if you have chosen to download the WEBDEV Application Server setup). In this case, run "Menu.exe" and select "Install WEBDEV Application Server - 10 connections".

- on windev.com, on the [WEBDEV download page](https://windev.com/ts/download/index.html), "Download WEBDEV 28", then "WEBDEV 28 Application Server (Deployment)".

### Installing "WEBDEV Application Server - 10 connections"
<a name="installing_webdev_application_server_10_connections_ELTPARAGRAPHE000094"></a>

The installation steps are as follows:

1. Select the installation language of WEBDEV Application Server and confirm. 

2. Accept the license agreement. Go to the next step of the wizard.

3. Select "Install limited version (10 connections)". Go to the next step.
	

<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P6_Install%20Serveur%2010%20Connexions%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.jpg)


1. Select the installation path of the Application Server ("C:\\WEBDEV 28" by default).<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P6_Install%20Serveur%2010%20Connexions%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.jpg)


2. The next step allows you to specify the root directory for deploying sites and web services. Keep the default path and go to the next step. 

3. In the next step, you can define the advanced settings of WEBDEV Application Server. Keep the "Use default parameters" option.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P6_Install%20Serveur%2010%20Connexions%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.jpg)


4. **If it is the first time you install WEBDEV Application Server**, specify the parameters of the Windows account that will be used as WEBDEV administrator. This account will also be called "Hosting account". 
	You can create a new Windows account or use an existing Windows account. 
	Select an option and go to the next step. 

5. **If a previous version of WEBDEV Application Server has already been installed on the computer**, the wizard allows you to: 

	- manage the sites and web services from earlier versions. Keep the "Keep sites in their current versions" option and go to the next step.

	- import WEBDEV accounts. Keep the option "Don't import existing accounts" and go to the next step. Enter the login credentials of the Windows account that will be used as WEBDEV administrator. This account will also be called "Hosting account". 
			You can create a new Windows account or use an existing Windows account. 
			Select an option and go to the next step. 




6. The next step allows you to manage the hosting of SaaS sites. The SaaS activation automatically installs a site and a web service to manage your SaaS sites. For more details, see [SaaS](../WDLang3/9500213.md). Validate this step.

7. In the next step, you can specify that a secure connection is required to access all remote administration sites. 

8. The next step allows you to select the language of the application server that will be installed. The Application Server is available in 3 languages: english, spanish, french. 

9. Validate the different setup steps.

10. If the computer contains several virtual servers, select the web servers on which the WEBDEV Application Server must be installed. You can keep the default website. Validate.

11. The wizard presents different options: select the desired options and keep "Start the WEBDEV administrator". Validate.

| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png) | Note | The "View the user guide" option automatically displays the [WEBDEV Application Server](../WDAdminDeploiement/3539053.md) help at the end of the installation process. This help may help you solve configuration problems linked to access rights on the server. |





12. "WEBDEV Application Server - 10 connections" is automatically configured. WEBDEV sites can be deployed immediately. 

13. The WEBDEV administrator and the Hosting Control Center are automatically started. 



<a name="NOTE4_3"></a>


### Configuration via the Hosting Control Center
<a name="configuration_via_the_hosting_control_center_ELTPARAGRAPHE000196"></a>

When the "WEBDEV Application Server - 10 connections" is installed, a Windows account is created or defined as administrator of the WEBDEV Application Server. This user has all the rights (administration, deployment, statistics). 

You can use the Hosting Control Center to configure the different characteristics of this user or to define a specific user to deploy your sites. 

Reminder: The Hosting Control Center is a tool designed to automatically configure the following elements: 

- WEBDEV Application Server, 

- Web server (IIS),

- FTP server (IIS). The FTP server must be configured only for an installation via FTP. 




- If necessary, open the Hosting Control Center from the Windows Start menu.




**First, we will see the different parameters available in the Hosting Control Center**. 

- To view the different parameters: 

	1. Click "Directories" in the "Hosting parameters" group to configure the directories used by your server.
			Remark: The different options of this group allow you to define the parameters that will be used by default for your hosting server. 

	2. Indicate where the sites will be installed. Choose the root directory where the subdirectories of the WEBDEV accounts will be created.
			|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png) | Note | Use a local directory. If you use a network directory, you need to specify a UNC path. Guest users must be able to access this path without the need for authentication. |




			You can choose the names of the subdirectories that will contain the sites, web services and data.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P6_Configuration%20CCH%E9bergement%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.jpg&type=thumb)


	3. Click "Windows groups" and define the groups to which the Windows users created for the deployment will be assigned.
			For the deployment, you can create a group or use the standard "Power Users" group.
			A good practice for running sites consists in using the "IIS_IUSRS" group (on Windows versions where it is available).<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P6_Configuration%20CCH%E9bergement%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.jpg&type=thumb)
Click "Apply" to validate. 

4. Click "Limits" to specify the resource limitations to be applied to WEBDEV accounts:  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P6_Configuration%20CCH%E9bergement%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.jpg&type=thumb)



<a name="NOTE4_4"></a>


### Creating a deployment account
<a name="creating_deployment_account_ELTPARAGRAPHE000245"></a>

The Hosting Control Center can also be used to create a deployment account.

This account can be used to deploy WEBDEV sites from WEBDEV. 

To create a deployment account:

1. Click the "New user" button. The user creation wizard starts. Simply follow the different steps.
	Remark: If necessary, the Hosting Control Center will prompt you to define an administration group. In this example, answer "Yes" to the question "Continue without this group?". 

2. You can: 

	- Create a Windows account. This account will be used for deploying and configuring your sites. 

	- Use an existing Windows account. 


 In this example we will create a Windows account. Enter the username and password (you can also generate the password. In that case, don't forget to write it down).<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P6_Configuration%20CCH%E9bergement%20-%20HC%20N%B0005.jpg&type=thumb)
Go to the next step of the wizard.

3. The wizard presents the WEBDEV options associated with the account: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P6_Configuration%20CCH%E9bergement%20-%20HC%20N%B0006.jpg&type=thumb)
Keep the default options and go to the next step.

4. The wizard suggests a Windows account to run the applications. Keep the default options and go to the next step of the wizard. 

5. Enter the user information. Go to the next step.

6. The directories of the user account are automatically filled according to the specified data.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P6_Configuration%20CCH%E9bergement%20-%20HC%20N%B0008.jpg&type=thumb)


7. Continue with the wizard until you reach the "Virtual website" step.

	- If you choose to create a new virtual site, simply enter the DNS name that will point to this site (the DNS must also be configured).

	- If you choose to use an existing virtual site, its configuration will be replaced.




8. Go to the next step.

9. In this step you can specify whether FTP access and deployment should be allowed for the user. In our case, this option is not necessary because we will perform an HTTP deployment. Go to the next step.

10. The wizard is finished. Check all choices. You can uncheck the operations you don't want the wizard to perform for you.

11. Validate the wizard. Your server is now ready to host WEBDEV sites. We will use the user we created to test the deployment of a site via HTTP.

## The different deployment modes
<a name="the_different_deployment_modes_ELTTEXTE000735"></a>
Now that the web server is configured, we can deploy our site. Several methods are available. The choice of a method mainly depends on the technical constraints (ability to use an FTP server, access to the server, etc.). 
A dynamic WEBDEV site can be deployed according to one of these methods:

- **Remote deployment from the development computer** (via HTTP or FTP). We will deploy our site using this method via HTTP.
	Remark: deployment via FTP requires an FTP server. 

- **Deployment in PCSCloud**.

- **Remote deployment from a management computer** (via HTTP or FTP) using a "deployment package". This deployment mode is similar to the direct remote deployment. Main difference: the deployment is not performed from the WEBDEV development environment. In this mode:

	- the developer generates a deployment package.

	- the site administrator (who can be a person other than the developer) deploys the package on the remote server via WDDeploy. WDDeploy is a redistributable tool provided with WEBDEV.




- **Deployment via physical media** (CD, etc.). Deployment via physical media creates a setup support (like an application) that must be run directly on the server. This deployment mode is available in Windows only. 

- **Deployment via PC SOFT test hosting service**.

- **Deployment via a Docker image of the site**.




Let's see the deployment via HTTP.
<a name="NOTE5_2"></a>


### Detailed example: deployment via HTTP
<a name="detailed_example_deployment_via_http_ELTPARAGRAPHE000304"></a>

We will deploy the "Full_WEBDEV_Site" project we worked on in the previous parts of this tutorial. A completed version is available if you haven't worked on this project.



- Open the project you worked on in the previous lesson. 

	1. Go to the WEBDEV home page (Ctrl + &lt;).

	2. On the home page, click "Tutorial", then in "Parts 3 to 6", double-click "Full WEBDEV Site - Exercise".

	3. A dialogue box prompts you to open the project you worked on in the previous lesson. You can open the local copy or the original project. Select "Open the local copy". 





|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=exemple-WB.png) | Answers | A completed project is available. You can use this project to complete the different exercises of this lesson. To open the completed project, go to the home page and click "Tutorial", then in "Parts 3 to 6", double-click "Full WEBDEV Site - Answers". |







**Preparing the setup**

WEBDEV includes a setup wizard that allows you to easily deploy your site to a WEBDEV hosting provider (Internet or Extranet site, for example) or to one of your servers dedicated to WEBDEV hosting (Intranet site, for example).

- We are going to use this wizard:

	1. In the ribbon, on the "Project" tab, in the "Generation" group, expand "Deploy site" and select "Generate and deploy site".<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P6_D%E9ploiement%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.jpg&type=thumb)


	2. The wizard starts. Before starting the installation, you need to include all the elements of your site in a library. A library is a file that contains all the elements created during the development steps (database description, pages, reports, queries, etc.). HTML pages and images are not included in the library.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P6_D%E9ploiement%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.jpg&type=thumb)
Go to the next step.

3. You can include multiple languages in the library. In our example, we will keep the default options. Go to the next step.

4. In "Library version details", you can define the information that will appear in the file properties in the Windows explorer. Go to the next step.

5. Don't make a backup copy of the project and confirm.




**Installation**

- The setup wizard will now ask you some questions to define how your site will be deployed. In our case, we are going to perform a remote installation via HTTP:

	1. Select "Deploy to a remote WEBDEV Application Server".<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P6_D%E9ploiement%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.jpg&type=thumb)
Go to the next step.

	2. To define the server parameters, you will need to get the information below from your hosting provider. We will enter the information corresponding to the previous setup:

		- Server address (in our example, name of the computer where "WEBDEV Application Server - 10 connections" was installed). The name can be:

			- a computer name accessible over the network (for example: "TestServer"), 

			- an IP address (for example: 192.168.15.99),

			- an Internet address (for example: www.myserver.com).<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P6_D%E9ploiement%20-%20HC%20N%B0004.jpg&type=thumb)




3. Once you have entered your account details, go to the next step.

4. Enter the site deployment parameters. Keep the default options.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P6_D%E9ploiement%20-%20HC%20N%B0005.jpg&type=thumb)
Go to the next step.

5. The wizard prompts you to select the deployment mode: 

	- Deploy without disconnecting users. This option allows you to update the site without disconnecting the users. 

	- Deploy by disconnecting users. If this option is selected, the users will be automatically disconnected to update the site. 


During the file transfer, the wizard compresses and encrypts the transferred data. Your data is transferred with a high-security level.

At the end of the setup, a link allows you to immediately start the site.

<a name="NOTE6"></a>
<a name="NOTE6_1"></a>


## Directories on the development computer and the deployment server
<a name="directories_the_development_computer_and_the_deployment_server_ELTTEXTE000801"></a>
The site files are stored on different directories in the development computer and the deployment server. The following table presents the default directories defined by WEBDEV.


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| Directory on the development computer | Directory on the deployment server |
| &lt;Project name&gt;\\&lt;Project name&gt;_WEB | &lt;site&gt;\\&lt;site name&gt;\\&lt;site name in uppercase&gt;_WEB |
| &lt;Project name&gt;\\Exe | For a site:<br><br>- data files (.fic, .ndx, .mmo, .ftx): &lt;data&gt;\\&lt;site name&gt;<br><br>- other files: &lt;site&gt;\\&lt;site name&gt;<br><br><br>For a web service: <br><br>- data files (.fic, .ndx, .mmo, .ftx): &lt;data&gt;\\&lt;site name&gt;<br><br>- other files: &lt;web service&gt;\\&lt;site name&gt;<br><br><br> |


where: 

- &lt;site&gt;, &lt;data&gt; and &lt;web service&gt; are the directories defined when creating the hosting account (see above).

- &lt;site name&gt; is the name of the site. 


The directories of the files can be defined in the deployment wizard.
