## Overview of the site created and handled in parts 3, 4 and 5
<a name="overview_the_site_created_and_handled_parts_3_4_and_5_ELTTEXTE000191"></a>
Parts 3, 4 and 5 of this tutorial will allow you to create an order management site that uses data files in HFSQL Classic format.

In part 3 "Intranet site with data", we will develop the Intranet part of the site. This Intranet site will be used to view, enter and modify products. **This site is a dynamic WEBDEV site in Session mode**.|   |   |   |

SEO"](../TutoWB/1410087499.md). |





Part 4 "Internet site with data" will allow you to create the Internet part of the site. You will be able to list the new products and view their details.

Part 5 "Let's develop" will allow you to continue the site development, by exploring the following features:

- Printing reports,

- Managing use levels,

- Sending emails,

- Managing multiple languages,

- ...


The development of this site will also allow us to cover the deployment phase in part 6. You will see the main points for developing a WEBDEV project.

In the previous part of this tutorial we saw how to create a project and an analysis. We won't go back to it. We will work with a project that already contains an analysis with data. The site analysis is a more complete version of the analysis we created previously.

To create this site, you can follow all the steps from the lessons using a training project, or open a completed project. If you don't want to perform all the operations, you can open the corrected project directly.

## How to display a WEBDEV site in Session mode
<a name="how_display_webdev_site_session_mode_ELTTEXTE000233"></a>
In part 3, we will develop the Intranet part of the site. This part of the site uses a WEBDEV site in Session mode. 

The following image presents how a WEBDEV site in Session mode is displayed:<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=PageAffiche_Ctx.gif)



### WEBDEV session
<a name="webdev_session_ELTPARAGRAPHE000071"></a>

When the user connects to a WEBDEV site in Session mode, a session is automatically created on the server.

This session contains the page contexts corresponding to each page opened by the user.

The session ends when the user exits the browser or when the session timeout is exceeded. This timeout is defined in the WEBDEV administrator ("Configuration" tab, "Disconnect idle users after" option).
<a name="NOTE3_2"></a>


### Page contexts
<a name="page_contexts_ELTPARAGRAPHE000082"></a>

A page context is automatically created on the server each time a page is displayed in the browser. This page context contains all the elements required to build the page viewed by the end user:

- global variables,

- local variables,

- server processes and events,

- database connections,

- contexts of data files, etc.




The page contexts remain in memory on the server until the end of the WEBDEV session.

When the same page is called several times:

- If [PageDisplay](../WDLang2/3058008.md) is called to display the page, the page context is deleted and created again.

- If [PageRefresh](../WDLang2/3058011.md) is called to display the page, the same page context is used again.

### Programming
<a name="programming_ELTPARAGRAPHE000108"></a>

The WEBDEV session and the page contexts are automatically managed by default. No programming is required.
