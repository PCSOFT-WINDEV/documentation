## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000425"></a>
In WEBDEV, you can use two types of anchors: 

- Anchor to content: The anchor to content option defines how a control or area reacts when its content is modified. Will the control keep the same size? Will it adapt to its content? 

- Anchor to browser: The anchor to browser option defines how a control or area reacts when the browser is resized. Will the control be enlarged? Will it move?
	This type of anchor defines how pages behave when displayed on specific resolutions (tablets, phones, etc.). 




Anchors can be easily implemented via an option in the context menu of the controls.

We will see how to use anchors with an example. In this lesson, we will only see how to anchor controls to the browser. 

We will create a project and a page to anchor controls to the browser and understand its advantages.

Later, we will edit this project to make it mobile-friendly using layouts.



- To create a project in WEBDEV:

	1. Start WEBDEV. 

	2. Go to the WEBDEV home page if necessary (Ctrl + &lt;). 

	3. On the home page, click "Create a project" and select "Site". The project creation wizard starts. 

	4. Keep the default options of the different steps of the project creation wizard, until you reach "Description - General information". 

	5. Enter the name of the project "Anchors" and click "Finish".

## Creating a page in zoning mode
<a name="creating_page_zoning_mode_ELTTEXTE000467"></a>


- To create a page to implement anchors:

	1. Create a new blank page.

		- In the "New" window, click "Page" then "Page".
						Remark: To open the element creation window, click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_Cr%E9er_WB_GAF.jpg)
 in the quick access buttons.

		- The page creation wizard starts.

		- Click "Blank" and validate the wizard.




2. The page save window appears.

3. Enter "Anchors" as title. The name is automatically filled in: "PAGE_Anchors".

4. Validate.




We will divide the page into 3 areas:

- A header (at the top, using all horizontal space available).

- A menu on the left (using all vertical space available).

- A content area in the center.


Each area will have a specific behavior when resizing the page.

To create the areas, we will use the zoning feature.

- To create a first title area at the top of the page:

	1. On the "Page" tab, in the "Edit" group, expand "Zoning" and select "Divide horizontally".

	2. The mouse cursor turns into a pen.

	3. Click at the top of the page and draw a horizontal line. The area is created when releasing the mouse button.  
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P7_Ancrages%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.jpg&type=thumb)








- To view this area, we will apply a background color:

	1. Open the area description window: select "Area description" in the context menu.

	2. In the "Style" tab, select the "Border/Bckgrd" element if necessary and select a background color (yellow, for example).

	3. Validate the area description window.  
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P7_Ancrages%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.jpg&type=thumb)








- We will follow the same steps to split the bottom area of the page:

	1. On the "Page" tab, in the "Edit" group, expand "Zoning" and select "Divide vertically".

	2. The mouse cursor turns into a pen.

	3. Click the center of the bottom area and draw a vertical line.







- To better view the areas, apply a green color to the area on the left and orange to the center area.




- We will create Static controls in each area:

	1. On the "Creation" tab, in the "Usual controls" group, expand "Text" and select "Simple static".

	2. Click inside the yellow area. The Static control is automatically created.

	3. Change the text (press the Spacebar): enter "Header".

	4. Repeat the steps above to create:

		- a Static control displaying "Menu" in the green area.

		- a Static control displaying "Content" in the orange area.







- Save (Ctrl + S) and test the page (click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_Go_Page_WB_GAF.jpg)
 in the quick access buttons).

	1. The page is displayed in the browser.  
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P7_Ancrages%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.jpg&type=thumb)


	2. Resize the browser: the page remains centered but the areas are not resized. 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P7_Ancrages%20-%20HC%20N%B0004.jpg&type=thumb)
We will change this behavior so that the page and the areas adapt to the size of the browser. To do so, we will use anchors.




- Close the browser.

## Implementing anchors
<a name="implementing_anchors_ELTTEXTE000491"></a>
We will set the anchors of the page, the anchors of the areas, and then the anchors of the controls.

When the browser is enlarged:

- The page should be enlarged vertically and horizontally. 

- The header area (yellow) should be enlarged horizontally.

- The menu area (green) should be enlarged vertically.

- The content area (orange) should be enlarged horizontally and vertically.

- The controls must remain centered in relation to their area.


Now, we will perform all the necessary operations.



- To set the page's anchoring options:

	1. Click the area of the editor outside the page. 

	2. Open the context menu and select "Anchor". The anchoring options window appears. 

	3. The page should be enlarged horizontally and vertically. Select: 

		- Position: Keep the default option (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P7_Ancrages%20-%20HC%20N%B0005%201.jpg)
).

		- Horizontal anchors: Enlarge or reduce like the browser (or its container).

		- Vertical anchors: Enlarge or reduce like the browser (or its container).




4. Validate.




- To anchor the areas:

	1. Select the yellow area.

	2. Open the context menu and select "Anchor". The anchoring options window appears. 

	3. The area must be enlarged horizontally. Select: 

		- Position: The control keeps its position.

		- Horizontal anchors: Enlarge or reduce like the browser (or its container).

		- Vertical anchors: Fixed height.
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P7_Ancrages%20-%20HC%20N%B0005.jpg&type=thumb)







- To set anchors of the controls:

	1. Select "Header".

	2. Open the context menu and select "Anchor".

	3. The control must be centered horizontally: 

		- Position: Horizontally centered.

		- Horizontal anchors: Fixed width.

		- Vertical anchors: Fixed height.




4. Validate. 

5. Repeat the same operations for the "Menu" and "Content" controls:

	- "Menu" must be vertically centered (select "Vertically centered"). 

	- "Content" must be centered (select "Centered"). 




- Save (Ctrl + S) and test the page (click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_Go_Page_WB_GAF.jpg)
 in the quick access buttons).

	1. The page is displayed in the browser.  
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P7_Ancrages%20-%20HC%20N%B0008.jpg&type=thumb)


	2. Resize the browser: the areas adapt to the available space in the browser.  
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P7_Ancrages%20-%20HC%20N%B0009.jpg&type=thumb)




- Close the browser.

## Implementing layouts
<a name="implementing_layouts_ELTTEXTE000515"></a>
Areas and anchors allow you to handle "small" changes in size. As explained previously, sites must be designed to be mobile-friendly. 
To correctly display sites on mobile devices, you need more than simple anchors. In some cases, some controls or entire areas must disappear to obtain a clean interface on these devices. 
This can be achieved using layouts. |   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png)<br> | Note | Layouts allow you to define multiple views of a single page in a project. This allows you to define:<br><br>- a specific view for mobile devices,<br><br>- a specific view for printing,<br><br>- a specific view to use the page in a WINDEV application. <br><br>- a specific view to use the page in a WINDEV Mobile application. <br><br>- ...<br><br><br> |



We will edit the page to obtain a specific layout for mobile devices. This layout will hide the green area. We will then test the site directly on a mobile device. 
|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png)<br> | Note | This lesson presents a quick overview of layouts in WEBDEV sites. The implementation and management of layouts in WEBDEV sites are explained in detail in the different lessons of [part 8](../TutoWB/1410087416.md). |










- To create a new layout:

	1. On the "Page" tab, in the "Layouts" group, expand "Layouts" and select "Add a layout from active view".  
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P7_Ancrage%20-%20Agencement%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.jpg&type=thumb)


	2. In the window that appears, a layout adapted to phones and tablets is shown. 
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P7_Ancrage%20-%20Agencement%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.jpg&type=thumb)
Confirm. 

3. Two layouts have been created in our example. These layouts appear as thumbnails, to the right of the "PAGE_Anchors" page.  
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P7_Ancrage%20-%20Agencement%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.jpg&type=thumb)




- Open the "Mobile" layout: 

	1. Double-click the Mobile layout thumbnail: the page corresponding to this layout is displayed in the center of the editor. 

	2. The ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P7_Ancrage%20-%20Agencement%20-%20HC%20N%B0004.jpg)
 option (upper-right corner of the main window, in the title bar) indicates if the "Automatic dissociation" mode is enabled. If this mode is enabled, the changes made in one of the pages in the layout will not be applied to the others. Keep the "Automatic disassociation" mode enabled.







- We will change the visibility of the controls in the Mobile layout. In mobile mode, the menu area on the left and its text can be removed to use a drop-down menu instead, for example (we will see how to implement this menu in a future lesson). For an easier experience, we will make these changes in the "Desktop" layout. 

	1. Double-click the "Desktop" thumbnail. 

	2. Select the green area. 

	3. In the context menu of the control, select "Layouts", go to "Visibility by layout" and deselect "Mobile (Smartphone)".  
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P7_Ancrage%20-%20Agencement%20-%20HC%20N%B0007.jpg&type=thumb)


	4. The thumbnail of the mobile layout is automatically updated. ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P7_Ancrage%20-%20Agencement%20-%20HC%20N%B0008.jpg)
If you open the mobile layout, the green area and its text are no longer shown. 






- Save (Ctrl + S) and test the page (click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_Go_Page_WB_GAF.jpg)
 in the quick access buttons).

	1. The page is displayed in the browser.  
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P7_Ancrage%20-%20Agencement%20bis%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.jpg&type=thumb)


	2. Resize the browser: the mobile layout is displayed.  
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P7_Ancrage%20-%20Agencement%20bis%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.jpg&type=thumb)




- Close the browser.




- Now, we can test the site on a phone or a tablet: 

	1. Expand the ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_Go_Page_WB_GAF.jpg)
 option in the quick access area and select "Test from a phone (access via a QR Code)".  
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P7_Ancrage%20-%20Agencement%20bis%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.jpg)


	2. A window appears and shows a QR code that you can scan with your mobile device.  ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P7_Ancrage%20-%20Agencement%20-%20HC%20N%B0009.jpg)
