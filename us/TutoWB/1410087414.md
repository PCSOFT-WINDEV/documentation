## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000648"></a>
To create a site with a database, you must:

- Create the site project. This project will contain all the elements of the website (pages, code, queries, reports, etc.). 

- Create the analysis linked to the project. The analysis allows you to define all the data files handled by the site.




<a name="NOTE3"></a>
<a name="NOTE3_1"></a>


## Creating the project
<a name="creating_the_project_ELTTEXTE000672"></a>


- To create the project:

	1. Start WEBDEV. 

	2. Go to the WEBDEV home page if necessary (Ctrl + &lt;). 

	3. In the home page, click "Create a project" and select "Site". The project creation wizard starts. The different steps of the wizard will help you create your project. The information specified in this wizard can be modified later.
			|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png) | Note | Tip: To create a project, you can also:<br><br>		1. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_Cr%E9er_WB_GAF.jpg) in the quick access buttons of the WEBDEV menu.<br><br>		2. The new element window appears: click "Project".<br><br><br> |





	4. The wizard proposes to create a blank project or a project based on an example. Select "Create a blank project" and go to the next step.  

	5. Specify the type of site to create. Select "WEBDEV site" and go to the next step. 

	6. The wizard includes two generation modes. Select "Session mode" and go the next step. 

	7. The wizard prompts you to enter the name, location and description of the project. In our case, this project will be named "My_WEBDEV_Site".<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2_Ma%20Premi%E8re%20Base%20-%201%20-%20Cr%E9ation%20Projet%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.jpg&type=thumb)


	8. By default, WEBDEV creates this project in the ".\\My Projects\\My_WEBDEV_Site" directory. You can keep this location or change it via the [...] button.
			|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png) | Note | When you develop for the Web, avoid using accented characters in the names of elements (projects, pages, etc.). |





9. The different steps of the wizard appear on the left. You can easily navigate between sections by clicking on them. Since the other steps of the "Description" are not strictly necessary, you can click "Guidelines" directly.

10. This section allows you to define the different guidelines of the project. For the code style, don't change the suggested options. Go to the next step.

11. This step allows you to define the style book (also called "Skin"). The style book defines the style of the website.
			|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png) | Note | Skins are used to standardize the visual aspect of a site and easily change styles.<br><br>Skin also include images, fonts, textures, button shapes and styles for the project. |



Select "Phoenix".<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2_Ma%20Premi%E8re%20Base%20-%201%20-%20Cr%E9ation%20Projet%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.jpg&type=thumb)

<a name="NOTE4_1"></a>


## Creating the analysis
<a name="creating_the_analysis_ELTTEXTE000768"></a>


- The steps of the analysis creation wizard are as follows:

	1. Specify the analysis name and directory. By default, the analysis name corresponds to the project name and the analysis directory is a ".ana" directory in the project directory. Keep the default parameters. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2_Ma%20Premi%E8re%20Base%20-%201%20-%20Cr%E9ation%20Projet%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.jpg&type=thumb)
Go to the next step of the wizard. 

	2. You can then choose the type of database used by the project. Select "HFSQL Classic". <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2_Ma%20Premi%E8re%20Base%20-%201%20-%20Cr%E9ation%20Projet%20-%20HC%20N%B0004.jpg&type=thumb)
Go to the next step of the wizard.

	3. Validate. The data file creation wizard starts automatically.

## Creating the description of data files
<a name="creating_the_description_data_files_ELTTEXTE000792"></a>
Our customer and order management application will be associated with the following analysis. This analysis includes five different data files (tables):

- Customer,

- Order,

- PaymentMode,

- OrderLine,

- Product.

<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2_Ma%20Premi%E8re%20Base%20-%207%20-%20Ligne%20de%20commande%20WB%20-%20HC%20N%B0005.jpg&type=thumb)
To create the data files of this analysis, we will use different methods available in WEBDEV.
<a name="NOTE5_2"></a>


### Creating a data file: using a preset data file
<a name="creating_data_file_using_preset_data_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000125"></a>

- The steps of the data file creation wizard are:

	1. In the wizard, select "Select a description among the preset data files". <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2_Ma%20Premi%E8re%20Base%20-%202%20-%20Fichier%20Client%20WB%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.jpg&type=thumb)
Go to the next step of the wizard.

	2. The list of preset data files is displayed. We are going to create the "Customer" data file. In the list of data files, select "Customer". Go to the next step.

	3. The wizard shows the list of items that will be included in Customer data file. This list allows you to manage several types of Customer data files.  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2_Ma%20Premi%E8re%20Base%20-%202%20-%20Fichier%20Client%20WB%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.jpg&type=thumb)


	4. Click "None" to deselect all items. Then, check the following items: CustomerID, Company, LastName, FirstName, Address, PostalCode, City, StateCounty, Country, Phone, Cell, Email.

5. Go to the next step of the wizard.

6. Validate the wizard. The "Customer" data file is automatically created in the data model editor.  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2_Ma%20Premi%E8re%20Base%20-%202%20-%20Fichier%20Client%20WB%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.jpg&type=thumb)



<a name="NOTE5_3"></a>


### Creating a data file: creating the data file and items
<a name="creating_data_file_creating_the_data_file_and_items_ELTPARAGRAPHE000144"></a>

- To create a data file from the element creation window:

	1. Click "Data" then "Data file".
			|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png) | Note | You can also create a data file from the data model editor: in the ribbon, on the "Analysis" tab, in the "Creation" group, click "New file". |





	2. The data file creation wizard starts.

	3. In the wizard, select "Create a new data file description".<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2_Ma%20Premi%E8re%20Base%20-%203%20-%20Fichier%20Commande%20WB%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.jpg&type=thumb)
Go to the next step of the wizard.

	4. We are going to create the "Order" data file. Name the data file "Order" in the wizard.
			This name will be used:

		- to manipulate the data file in the code. The variable associated with the data file will be "Order".

		- to build the name of the associated physical data file ("Order.fic" file).


 The caption and description of the elements represented by the records in the data file appear automatically.
			|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png) | Note | In the wizard, you can enter a clear description for the links between data files in the "A record represents" field. A description is automatically created based on the data file name.<br><br>In our case, type "An order". |


<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2_Ma%20Premi%E8re%20Base%20-%203%20-%20Fichier%20Commande%20WB%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.jpg)




We are going to create the items of the "Order" data file. In the description window of the items, you will notice that an item has already been automatically created: "OrderID". This item corresponds to the automatic identifier of the data file. This item consists of the letters "ID" and the name of the data file.

We are going to create the other items of this data file.

- First, we are going to create the "Date" item. This item will contain the order date.

	1. In the item description window, double-click in the "Name" column of the first empty row. This column automatically becomes editable. Type "Date".

	2. Click the "Caption" column. The item name is automatically displayed. Click the caption of the item to modify it: type "Order date". In the "Type" column, the "Text" type is automatically selected. Expand the list and select the "Date" type.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2_Ma%20Premi%E8re%20Base%20-%203%20-%20Fichier%20Commande%20WB%20-%20HC%20N%B0004.jpg)


	3. This item will be a key item (index) in the data file: keys are used access and sort data faster.
			|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png) | Note | A key is part of the item characteristics. When an item is created, you can specify whether it is:<br><br>		- not key,<br><br>		- unique key: the value of the key is unique in the entire data file (i.e. in all the data file records),<br><br>		- key with duplicates: the value of the key can be multiple times in the data file.<br><br><br> |





	- In the case of an SQL database, the engine optimizes the use of indices.

	- To loop through a data file in ascending or descending order, you can simply specify a sequential key.




- We will create the "Status" item to get the order status.

	1. Move the cursor to a new row in the table of items. Enter:

		- the name: Status

		- the caption: Order status

		- the type: Radio Button, List Box, Combo Box. In the window that appears, you can select the type of control to be created by default for this item. In this case, select Radio Button. Validate the window.




2. In the lower section of the screen, click the link to display the parameters of the control bound to the selected item. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2_Ma%20Premi%E8re%20Base%20-%203%20-%20Fichier%20Commande%20WB%20-%20HC%20N%B0004%202.jpg)
The information in the window displayed will be automatically used when creating pages linked to the data file. This window displays the type of control and the caption.
			We will define the different options corresponding to the order status in the "Content" tab:

	- Click the "Content" tab.

	- Option 1 corresponds to "Pending". Type "Pending" in the Edit control to the right of number 1.

	- Type "Validated" in the Edit control to the right of number 2.

	- Click the "+" icon to add a new option. 

	- Delete "Option 3" and type "Canceled".<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2_Ma%20Premi%E8re%20Base%20-%203%20-%20Fichier%20Commande%20WB%20-%20HC%20N%B0005.jpg&type=thumb)



<a name="NOTE5_4"></a>


### Importing a CSV file
<a name="importing_csv_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000259"></a>

A different method will be used to create the "PaymentMode" data file, which contains the payment characteristics: importing a CSV file.|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png) | Note | A CSV file is a text file that uses a specific format. This file contains data on each line. The data is separated by a separator character (usually a comma, a semi-colon or a tab). |



Based on the CSV file containing the data, WEBDEV will create:

- the description of the data file in the analysis,

- the HFSQL data file with the data in the CSV file.




- To import a CSV file into the analysis:

	1. In the ribbon, on the "Analysis" tab, in the "Creation" group, expand "Import" and select "Import file/table descriptions...".
			|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=astuce.png) | Tip | To import a CSV file (or any other file) into the analysis, you can also drag the CSV file from Windows explorer and drop it onto the data model editor. This will be presented in the next paragraph. |





	2. The file import wizard starts.

	3. Go to the next step.

	4. Select the format of the data file to import. In this case, select "Text file".<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2_Ma%20Premi%E8re%20Base%20-%204%20-%20Import%20CSV%20WB%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.jpg&type=thumb)
Go to the next step of the wizard.

	5. Specify the path of the file to import: "\\Tutorial\\WB\\Exercises\\My_WEBDEV_Site\\PaymentMode.csv" located in the WEBDEV installation directory.

	6. Go to the next step of the wizard.

	7. Specify the following import options:

		- Records delimited by: "&lt;Carriage return/Line feed&gt;"

		- Columns delimited by: "&lt;Semicolon&gt;"

		- Strings delimited by: "&lt;None&gt;"

		- Decimal separator: "&lt;Automatic: dot or comma&gt;" <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2_Ma%20Premi%E8re%20Base%20-%204%20-%20Import%20CSV%20WB%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.jpg&type=thumb)







- Let's examine the description of the imported data file:

	1. Select the "PaymentMode" data file, and then select "Data file description" in the context menu.

	2. Change the data file caption in the window that appears: delete "(Imported)".

	3. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2_Ma%20Premi%E8re%20Base%20-%207%20-%20Ligne%20de%20commande%20WB%20-%20HC%20N%B0001%201.jpg) (bottom left) to open the description of the data file items.

	4. This data file does not have an automatic identifier or a unique key. We will set the "Code" item as a unique key:

		- Select the "Code" item if necessary.

		- On the right side of the screen, click "Unique key".<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2_Ma%20Premi%E8re%20Base%20-%204%20-%20Import%20CSV%20WB%20-%20HC%20N%B0005.jpg)






<a name="NOTE5_5"></a>


### Importing existing data files directly
<a name="importing_existing_data_files_directly_ELTPARAGRAPHE000336"></a>

The last method for creating data files consists in importing the existing HFSQL data files. We will use this method to create the "Product" data file.



- To import HFSQL data files:

	1. In the Windows file explorer, open the following WEBDEV subdirectory: "\\Tutorial\\WB\\Exercises\\My_WEBDEV_Site".

	2. Select the "Product.fic" file.

	3. Drag the "Product" data file and drop it onto the WEBDEV data model editor.

	4. The data file appears in the data model editor.





All necessary data files are now in the data model editor.|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=avertissement.png) | Caution! | Only the description of the "Product" data file was imported into the analysis of our project. The data from the "Product" data file has not been imported into the project yet. |







- To manipulate the data from the file that has been just imported: 

	1. Open the project directory: on the "Home" tab, in the "General" group, click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_Rep_Projet_GAF.jpg). 

	2. Open a new file explorer on the "\\Tutorial\\WB\\Exercises\\My_WEBDEV_Site" directory.

	3. Copy the "Product.fic", "Product.mmo" and "Product.ndx" files from "\\Tutorial\\WB\\Exercises\\My_WEBDEV_Site" and paste them into the EXE subdirectory of the project directory.
			Remark: Three files must be copied: 

		- "Product.fic": file containing the data, 

		- "Product.mmo": memo file containing the product images, 

		- "Product.ndx": file containing the indices to optimize searches in the data file. 







<a name="NOTE6"></a>
<a name="NOTE6_1"></a>


## Creating links
<a name="creating_links_ELTTEXTE000966"></a>
We have created all the descriptions of the data files necessary for the product management application.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2_Ma%20Premi%E8re%20Base%20-%205%20-%20Import%20FIC%20WB%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.jpg&type=thumb)
Now we will create the links between the data files. A link is used to define the integrity constraints (cardinalities) between two data files. 



- First, let's create the link between the "Customer" and "Order" data files: a customer can have one or more orders, and each order is linked to a customer.

	1. In the ribbon, on the "Analysis" tab, in the "Creation" group, click "New link". The mouse cursor turns into a pen.

	2. Click the "Customer" data file, then the "Order" data file.

	3. The link creation wizard starts.

	4. Answer the questions asked by the wizard:  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2_Ma%20Premi%E8re%20Base%20-%206%20-%20Liaisons%20WB%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.jpg&type=thumb)


		- Each Customer has at least one Order: No

- Each Customer can have several Orders: Yes

- Each Order has at least one Customer: Yes

- Each Order can have several Customers: No
						|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png) | Note | You can also specify the link cardinalities directly in the wizard.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2_Ma%20Premi%E8re%20Base%20-%206%20-%20Liaisons%20WB%20-%20HC%20N%B0001%201.jpg)<br> |





5. Go to the next step. The wizard automatically shows the key used by the link (CustomerID).<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2_Ma%20Premi%E8re%20Base%20-%206%20-%20Liaisons%20WB%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.jpg&type=thumb)




- Likewise, create a link between the "PaymentMode" and "Order" data files. These two data files are linked as follows:

	- An order must have a payment mode.

	- A payment mode can be used in several orders.


 In the wizard:

- The cardinalities are as follows: PaymentMode (0, n), Order (1, 1).

- The link key corresponds to the "Code" item.




- Now we will create a link between the "Order" and "Product" data files. This link will be used to create a link file, the data file that corresponds to the order lines.

	1. Likewise, create the link between the "Order" and "Product" data files.

	2. Answer the questions asked by the wizard:

		- Each Order has at least one Product: No

		- Each Order can have several Products: Yes

		- Each Product has at least one Order: No

		- Each Product can have several Orders: Yes<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2_Ma%20Premi%E8re%20Base%20-%206%20-%20Liaisons%20WB%20-%20HC%20N%B0004.jpg&type=thumb)







We will modify the relation file created by WEBDEV. This file will contain the order lines.

We are going to:

- Modify the name of the relation file.

- Modify the name of its items.

- Add items to get the quantity of products ordered and the total of the order line.




- First, we will rename the relation file. We already did something similar when we changed the caption of the imported data file. However, in this case, not only the caption will be modified: we will also rename the physical file linked to the data file description.

	1. Select the "Order_Product" data file. In the context menu, select "Data file description".

	2. In the window that appears, change:

		- the name of the data file to "OrderLine".

		- the name on the disk to "OrderLine".<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2_Ma%20Premi%E8re%20Base%20-%207%20-%20Ligne%20de%20commande%20WB%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.jpg&type=thumb)







- We will now modify the items of this relation file.

	1. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2_Ma%20Premi%E8re%20Base%20-%207%20-%20Ligne%20de%20commande%20WB%20-%20HC%20N%B0001%201.jpg) (bottom left) to open the description of the data file items.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2_Ma%20Premi%E8re%20Base%20-%207%20-%20Ligne%20de%20commande%20WB%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.jpg)


	2. This data file has 3 items. Select the "OrderID_Reference" item. This item is a composite key.
			|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png) | Note | A composite key is a set of items that constitute an index.<br><br>This type of key is used to loop through the data file based on complex criteria or to perform specific searches on several items at the same time. |





3. To rename this item:

	- Click the "Name" column.

	- Replace "OrderID_Reference" with "OrderLineID".

	- Click the "Caption" column.

	- Replace the current caption with "OrderLine ID".




- Now we are now going to add 3 new items to this relation file: Quantity, TotalIOT and TotalBT.

	1. Move the cursor to a new row and create the "Quantity" item. Select the "Numeric" type for this item.

	2. Move the cursor to a new table row and create the "TotalIOT" item. Select the "Currency" type for this item.

	3. A window appears, indicating that the item already exists in the analysis and prompts you to use its characteristics:  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2_Ma%20Premi%E8re%20Base%20-%207%20-%20Ligne%20de%20commande%20WB%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.jpg)


	4. Keep the default options and validate ("OK").

5. Move the cursor to a new table row and create the "TotalBT" item. Select the "Currency" type for this item. Once again, use the existing description.

6. The description of the "OrderLine" data file items is as follows.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2_Ma%20Premi%E8re%20Base%20-%207%20-%20Ligne%20de%20commande%20WB%20-%20HC%20N%B0004.jpg)




- The analysis is as follows:  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2_Ma%20Premi%E8re%20Base%20-%207%20-%20Ligne%20de%20commande%20WB%20-%20HC%20N%B0005.jpg&type=thumb)

## Generating the analysis
<a name="generating_the_analysis_ELTTEXTE001026"></a>
The generation of the analysis consists in validating the changes made to the analysis (create data files, add or delete items, etc.) and applying them to the entire project (pages, bound controls, reports, etc.).

If changes have been made to the analysis, a synchronization dialog box appears automatically when the data model editor is closed.

You can also generate the analysis manually. That's what we are going to do.

- To generate the analysis:

	1. In the ribbon of the data model editor, go to the "Analysis" tab, "Analysis" group and click "Generation". 

	2. The analysis generation starts automatically.





The descriptions of the analysis data files have been modified.

- To update the data files of the application, WEBDEV prompts you to synchronize the structure of deployed data (also referred to as "modification procedure of data files"). This operation updates the physical data files (".fic" files) based on their description in the analysis.




- Click the "Start" button. 




- The automatic modification wizard starts. 

	1. Validate the different steps of the wizard until you reach the list of data files to be taken into account:  <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2_Ma%20Premi%E8re%20Base%20-%207%20-%20Ligne%20de%20commande%20WB%20-%20HC%20N%B0006.jpg&type=thumb)


		- The PaymentMode data file must be updated. Keep this file selected.

- The Product data file was copied into the project directory. WEBDEV prompts you to associate it with the analysis. Check the data file. 

2. Go to the next step.

3. The wizard proposes to make a back up copy of the existing data files, don't change anything and go to the next step.

4. The wizard allows you to define a password to protect the data files that were modified during the automatic modification. Keep the default options and go to the next step.

5. The list of data files to modify is displayed. Finish the wizard.

6. The data files are updated.




- Close the data model editor.




We have covered the main steps to create an analysis.

Once the analysis has been described and generated, you can:

- Create a full website via the RAD (Rapid Application Development) methodology. 
	For more details, see [Creating an application using the RAD methodology](../Editeurs/2031042.md). 

- Create a full custom website. We will use this method to develop a full website based on a database in part 3 of this tutorial. This website will be based on the analysis you created in this part.
