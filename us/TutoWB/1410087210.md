## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000135"></a>
WEBDEV allows you to create applications/sites that access HFSQL Client/Server databases.

The Client/Server mode allows you to host databases on a server (it can be different from the server where the site is deployed).

This operating mode:

- increases data security, 

- allows you to easily manage the multi-user mode, 

- simplifies maintenance, 

- allows for remote connections (for back-office operations, for example).

WEBDEV allows you to:

- create a site that uses an HFSQL Client/Server database.

- modify a site that uses an HFSQL Classic database so that it can use an HFSQL Client/Server database.

## Why switch a site to HFSQL Client/Server?
<a name="why_switch_site_hfsql_clientserver_ELTTEXTE000159"></a>
The main advantages of a site in HFSQL Client/Server mode compared to a site in HFSQL Classic mode are as follows:

- HFSQL Client/Server is more secure (you can create a username and password and grant rights to the users).

- No need to manage directories: all database files are in the same folder.

- Client/Server databases can be used with an Internet connection.

- Management of native multi-user mode: performance is optimized in multi-user mode.
