## Securing data and pages via TLS/SSL
<a name="securing_data_and_pages_via_tlsssl_ELTTEXTE000202"></a>


### Overview
<a name="overview_ELTPARAGRAPHE000024"></a>

By default, the data exchanged between the end user computer and the web server is not protected. This data is not encrypted while being transferred over the network.

There are several systems to secure data. A common system consists in using the TLS (Transport Layer Security) / SSL (Secure Socket Layer) protocol. 
The data is not longer exchanged via the HTTP protocol but via the HTTPS protocol (for example: https://customers.mywebdevsite.com/customers).

### Implementing secure transactions via the TLS/SSL protocol
<a name="implementing_secure_transactions_via_the_tlsssl_protocol_ELTPARAGRAPHE000034"></a>

To implement secure transactions via TLS and SSL, you must install a certificate on the web server and configure the web server.

Two different methods can be used to get a certificate:

1. Buying it from a certified authority.

2. Generating a self-signed certificate.




For more details on certificates, see [Creating an SSL certificate that can be used with SocketCreateSSL](../WDLang3/3070021.md).

### Securing transactions via TLS/SSL in a WEBDEV site
<a name="securing_transactions_via_tlsssl_webdev_site_ELTPARAGRAPHE000051"></a>

Secure mode is implemented when required by a page (e.g. to enter credit card info).

All you have to do is call [SSLActive](../WDLang2/3012014.md) in the browser code of the button that opens the page.

As soon as the secure page is opened, all actions performed will be in secure mode (i.e. encrypted), regardless of the objects used (Link, Table, Looper controls, etc.).

For more details, see the help about [SSLActive](../WDLang2/3012014.md).

## Secure payment

### Overview
<a name="overview_ELTPARAGRAPHE000072"></a>

Most business sites allowing users to perform an online purchase use a system for online payment by credit card.

The secure payment is an essential feature for an e-commerce site. The payment solution must reassure the user ("customer") and guarantee the payment to the business site.

The data exchanged during this transaction must be secured (via the SSL protocol that was described in the previous paragraph for example).

Several payment solutions are available (PayBox, ATOS, CyberMut, CyperPaiement, SPPlus, etc.).

The secure payment may change slightly from one provider to another, but it remains generally the same for all of them: ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WB_Paiement-securise.gif)


- 1 to 4. Preparing the order on the e-commerce site: users place their orders on the site. During the payment operation, the e-commerce site transfers the information used to identify the order (vendor number, invoice amount, etc.) to the payment operator.

- 5 to 7. Typing and checking the credit card number: users type their credit card number in a secure payment page. The data transmission is protected via SSL to ensure data confidentiality. The business site does not know the credit card number typed by the user.

- 8. Back to the e-commerce site: the payment operator indicates to the e-commerce site whether the payment was validated, canceled or refused.

### Secure payment system in a WEBDEV site
<a name="secure_payment_system_webdev_site_ELTPARAGRAPHE000095"></a>

**General steps**

In most cases, the following operations must be performed when implementing a secure payment solution:

1. Request a development kit from the payment operator (PayBox, ATOS, SIPS, CyberMut, etc.).

2. Contact the payment operator to establish a contract for remote sales. At this step, the bank provides a vendor number.

3. Contact the payment operator to establish a contract specifying the parameters for the remote sales contract.

4. Implement the business site.




**Using the component provided with WEBDEV: "Secure payment component"**

WEBDEV includes several components to make online payments.
The "Secure payment" component includes multiple secure payment modes. The "Secure payment" component is provided with its source code and a use example.



- To open the example of the "Secure payment" component:

	1. Go to the WEBDEV home page (Ctrl + &lt;). 

	2. Click "Open an example". 

	3. In the search box, type "Payment". 

	4. Click the "WW_SecurePayment" example: the corresponding project opens automatically in the editor.

	5. In the "Project explorer" pane, select the "Example" configuration. 

	6. You can test the example.
