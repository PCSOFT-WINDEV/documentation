## What does "mobile-friendly" mean?
<a name="what_does_mobilefriendly_mean_ELTTEXTE000122"></a>
More and more people are using their phones or tablets to access Internet and Intranet sites. This means that sites must be designed in a way so that they adapt easily to mobile devices (phones or tablets).

In a mobile-friendly site, users should be able to access all the main information of the website from their devices, without having to zoom or reduce the pages.

### Concepts in WEBDEV
<a name="concepts_webdev_ELTPARAGRAPHE000032"></a>

WEBDEV includes various methods to make sites mobile-friendly: 

- **Dynamic Serving**: "Dynamic serving" is a technique where the same address (URL) leads to 2 different pages: a page for PC and a page for mobile. The page will be displayed based on the device (PC or mobile) that opens it.
	With "Dynamic serving", you no longer need to modify the existing pages: simply add mobile-specific pages.
	However, this method requires using two sets of pages, and therefore two sets of code to be executed. 

- **Legacy Responsive Web Design**: With this method, pages are divided into resolution ranges (slices) that adapt the website to mobile devices. This solution allows you to use the same code regardless of the target device. However, this edit mode requires great attention to detail.  

- **Layouts**. We have already mentioned and explained this method in the different parts of this tutorial. By using layouts, you can quickly implement a specific interface for mobile devices. The code remains the same. Simply move, hide or configure the different controls in the mobile layout. The WYSIWYG page editor shows your changes immediately. 




In the rest of this lesson, we will manipulate layouts and use various techniques to implement them in the different pages of your websites.
