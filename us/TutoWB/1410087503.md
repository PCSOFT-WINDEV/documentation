## What is a cookie?
<a name="what_cookie_ELTTEXTE000179"></a>
A cookie is an easy way to temporarily store information on the user's computer. This information can be read later by the site that created the cookie.

This allows you to keep previously specified details and show custom pages.|   |   |   |

| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=internet.png) | Internet | A cookie has an expiration date (30 days by default). It is automatically destroyed by the user's browser if its lifespan is exceeded.<br><br>Caution: The use of cookies is only possible if the user's browser is configured to accept cookies. |



Cookies can be used to store information on the user's computer, such as the user's name, pages visited, date of last connection, preferences, etc.

This information, saved as cookies, will be read next time the user visits the site. Therefore, the site will be able to show custom information to the user:

- ad banners based on what users have viewed during their last visit,

- a custom home page with the username and the date of last connection,

- special offers based on the user's searches during the last visit, etc.

### What is stored in a cookie?
<a name="what_stored_cookie_ELTPARAGRAPHE000047"></a>

A cookie is a text file stored on the user's computer (in most cases, in the browser's Internet "cache") for a specific duration. The cookie is created by the browser or by the server.

The following elements are required to store information in a cookie:

- Name of the cookie, used by the site to identify the cookie.

- Text of the cookie, corresponding to the information written by the site: pages visited, details provided by the user, etc.

- Expiration date after which the cookie is not valid anymore (it will be automatically deleted).

- Name of the Internet domain that created the cookie.

- To test how cookies are managed, we will import the "Cookies" unit example into the "Full_WEBDEV_Site" project.

	1. Go to the WEBDEV home page (Ctrl + &lt;).

	2. On the home page, click "Tutorial", then in "Part 7 - Lesson 7.2 - Cookies", double-click "Full WEBDEV Site - Answers".







- To open a unit example:

	1. Go to the WEBDEV home page (Ctrl + &lt;). 

	2. Click "Open an example". 

	3. Enter "Cookies" in the search box. The "Cookies" unit example appears in the window.

	4. Click the name of the unit example.

## How to use cookies?
<a name="how_use_cookies_ELTTEXTE000251"></a>
Cookies can be used according to two different modes:

- Cookies used in Server code.

- Cookies used in Browser code.




To use cookies, WEBDEV includes 2 functions that can be used both in server code and in browser code:

- [CookieWrite](../WDLang2/3012008.md): is used to send a cookie when the HTML page is displayed in the user's browser.

- [CookieRead](../WDLang2/3012009.md): is used to retrieve the value of a cookie saved on the user's computer.




The "PAGE_Cookies" example page presents an example for reading and writing a cookie in server code and in browser code.

For more details, see [Managing cookies](../WDLang2/3012006.md).
