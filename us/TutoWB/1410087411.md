## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000239"></a>
When designing a website, you may have to handle data. To store the data, you must create a "database".

The first thing you should do in a WEBDEV project that handles data is create an "analysis".

An "analysis" contains the description of data files (or tables). The application data will be saved in the data files.

When the website is run, these descriptions will be used to create the database and/or the data files. Data will be stored in this database or these data files.|   |   |   |

| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png)<br> | Note | Several HFSQL database maintenance tools are provided with WEBDEV. They can be accessed from the HFSQL Control Center. |




WEBDEV supports most of the database formats (nearly all of them). The most common formats are:

- HFSQL, a database system provided with WEBDEV. The HFSQL database is available in Classic or Client/Server mode.

- AS/400, Access, Sybase, Informix, etc.

- Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, etc.

- Any database accessible in SQL language in Windows.

- Text (ASCII files).




Several methods can be used to access data:

- Native Connector (also called Native Access), 

- OLE DB access,

- Direct ODBC access,

- ODBC access via OLE DB.

## HFSQL
<a name="hfsql_ELTTEXTE000281"></a>
HFSQL is a powerful, fast and reliable database.

HFSQL runs on Windows and Linux, on mobile devices (iOS, Android), networks of any size and type, and automatically manages hundreds of concurrent accesses.

HFSQL is available in Classic and Client/Server mode.

HFSQL can be freely distributed with your WEBDEV sites.

HFSQL includes all the features of a database, especially:

- [logging](../WDLang4/3044184.md),

- [transactions](../WDLang4/3044335.md),

- [replication](../WDLang4/3044266.md),

- [triggers](../WDLang4/3044272.md).




In the different parts of this tutorial, we will use an HFSQL Classic database and then, an HFSQL Client/Server database.

## Different modes for accessing databases
<a name="different_modes_for_accessing_databases_ELTTEXTE000305"></a>


### Native Connector (Native Access)
<a name="native_connector_native_access_ELTPARAGRAPHE000086"></a>

A Native Connector uses a database format directly and exclusively. This optimized type of access is developed specifically for each database format.

In WEBDEV, a Native Connector is available for the following databases:

- HFSQL Classic or Client/Server (standard).

- Access (standard).

- SQLite (standard).

- Oracle (optional).

- AS/400 (optional).

- SQL Server (optional).

- Sybase (optional).

- Informix (optional).

- DB2 (optional).

- Progress (optional).

- MySQL (optional and free).

- PostgreSQL (optional and free).

- MariaDB (optional and free).


If you have any questions about these Native Connectors, contact our sales department.

The **SQL\*** and **HRead\*** functions in WLanguage can be used with this type of access. The code is portable and independent of the database.
<a name="NOTE4_2"></a>


### Direct ODBC access
<a name="direct_odbc_access_ELTPARAGRAPHE000113"></a>

An access via ODBC uses a multi-database access standard. The ODBC layer must be installed on your computer. In most cases, this layer is already installed in the recent Windows versions. This can be checked in the Windows control panel by selecting "ODBC data source" (or "ODBC administrator" according to the Windows version used).

Caution: some databases may not be accessible via this method. If you want to use this type of access, check whether an ODBC driver exists and install this driver if necessary.

Only the **SQL\*** WLanguage functions can be used with this type of access.
<a name="NOTE4_3"></a>


### OLE DB access
<a name="ole_access_ELTPARAGRAPHE000124"></a>

OLE DB uses a multi-database access standard. This type of access is based on MDAC (Microsoft Data Access Component).|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=avertissement.png)<br> | Caution! | If you are using an OLE DB access, MDAC must necessarily be installed on the user computers (version 2.6 or later). |



Some databases may not be accessible via this method. If you want to use this type of access, check whether an OLE DB driver exists.

The **SQL\*** and **HRead\*** functions in WLanguage can be used with this type of access.
<a name="NOTE4_4"></a>


### ODBC access via OLE DB
<a name="odbc_access_via_ole_ELTPARAGRAPHE000138"></a>

In summary, it is a "mix" of OLE DB and ODBC. This is the "heaviest" and least efficient method in terms of performance. It should not be used on small databases. 

The **SQL\*** and **HRead\*** functions in WLanguage can be used with this type of access.

## Project with analysis
<a name="project_with_analysis_ELTTEXTE000365"></a>
In this part of the tutorial, we will create and associate a project with an HFSQL database.

You will discover some key elements to develop a site that uses data files:

- Creating a WEBDEV project.

- Defining the data files used by the site.




In a following part, we will focus on the development of the elements of a website with data (pages, reports, etc.). This website will be developed from scratch, from the interface to the final distribution. You will see the main points for developing a site.

In this part, we will also create a database to manage orders.

The same type of database will be used in part 3 of this tutorial to develop a full site. We will use HFSQL Classic, a free database provided with WEBDEV. The HFSQL Client/Server database will be presented later in this tutorial.
