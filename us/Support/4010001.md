- Reproducibility - if your problem appears randomly, it is probably not isolated enough and it will be very difficult to provide you with an efficient help.

- Isolation - it is important to check that the behavior of your code is independent of the context. To do so, we recommend that you try to reproduce it in a new window, even in a new project.

- Precision - If an error message is displayed, write it down (word for word) or even better, perform a screen shot.
