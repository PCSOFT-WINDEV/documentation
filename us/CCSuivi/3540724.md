The Project Monitoring Center is used to follow the tasks of one or more contributors via: 

- the task list ("Tasks" tab), 

- the schedule ("Schedule" tab), 

- the Gantt chart ("Gantt chart" tab). 




The Gantt chart allows you to easily organize the tasks of different contributors in the projects.

The remaining time of each task is indicated. This information appears in the printed version.
