The management of messages found in the Project Monitoring Center allows you to use the secure messaging included in the development environment of WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile (WDBal tool). 

This management of messages is performed via a "Messages" tab. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Messagerie_Message%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.gif&type=thumb)

	- Forward: A new message is created, from the content of the existing message. This new message has no default recipient. New recipients must be added. 




- Print ghe message (directly or via a preview). 

- Copy the message text. 

- Move the message to a custom folder. 

- Perform a search in the message
