## What is a project?
<a name="what_project_ELTTEXTE000163"></a>
A project corresponds to a work project. This project involves one or more persons (called contributors).

Each project is associated with:

- contributors, 

- tasks to perform.




![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) **Remark**: A working project and a [spool of requests](../CCSuivi/3540707.md) are automatically created when the option "Suggestions, problems..." of the [automatic menu (? menu)](../Editeurs/9000070.md) is included in the WINDEV application. This working project and this spool of requests are automatically associated with the corresponding WINDEV application.

### Creating a project
<a name="creating_project_ELTPARAGRAPHE000060"></a>

A project can be created by a contributor or by an administrator (by default, the login and password correspond to "ADMIN").

To create a project: 

1. Expand ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CC_Suivi_Configuration%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif) and select "Projects" to display the list of projects.

2. Click the "+" button.

3. Enter the requested information: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Ajout_Prj_general.gif)


	- ***Name***: Name of the project that will be used in the different Control Centers to identify the project.

- ***Description***: Brief description of the project.

- ***Version***, for the projects that require several versions.

- ***Type of application***: This information is useful for a project linked to a WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile project. Indeed, this option allows you to easily identify the support of the final application. For the other projects, all you have to do is select "Various";.

- ***Location*** (for the projects associated with WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile projects): Used to quickly open the project from the Control Center. The project can be found in the SCM or it can be accessible from the computer (the path of the project must be specified). This information is optional.

- ***Group***:  Used to group the projects. All you have to do is select the group of projects associated with the project. If the requested group does not exist, the "+" button is used to create a new group of projects. A group of projects can be created by the administrators only.   

- ***Path***, for the projects associated with WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile projects: This information is used to quickly open the project from the Control Center. The project is not directly modified.

- ***Spool***: List of future tasks associated with the project. A new spool can be created if necessary.

- ***Color*** associated with the project: This color will be used to easily identify the project in the schedule or in the task list.

4. When the project is validated, the list of contributors associated with this project is displayed (see the paragraph below).

<a name="associating_contributors_with_project_ELTPARAGRAPHE000087"></a>

To associate contributors with a project:

1. Expand ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CC_Suivi_Configuration%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif) and select "Projects" to display the list of projects.

4. The list of available contributors is displayed. Select the contributor and transfer him to the list of contributors associated with the project. For each contributor, you have the ability to define whether this contributor is:

	- Project manager. In this case, the contributor will be able to add and delete tasks, to assign tasks to other contributors, ...

	- Development manager.

	- Test manager.

	- Documentation manager.

	- Database manager.

	- Backup manager.




5. Remarks:

	- The teams of contributors can also be directly selected from the "Teams" tab.

	- If the requested contributors are not found in the list, you must [create a contributor](../CCSuivi/3540703.md).




6. One or more project managers can be defined. To do so, click the "Manag" box next to the name. Caution: a project manager is not necessarily an administrator (and conversely).

7. Validate.


**Remark**: Only the project manager or an administrator of the Control Centers can associate contributors with a project.
