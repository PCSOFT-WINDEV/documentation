## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000436"></a>
The following steps must be performed to implement the requirements:

1. [Creating a list of requirements](#NOTE2_1). This list can for example group the necessary requirements for a new software version.

2. [Creating requirements](#NOTE3_1).

3. [Assigning the different dependencies to requirements](../CCSuivi/3540718.md) (tasks, business rules, etc.).

4. [Monitoring the requirements](../CCSuivi/3540718.md).

## Creating a list of requirements
<a name="creating_list_requirements_ELTTEXTE000460"></a>
A list of requirements must be created before you can manage the requirements.

**To create a list of requirements**: 

1. Display or create a "Requirements" pane in the Project Monitoring Center. 

2. In the "Management" group, click "List of requirements". 

3. Click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=IconeAjouterPropriete.gif) and select "New list of requirements". 

4. In the window that appears, you can specify the characteristics of the list in the "General" tab:<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Exigence_Creation%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif)


	- The list name.

- The linked document (if necessary). 

- The option "There must be a manager for all the requirements in the list" makes it mandatory to set a manager for each requirement in the list. The manager will not be able to validate their task if another participant still has a task associated with the non-validated requirement.

- The list description.

5. In the "Rights" tab, specify: 

	- The managers of the list of requirements. These persons will be able to modify the requirements found in the list.

	- The rights that will be granted to the contributors of Control Centers: the contributors defined in the Control Centers may have (or may not have) the rights to:

		- See the requirements found in the list.

		- Modify the requirements found in the list.

		- Add dependencies (which means add tasks, business rules and/or incidents)

		- Delete dependencies (which means delete tasks, business rules and/or incidents). 
						**Caution**: Deleting dependencies is a strategic operation because deleting a dependency may validate a requirement.
						**Remark**: The full rights are granted to the managers of the list of requirements.




6. The "Additional items" tab allows you to specify, if necessary, the additional items to be managed by the requirement list. These items can be used to manage the customer agreement, the standard service, ... Up to 3 additional items can be added to each one of the requirements found in the list. This information will be displayed in the "Other information" pane of requirement description and in the list of requirements.
	To take a new item into account:

	- Check the line corresponding to the new item.

	- In the table, modify the caption of the item as well as its type.

	- Check the corresponding box if the item must be taken into account in the search by keywords.

	- Specify (if necessary) the default value of item.




7. Validate. The window for managing lists of requirements is displayed.

8. Validate.

### Special case: The requirement templates
<a name="special_case_the_requirement_templates_ELTPARAGRAPHE000192"></a>

In some cases, you may want to use the requirement templates.

**To create a requirement template**, all you have to do is create a new requirement and specify in the "Template" tab that the requirement is a template.

Then, **a requirement can be created from a template** from the "Requirement" tab: in the ribbon, in the "Requirements" group, expand "New requirement" and select "Creation from a template". 

To do so, specify the template to use in the window that is opened.

**Remark**: The "Requirement" tab proposes several display filters ("Additional filters" option). In the proposed filters, you have the ability to display (or not) the requirement templates.

## Importing requirements
<a name="importing_requirements_ELTTEXTE000538"></a>


### Overview
<a name="overview_ELTPARAGRAPHE000209"></a>

The Project Monitoring Center allows you to import requirements. These requirements can be in an RTF or XLS file with a specific format.
<a name="NOTE4_2"></a>


### How to import a list of requirements
<a name="how_import_list_requirements_ELTPARAGRAPHE000216"></a>

To import a list of requirements:

1. Display or create a "Requirement" tab. 

2. In the ribbon, in the "Management" group, click "Lists of requirements". 

3. In the window, click the ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Import_Exigence.gif) button. 

4. Select the file to import.

5. Validate.



<a name="NOTE4_3"></a>


### Import in RTF
<a name="import_rtf_ELTPARAGRAPHE000231"></a>

The RTF file must have the following structure:

- Each requirement must start with a "Title:" tag (or "Titre:"): Example: "Title: Test requirement 1".

- Each requirement data must be preceded by the corresponding tag. The tag must be found at the beginning of the line.

- For the following tags, the value must be found on the same line as the tag: 

	- "Title"

	- "Creation date"

	- "Deadline"

	- "Author"

	- "Priority"

	- "Test"

	- "Dev Coeff."

	- "Test Coeff."




- For the following tags, the value starts after the tag and stops before the next tag: 

	- "Description"

	- "Comment"







Example:  


|   |
| --- |
| Description:<br>The description of a requirement is multiline.<br>It is in RTF. The RTF formatting is kept.<br>It may contain empty lines.<br> |



- Inside a requirement, the value of a tag is imported once only. The tag is then considered as being "normal" text.




Example:


|   |
| --- |
| Creation date: 11/07/2007<br>Description:<br>Beginning of description<br>Creation date: 11/07/2007<br>End of description |

In this case, as "Creation date" was already imported before the "Description", the description is entirely imported (from the "beginning" line to the "end" line).

- The text found outside a value is ignored (text before the first "Title" or text after a single-line tag).

- The values that do not exist in the record are initialized to their default values.

- French tag names and English tag names can be mixed.

- List of imported tags:

### Import in XLS format
<a name="import_xls_format_ELTPARAGRAPHE000355"></a>

The XLS file must have the following structure:

- The first line must contain the title of columns.

- There must be at least one "Title" column or one "Description" column.

- If the name of the column does not correspond to an expected name, its content is ignored.

- The non-existing columns are initialized with their default values.
