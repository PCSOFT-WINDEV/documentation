	- the view mode: 

		- "Development": Incidents created or fixed over the given time period and assigned to the selected contributors. 

		- "Test": Incidents created or fixed over the given time period and whose contributors are also the authors. 




- the contributors(s) included in the trend. If no contributor is selected, all the contributors will be included.
