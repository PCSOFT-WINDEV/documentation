## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000326"></a>
The Project Monitoring Center is used to define the different tasks assigned to each project contributor.

These tasks can be created by the contributor or by an administrator (by default, the login and password correspond to "ADMIN").

The schedule of the contributor is built dynamically according to the order of the tasks.

The tasks are managed in the "Tasks" tabs.

Different types of tasks can be created:

- **Standard task** (project-related or personal).

- **Interrupting task**: unscheduled task that may interrupt the calculation of the time spent on a task ("Meal", "Meeting", ...). This type of task is taken into account by the [time management mechanism](../CCSuivi/3540711.md).

### Adding a new standard task
<a name="adding_new_standard_task_ELTPARAGRAPHE000031"></a>

The tasks can be added by an administrator or by the contributor himself.

To add a task:

1. Open or create a "Tasks" tab. 

2. Select: 

	- "Add a task" in the context menu of the task list

	- the "New task" option in the tab ribbon. 




3. Specify the characteristics of the task:<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CC_Suivi_Tache%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif&type=thumb)
The main sections are as follows:

	- ***Title***: this title summarizes the task to perform. This title will be displayed in the schedule and in the task list.

	- ***Associated project***: Name of project associated with the task. You have the ability to select an existing project, create a new project or create a "Personal tasks" project.

	- ***Personal tasks (outside project)***: Used to specify that the task is a personal task linked to no project.

	- ***Status***: Task status. A task can be Pending, In progress, Locked, Canceled or Completed. This status can be modified by the contributor.

	- ***Contributor***: Contributor associated with the task.

	- ***Estimated duration, time passed and deadline***: Estimated task duration. A duration set to null is used to create a task with an undefined duration.

	- ***Document***: File linked to the task (WINDEV window, WEBDEV page, ...).

	- ***Details***: Description of the task, or description the dialog with the administrator or other contributors. The name and the date can be included in a text ("Insert Name" button). 

	- ***Linked requirements***: link between the task and one or more existing requirements. 




4. Validate.

5. The task is automatically displayed in the task list. The task list is used to specify the order in which the tasks will be performed (this order will be used to build the schedule). 




**Remarks**:

- A new task can also be added from a request found in a [spool of requests](../CCSuivi/3540707.md).

- Several tabs are used to give information about a task:

	- Details: Task details. This information is entered when creating the task.

	- Linked requirements: Requirements linked to the task. This information is entered when creating the task.

	- Linked tasks: Used to see or create linked tasks. For more details, see [Creating a link between tasks](#NOTE3_1). 

	- Elements of the project: List of project elements associated with the task. For example, if the task affects the modification of a WINDEV project, this tab can display the list of relevant windows.

	- Source Code Manager: If the project is associated with a WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile project found in the SCM, allows you to see the different operations made in the SCM to perform the task.




- Exporting tasks: From the task list, you can extract the contributor's schedule in Rich Text Format. To do so, select "Extract schedule" in the context menu and select the desired time range in the window that appears. The schedule is automatically copied to the clipboard.

### Adding a new interrupting task
<a name="adding_new_interrupting_task_ELTPARAGRAPHE000095"></a>

The interrupting tasks can be added by the contributor himself. For more details on how interruption tasks work, see [Time management help](../CCSuivi/3540711.md).

To add an interrupting task:

1. Open or create a "Tasks" tab. 

2. In the "Management" group, click "Interrupting tasks". 

3. In the window that appears, click "New interrupting task". 

4. Enter the name of the interrupting task. 

5. Validate.




**Remark**: Only the first eight interrupting tasks are taken into account by the task wheel.
<a name="NOTE2_3"></a>


### Defining the task "In progress"
<a name="defining_the_task_progress_ELTPARAGRAPHE000115"></a>

To define the task "In progress":

1. Open or create a "Tasks" tab. 

2. Select the task that must be flagged "In progress".

3. In the "Tasks" group of the ribbon, click "Start". You can also select "Start task" in the context menu. 

4. A window is displayed:<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CC_Suivi_Tache%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif&type=thumb)
 This window is used to:

	- modify the date and time for changing task (in case you've forgotten to change task for instance).

	- specify the status of the previous task (task locked, canceled, in progress).




5. The task becomes the first task displayed in the task list.




**Remark**: Mode for calculating the duration of a task:

- **If the time management help is enabled**: 
	The calculation of the time spent on a task takes into account:

	- the information specified in the task wheel and in the window for managing the current task. The working hours and the working days specified in the options of Project Monitoring Center are ignored.

	- the automatic lock of the current task when closing the Windows session.

	- the automatic lock of the current task when closing the Project Monitoring Center of WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile.
			In this case, the information entered in the schedule configuration is taken into account only when establishing the schedule. The schedule takes into account the time really spent.




- **If the time management help is not enabled**: 
	The calculation of the time spent on a task only takes into account the working times and the working days specified in the schedule configuration. The "overtime" is not taken into account.

## Link between tasks
<a name="link_between_tasks_ELTTEXTE000410"></a>


### Overview
<a name="overview_ELTPARAGRAPHE000201"></a>

In the "Tasks" tab, you have the ability to define a sequence for performing tasks (via the arrow buttons found on the right of the list). 

However, you may also have to define a dependency between tasks in addition to this sequence. For example, updating the special offers in a site must be performed once the promotion file is updated. 

These links are also taken into account when displaying the [Gantt chart](../CCSuivi/3540724.md). 


### How to create a link between tasks?
<a name="how_create_link_between_tasks_ELTPARAGRAPHE000213"></a>

To perform a link between several tasks: 

1. Open the description window of one of the tasks to link ("Modify task" in the context menu). 

2. In the lower section of modification window, display the "Linked tasks" tab. 

3. Click the "+" button. 

	- If the task is not linked to a requirement, the list of available tasks is automatically displayed. 

	- If the task is linked to a requirement, the "+" button proposes 2 choices: "Link to a requirement task" and "Link to another task". 




4. Select the task that will be linked to the current task. If necessary, use the different filters (contributor, requirement, project, ...) to find the task. 

5. Validate. 

6. In the screen that is displayed, define: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CC_Suivi_Tache2%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)


	- The source and target tasks. They can be reversed if necessary. 

- The type of link. 

- The options. You can: 

	- Use a strict link. In this case, the activation or the ending of the destination is not allowed if the link constraint is not respected. 

	- Send a message when the source task is started or completed (available if the contributors associated with the tasks are different). The message will be sent via the WDBal application (and by email if the option was chosen in the parameters of Project Monitoring Center). 

7. Validate. The link appears in the "Linked tasks" tab of the task description window.

## Multiplication coefficient
<a name="multiplication_coefficient_ELTTEXTE000440"></a>
The intended schedules are often optimistic. In most cases, they do not reflect a set of micro-tasks that are often costly in time. The Project Monitoring Center proposes a "realism" coefficient that can be applied by the administrator in order to get a schedule closer to reality.

A multiplication coefficient can be applied to each contributor. The duration of each task will be automatically multiplied by the specified coefficient. For example, a trainee developer will get a coefficient of 3 while a senior developer will have a coefficient of 2.5, ...

To define the coefficients to apply:

1. Expand ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CC_Suivi_Configuration%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif) and select "Options".

2. Select "Options reserved for administrators".. 

3. Select "Enable the coefficients".

4. Click the "Edit the coefficients".

5. Specify the coefficients for each contributor. A coefficient of 1.5 corresponds to a 50% increase in time.




When the coefficients are enabled, the task list and the schedule reflect these coefficients. To restore a "standard" schedule and task list, all you have to do is uncheck "Enable the coefficients".

**Remark**: The coefficients can be defined by an administrator only.

## Printing the tasks
<a name="printing_the_tasks_ELTTEXTE000464"></a>
The Project Monitoring Center proposes several methods for printing the tasks or the task list. You can:

- Print the task directly, from the task modification screen (![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_Imprimer.gif)).

- Print the list of current tasks. In the ribbon of the "Tasks" tab, click "Print". 

- Print the schedule for the selected contributors. In the ribbon of the "Schedule" tab, click "Print": 

	- Print in schedule format: this option is used to print the schedule displayed in the "Schedule" tab. 

	- Print in list format: is used to print the task list for each project and for each team member. 




- Print the schedule in a Gantt chart. In the "Gantt chart" tab, click the "Print" button. 
	Remark: The "Gantt chart" tab can be displayed via the "Gantt chart" button found in the "Tasks" and "Schedule" tasks.
