## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000307"></a>
Via the Control Centers, WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile include several tools allowing the project manager to manage a development project that includes:

- the definition of the different contributors of the project, 

- the definition of requirements and tasks as well as their assignment to the different contributors, 

- the monitoring of project progress.




**The different steps for managing a development project are as follows**: 

1. [Create and configure the database of the Control Centers (if necessary)](#NOTE2).

2. [Define the contributors](#NOTE3).

3. [Define the requirements](#NOTE4).

4. [Define the WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile projects](#NOTE5).

5. [Define the tasks and associate them with the requirements and with the developers](#NOTE6).

6. [Follow the progress of the project](#NOTE7).

## Step 1: Database of Control Centers
<a name="step_1_database_control_centers_ELTTEXTE000331"></a>
The database of Control Centers groups various information shared by the different modules found in WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile.

Configuring the database of Control Centers consists in indicating the location of this database and the format of the files used. **This step is very important**.

For more details, see [Configuring the database of Control Centers](../CCSuivi/3540720.md).

## Step 2: Defining the contributors
<a name="step_2_defining_the_contributors_ELTTEXTE000355"></a>
To follow the progress of a development project, the contributors of this project must be defined.

The contributors are defined in the Project Monitoring Center. The Project Monitoring Center is used to define all he contributors managed by the Control Centers. Then, the Project Monitoring Center is used to associate the contributors with the different projects managed by the Project Monitoring Center.

Once the contributors have been created in the database of Control Centers, these contributors can use their identifier to start WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile: they will be automatically recognized. They also have the ability to connect to the Project Monitoring Center to configure their schedules and holidays, and to manage their tasks.

### Defining the contributors
<a name="defining_the_contributors_ELTPARAGRAPHE000066"></a>

To define the contributors:

1. Start the Project Monitoring Center from WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile: on the "Tools" tab, in the "Control Centers" group, click "Project Monitoring".

2. Identify yourself to start the Project Monitoring Center with your identifier and password. To create contributors, you must be an administrator. By default, the "Admin" user is automatically created when installing the database of Control Centers.

3. Expand ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CC_Suivi_Configuration%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)
 and select "Contributors".

4. Create the different contributors via the "New contributor" button. For more details, see [Managing contributors](../CCSuivi/3540703.md).




We shall see later (step 4) how the contributors can be associated with the development projects.

## Step 3: Define the requirements
<a name="step_3_define_the_requirements_ELTTEXTE000385"></a>
The requirements are made available to the project manager in order to manage the project development. What is a requirement? A requirement is a need regarding an action that should be performed by a product.

Let's take the case of a WINDEV application: a requirement will correspond to a new feature (ability to display statistics in the sales application for example). This new feature groups several elements:

- One or more development tasks, to include the feature in the application.

- One or more test tasks to run the feature test.

- One or more documentation tasks to document the feature.




This feature (or requirement) can also be linked to one or more business rules or to one or more incidents.

The requirements are created and managed from the Project Monitoring Center. For more details, see [Creating requirements](../CCSuivi/3540717.md).

## Step 4: Defining the WINDEV, WINDEV Mobile or WEBDEV projects
<a name="step_4_defining_the_windev_windev_mobile_webdev_projects_ELTTEXTE000409"></a>
A development project can correspond to one or more WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile projects. These projects must be referenced in the Project Monitoring Center.

To check whether the projects are referenced in the Project Monitoring Center:

1. Start the Project Monitoring Center from WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile: on the "Tools" tab, in the "Control Centers" group, click "Project Monitoring".

2. Check the presence of the development project in the Project Monitoring Center: expand ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CC_Suivi_Configuration%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)
 and select "Projects". Your project can be displayed either in a group of projects, or in the "&lt;Not assigned to a group&gt;" list. You can type the name of the sought project and click the magnifier button.




If the project does not exist, you can:

- Create a new development project. This project can be linked (or not) to a WINDEV project (WDP), to a WEBDEV project (WWP) or to a WINDEV Mobile project (WPP.

- Import one or more WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile projects as development project.




For more details, see [Creating a project in the Project Monitoring Center](../CCSuivi/3540702.md).

### Associating contributors with a development project
<a name="associating_contributors_with_development_project_ELTPARAGRAPHE000153"></a>

The association between the contributors found in the database of Control Centers and a development project can be performed via the Project Monitoring Center.

1. Start the Project Monitoring Center from WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile: on the "Tools" tab, in the "Control Centers" group, click "Project Monitoring".

2. Find your development project: expand ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CC_Suivi_Configuration%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)
 and select "Projects". You can type the name of the sought project and click the magnifier button.

3. Select your development project and click the "Project contributors" button.

4. Associate the contributors or the teams with the current project. You have the ability to specify the role of each contributor or team.




**Remark**: At least one manager must be defined for the project. The manager has full rights on the project, on the contributors and on the tasks associated with the project.

## Step 5: Define the tasks and associate them with the requirements and with the developers
<a name="step_5_define_the_tasks_and_associate_them_with_the_requirements_and_with_the_developers_ELTTEXTE000439"></a>
A requirement corresponding to a feature, it must be associated with the different tasks and with the different contributors used to perform the requirement.

For example, the "Displays the sales statistics" requirement may affect:

- One or more development tasks:

	- The developer X who works on the WINDEV application and who must create the window for displaying the statistics.

	- The developer Y who works on the corresponding WEBDEV site.

	- The developer Z who must develop the process for calculating the statistics.




- A test task to validate the calculation and the display of the statistics.

- A documentation task to display the help corresponding to the statistics displayed.

- A suggestion made by a user to get the statistics.




The association between the tasks and the requirements is performed in the Project Monitoring Center.

### Associating a task with a requirement
<a name="associating_task_with_requirement_ELTPARAGRAPHE000201"></a>

To associate a task with a requirement: 

1. Start the Project Monitoring Center from WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile: on the "Tools" tab, in the "Control Centers" group, click "Project Monitoring".

2. Display or create a "Requirements" tab. 

3. Select the requested requirement. The context menu is used to:

	- link the requirement to a new task or to an existing task.

	- link the requirement to a new incident or to an existing incident.

	- link the requirement to a new business rule or to an existing business rule.







Remark: When creating a task linked to the requirement, don't forget to specify:

- the type of task (development, test or documentation) 

- The contributor, 

- The project associated with the task.




For more details, see [Assigning the requirements](../CCSuivi/3540718.md).

## Step 6: Follow the progress of the project
<a name="step_6_follow_the_progress_the_project_ELTTEXTE000469"></a>
The status progress of a development project made of several requirements can be followed by the Project Monitoring Center.
<a name="NOTE7_2"></a>


### Monitoring a project via the Project Monitoring Center
<a name="monitoring_project_via_the_project_monitoring_center_ELTPARAGRAPHE000246"></a>

The "Requirements" tab gives the manager a global view regarding the progress of a requirement or group of requirements. 

Several filters are used to select the requirements to display. 

The "Display mode" option found in the pane ribbon is used to get: 

- The list of requirements (default display mode). 

- The chart of requirements: Several tables and charts show the number of requirements per department, per contributor, as well as their status.

- The chart of tasks: Several charts are used to display the number of tasks affected by the requirements and their progress.

- The chart of incidents: Several charts are used to display the number of incidents affected by the requirements as well as their progress.

- Project elements: The list of project elements affected by the requirements (elements of a WINDEV project affected by a task or by the business rules for example).




The three "Charts" can be displayed according to different modes (General, Development, Test and Documentation). The Development mode, the Test mode and the Documentation mode are linked to the type of task. The coefficients of complexity can also be taken into account. These coefficients are defined at requirement level for each type of task.
