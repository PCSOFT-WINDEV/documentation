## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000203"></a>
Time management is extremely important. Where is time spent in a day? How to find out without adding constraints, without requiring fastidious time keeping from the team members and without making people feel like somebody is watching over their shoulder?

Entering the time spent on the tasks is an interesting feature of WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile. This feature is linked to the use of the Project Monitoring Center.  

**The principle is straightforward**: the task list is entered in the Project Monitoring Center.

The current task is called back at regular time intervals. The user can validate the current task or change his current task if necessary. Furthermore, a "task wheel" is displayed if the computer is idle for a specified amount of time. This task wheel allows you to select the interrupting task corresponding to the time spent during the display of the wheel.

For more details on managing schedules and tasks, see [Using the task management](../CCSuivi/3540713.md).

## Starting the time management help
<a name="starting_the_time_management_help_ELTTEXTE000227"></a>
The time management is automatically enabled when starting WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile or the Project Monitoring Center. An icon is displayed in the Windows taskbar (beside the clock) when time management is enabled.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Systray.gif)

### Enabling/Disabling time management
<a name="enablingdisabling_time_management_ELTPARAGRAPHE000035"></a>

Time management can be enabled/disabled in the window for configuring the time management. This window can be displayed:

- in the Project Monitoring Center: expand ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CC_Suivi_Configuration%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif), select "Options" and click "Time management help". <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Aide_%E0_la_gestion_du_temps%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif&type=thumb)
You now have the ability to enable time management.

- in the product used (WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile): on the "Project" tab, in the "Other actions" group, expand "Time management" and select "Time management options".


**Remark**: If time management is disabled, the Project Monitoring Center continues to keep track of the amount of time spent on each task. However, you must remember to change the current task in the Project Monitoring Center whenever the task changes.

### Calculating the time spent on a task with time management
<a name="calculating_the_time_spent_task_with_time_management_ELTPARAGRAPHE000063"></a>

If time management is enabled, the mode for calculating the time spent on a task is different.

**If the time management help is enabled**:
The calculation of the time spent on a task takes into account:

- the information specified in the task wheel and in the window for managing the current task. The working hours and the working days specified in the options of Project Monitoring Center are ignored.

- the automatic lock of the current task when closing the Windows session.

- the automatic lock of current task when closing the Project Monitoring Center of WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile.


In this case, the information entered in the schedule configuration is taken into account only when establishing the schedule. The schedule takes into account the time really spent.

**If the time management help is not enabled**: 
The calculation of the time spent on a task only takes into account the working times and the working days specified in the schedule configuration. The "overtime" is not taken into account.

## Window for managing the current task
<a name="window_for_managing_the_current_task_ELTTEXTE000263"></a>
If time management is enabled, the window for managing the current task is displayed at regular time intervals. This window displays a reminder of the current task and it allows you to change task if necessary. By default, this window is displayed:

- every 60 minutes

- after 10 minutes if the computer is idle.




To force the display of this window:

- click the icon found in the taskbar.

- on the "Project" tab, click "Other actions", expand "Time management" and select "Display time management".

This window contains the following elements:

1. Title of the current task. Click this name to specify that this task is still the current task.

2. Date and time of the last activation of the current task and activity duration since this activation. This time takes into account the hours spent on the task outside the times and days specified in the schedule configuration performed in the Project Monitoring Center. For example: let's say your working hours are defined from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM. If you start a task at 4:00 PM and you work until 7:00 PM, the task management window will display 3 hours of work time the next day.

3. Displaying the wheel of interrupting tasks.

4. Allows you to display a context menu in order to change the current task. The history of the task can also be modified.

5. Used to start the Project Monitoring Center directly. 

6. Used to display [the time management help configuration window](../CCSuivi/3540710.md).




**Remark**: This window can be displayed directly from WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile, pressing Ctrl + J.

## Wheel of interrupting tasks
<a name="wheel_interrupting_tasks_ELTTEXTE000287"></a>


### The interrupting tasks
<a name="the_interrupting_tasks_ELTPARAGRAPHE000128"></a>

The interrupting tasks are unscheduled temporary tasks. These tasks correspond to the various events that may occur during a working day and that may interrupt the current task.

These interrupting tasks are personal tasks and they can differ for each contributor. Eight interrupting tasks are proposed by default: Meeting, Phone, Absence, Appointment, Internet and emails, Various, Meal, Break.

These interrupting tasks can be modified:

- in the Project Monitoring Center ("Interrupting tasks" tab).

- in the window for configuring the options for time management.

### The wheel of interrupting tasks

<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Aide_%E0_la_gestion_du_temps%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.gif)
By default, the wheel of interrupting tasks is displayed 10 minutes after the window for managing the current task if no action was performed in this window. This duration can be modified in the window for configuring time management. The computation of idle time displayed in the wheel starts when the window for managing the curent task is displayed or when the idle time starts on the computer.

The wheel of interrupting tasks enables you to select the interrupting task corresponding to the time spent since the wheel was displayed. Indeed, the current task is automatically locked when the wheel is displayed. The idle time is displayed in the center of the wheel.

You can:

- **Click one of the interrupting tasks**. The time passed between the display of the wheel and the click on the task is automatically assigned to the selected interrupting task. The task that was the current task before the display of the wheel is automatically re-enabled.

- **In the center of the wheel**, click the caption of the current task. The time passed during the wheel display is added to the total time spent on the current task.

- **Click "Other tasks"** to select another task. The time passed during the wheel display is counted as part of this other task. The task that was the current task before the display of the wheel is automatically re-enabled.

- **Click "I was away"**. This option is used to specify that the idle time must not be deducted. This option can be used in the morning for example when the computer was not switched off and when the task wheel is displayed.




**Remark**: The function keys are automatically assigned to the different tasks of the wheel. For example, press F1 to select the task number 1.
