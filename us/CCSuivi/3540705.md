## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000161"></a>
The project contributors can manage their tasks directly from the schedule or from the task list.

The schedule presents the different tasks assigned to one or more contributors in a diagram, for all projects. The diagram can be built from an hourly, weekly or daily schedule.

The schedule is displayed by the Project Monitoring Center in a "Schedule" tab. This schedule takes into account the standard tasks displayed in the "Tasks" tabs. 

The "Tasks" tab gives a global vision of the tasks assigned to a contributor for a project.

The "Schedule" tab gives a global vision of the tasks assigned to a contributor as well as the simultaneous tasks assigned to several contributors.

### Durations taken into account by the schedule
<a name="durations_taken_into_account_the_schedule_ELTPARAGRAPHE000051"></a>

The future schedule (for the forthcoming days) takes into account the working hours and the working days entered by each contributor.

The schedule performed (for the previous days) takes into account:

- If time management is enabled, the actual time spent on each task (including the "overtime").

- If time management is not enabled, the working hours and the working days configured in the Project Monitoring Center.

### Overview

The "Tasks" tab allow each contributor to see the tasks assigned to him. In this tab, the contributor can reorganize them by using the arrows found on the right of the task list. The schedule (displayed in the "Schedule" tabs) automatically takes this reorganization into account.

### Managing the current tasks
<a name="managing_the_current_tasks_ELTPARAGRAPHE000072"></a>

The contributor can easily indicate his current task: in a "Tasks" tab, all you have to do is select the task and select "Start this task". The name of the current task is displayed:

- in a tooltip found in the taskbar (above the icon of the Project Monitoring Center).

- in the window for managing tasks if [the time management help](../CCSuivi/3540711.md) is enabled.




The Project Monitoring Center can be minimized ("Minimize" button or Esc key on the keyboard).

**To indicate that the task is completed**, you must: 

- display the Project Monitoring Center, 

- display a "Tasks" tab. 

- select "Perform the task" in the context menu of the task. The time spent on the task is updated.




**If the time management help is enabled**, the calculation of time spent on a task takes into account:

- the information specified in the task wheel and in the window for managing the current task. The working hours and the working days specified in the options of Project Monitoring Center are ignored.

- the automatic lock of the current task when closing the Windows session.

- the automatic lock of current task when closing the Project Monitoring Center of WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile.




**If the time management help is not enabled**, the calculation of the time spent on a task only takes into account the times and days worked specified in the schedule configuration. The "overtime" is not taken into account.
