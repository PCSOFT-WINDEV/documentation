## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000170"></a>
A sprint or iteration is a development cycle. In Agile development (Scrum), a project is divided into a set of sprints. 

Each sprint includes requirements, tasks or incidents to be completed within a given time frame. 

The sprint is finished once all of its items are completed.

3. Specify the characteristics of the new sprint: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=cc_suivi_sprint%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)


	- Sprint name, 

- Goal, 

- Manager, 

- Duration with a start date.

4. Validate. The sprint is created and appears on the left of the window. 




**To associate items to the sprint**: 

1. In the ribbon, in the "Backlog" group, click the type of item you want to add: Requirements, Tasks or Incidents. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=cc_suivi_sprint%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif)
