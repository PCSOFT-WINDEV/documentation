## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000163"></a>
The Project Monitoring Center is used to define **spools of requests**. A spool of requests corresponds to a list of requests not associated with projects. These requests can be incidents or suggestions sent by the users of the application.

Usage example of a spool of requests: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=CCSuivi_spool.gif)


The requests are created by different methods:

- the "Feedback" component provided with WINDEV. The end users send their requests.

- the Project Monitoring Center: you have the ability to create a new request and to assign it to a spool.




**Remark**: A [working project](../CCSuivi/3540702.md) and a spool of requests are automatically created when the "Suggestions, problems..." option of the [? menu](../Editeurs/9000070.md) is included in the WINDEV application. This working project and this spool of requests are automatically associated with the WINDEV application.
