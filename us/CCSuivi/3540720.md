## How to create the database of Control Centers?
<a name="how_create_the_database_control_centers_ELTTEXTE000220"></a>


### Setup
<a name="setup_ELTPARAGRAPHE000022"></a>

When installing WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile, the setup program proposes to:

- create the database of the Control Centers. By default, this database will be created in the specified directory (in the "\\Personal\\Control Centers" subdirectory) when WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile is started for the first time. This database will be in HFSQL Classic format by default.

- share an existing database of the Control Centers.




If you have chosen the default parameters, the database of Control Centers is created locally when WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile is started for the first time.

### Working alone or as part of a team

**If you are working on your own**, you can keep the database of Control Centers locally. However, if you use several products, it is recommended to share this local database between the different products.

**If you are working in team**, we advise you to share the database of Control Centers. You can:

- use a shared HFSQL Classic database.

- use an HFSQL Client/Server database.




The type of database is configured in the options of WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile: 

- on the "Home" tab, in the "Environment" group, expand "Options" and select "General options of WINDEV/WEBDEV/WINDEV Mobile". 

- in the "User" tab, click "Parameters of the Control Centers".

### Shared HFSQL Classic database
<a name="shared_hfsql_classic_database_ELTPARAGRAPHE000067"></a>

**To use a shared HFSQL Classic database,** you must:

- Create a shared directory accessible by all the developers. This directory must be accessible in read/write for all the contributors.

- Specify the path of this directory in the options for configuring the Control Centers. All the developers belonging to the team must have the same configuration.




**Reminder**: The type of database is configured in the options of WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile: 

- on the "Home" tab, in the "Environment" group, expand "Options" and select "General options of WINDEV/WEBDEV/WINDEV Mobile". 

- in the "User" tab, click "Parameters of the Control Centers".




The database will be automatically created during the first use. The different contributors will have to re-enter their login and password if necessary.

Remark: The information entered by the different developers in the Control Centers used locally cannot be retrieved.

### HFSQL Client/Server database
<a name="hfsql_clientserver_database_ELTPARAGRAPHE000102"></a>

**To use an HFSQL Client/Server database**, you must:

- Install an HFSQL Client/Server server.
	To install HFSQL Client/Server, start your product setup package and click "Setup of HFSQL Client/Server".
	**Remark**: In WINDEV, the setup program of an HFSQL Client/Server server is available in the "\\Install\\HFSQL server" subdirectory of the setup directory of your product.

- Specify the characteristics of the database in the options for configuring the Control Centers:

	- the server name or IP address.

	- the name of the HFSQL Client/Server database to use. This database must be empty (without files) or not found (in this case, it will be automatically created).

	- the port that will be used for the connection.







All the developers belonging to the team must have the same configuration.

**Reminder**: The type of database is configured in the options of WINDEV, WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile: 

- on the "Home" tab, in the "Environment" group, expand "Options" and select "General options of WINDEV/WEBDEV/WINDEV Mobile". 

- in the "User" tab, click "Parameters of the Control Centers".




**Remark**: If you are using a shared HFSQL Classic database, this database can be migrated to HFSQL Client/Server. For more details, see [Using the database of Control Centers in Client/Server mode](../CCSuivi/3540712.md).
