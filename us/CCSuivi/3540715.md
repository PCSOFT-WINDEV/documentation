## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000110"></a>
When using a database, you may have to perform maintenance operations on the data files. These operations are used to optimize the access time to data or to free the locked transactions for example.

**When should these options be used?**
When a technical problem occurs (power outage, etc.), when starting the Control Centers, a message can propose to cancel the locked transactions or to perform a re-index operation.
Remark: If the database of the Control Centers is quite important, a re-index operation should be performed on a regular basis.

**Caution: These operations are locking operations: the data from the Control Centers cannot be accessed during the operation**.
