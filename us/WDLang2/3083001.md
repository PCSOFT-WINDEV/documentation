## Syntax

`LooperDisplay(<Looper control> [, <Position>])`
---

**`<Looper control>: (Control name)`**

Name of the Looper control to refresh.
If this parameter corresponds to an empty string (""), the Looper control to which the current event belongs is refreshed.

**`<Position>: (Integer, character or constant (optional))`**

Indicates the start position for the refresh. If this parameter is not specified, the elements of the Looper control are redisplayed from the current element in the Looper control.

This parameter can correspond to:

- An integer. The refresh is performed from this position. The selected row is not modified. The "Select a row" event of &lt;Position&gt; is run. The current element in the Looper control is the same as the current record in the data file. If this integer is invalid (outside the authorized bounds), the call to **LooperDisplay** triggers an error.

- A character or a constant:

| --- | --- |
| *taCurrentFirst* | <br><br>	- Refreshes the Looper control from the current record in the data file.<br><br>	- The first row of the Looper control is selected. This row corresponds to the current record of the Looper control.<br><br><br> |
| *taCurrentSelection* | <br><br>	- Refreshes the Looper control from the position of selection bar in the Looper control.<br><br>	- The position of selection bar is not modified. The current record in the data file will correspond to the record selected in the Looper control (after **LooperDisplay** is called).<br><br><br> |
| *taInit* | <br><br>	- Runs the initialization and end of initialization codes of the Looper control.<br><br>	- Fills the Looper control.<br><br>	- The first row of the Looper control is selected. This row corresponds to the current record at the end of initialization code of the Looper control.<br><br><br> |
| *taNext* | <br><br>	- Redisplays the Looper control and point at the beginning of the Looper control on the next page (same as using the pager to access the next page).<br><br>	- The first visible row of the Looper control is selected.

| *taReExecuteQuery* | <br><br>	- Re-execute the query linked to the Looper control. For more details, see [Tables and queries](../WDChamp/1013203.md).<br><br>	- Refreshes the Looper control and sets the position at the beginning of the control.<br><br>	- The first row of the Looper control is selected. This row corresponds to the first record of the Looper control.<br><br><br>**Caution**: Only the query linked to the Looper control is run. If specific options have been specified with [HExecuteQuery](../WDLang4/3044080.md) (*hModifyFile*, for example), these options are ignored. |
| *taStart*<br>(Default value) | <br><br>	- Refreshes the Looper control and sets the position at the beginning of the control.<br><br>	- The first row of the Looper control is selected. This row corresponds to the first record of the Looper control.<br>		Remark: For a Looper control populated programmatically, the first element is not selected. <br><br><br> |
