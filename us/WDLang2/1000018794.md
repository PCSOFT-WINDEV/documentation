<a name="Example2"></a>

```wl
// -- Event "Progress of transfer"
// Displays the number of bytes sent according to the total size to send
STC_UploadMulti_Global = Round(UploadSizeSent(MySelf) / UploadSize(MySelf) * 100) + "%"

## Remarks


### In which event should I use this function?
<a name="which_event_should_use_this_function_ELTPARAGRAPHE000059"></a>

**UploadSizeSent** can only be used in the browser event "Progress of transfer". This event is associated: 

- to the "Send" button for a single-file Upload control. 

- to the "Add" button for a multi-file Upload control.


Used in another event, **UploadSizeSent** will return 0.

### Maximum size of files to upload
<a name="maximum_size_files_upload_ELTPARAGRAPHE000206"></a>

**By default,** the size of files to upload is not limited in the WEBDEV engine. This size can be limited by the WEBDEV Application Server. 
The file will not be uploaded if its size exceeds the limit size.
To modify the maximum size of files to upload in WEBDEV application server, the registry must be modified on the server:  

1. To modify the size of the uploaded files for all the WEBDEV 28 applications, select the following key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\PC SOFT\\WEBDEV\\28.0 on a 32-bit computer and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\PC SOFT\\WEBDEV\\28.0 on a 64-bit computer.

2. Add the MAX_UPLOAD string. The value of this string will be the maximum size of files to upload (in KB).
