Configures the operating mode of the AWP context. 

For more details on the available modes, see [Managing AWP contexts](../WDChamp/3539060.md).

**Caution**: This function requires a good knowledge of WEBDEV.

## Syntax

`ConfigureAWPContext(<Content storage mode> [, <Identifier transmission mode>])`
---

**`<Content storage mode>: (Integer constant)`**

Mode for storing the content of the context:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *ctxCookie* | The content is transmitted in a cookie (behavior compatible with version 11).<br><br>**Caution**: This constant must not be used to store sensitive data. Indeed, this information is stored "without being encrypted". |
| *ctxDisk* | The content of the context is saved in a file on the server. |



**`<Identifier transmission mode>: (Integer constant (optional))`**

Define the transmission mode of identifier (taken into account only if &lt;Content storage mode&gt; corresponds to the *ctxDisk* constant):


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *ctxIDCookie* | The identifier is transmitted by a cookie. |
| *ctxIDCookieURL*<br>(default value) | The identifier is transmitted by cookies. If the cookies do not operate, the identifier is transmitted by the URL. When creating the context, the two modes are used because it is not possible to know whether the cookies will be accepted or not. |
| *ctxIDUrl* | The identifier is transmitted by the URL. |

## Remarks


- It is recommended to use **ConfigureAWPContext** in the "Initializing" event of the project. Indeed, this mode cannot be modified once the session was started.

- **ConfigureAWPContext** is taken into account in AWP mode only.

- If **ConfigureAWPContext** is not called, contexts are managed via cookies by default. 

- **Reminder**: The initialization process of project is run whenever an Active WEBDEV Page is displayed.

- If your project uses pre-launched sessions, this function must not be used in the project initialization event. This function must be used in the "Initializing the project after connection to the site" event. 

- For more details, see [The dynamic Active WEBDEV Pages](../WDChamp/3539009.md).
