## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

`JSInterruptEvent(<Event> [, <Options>])`
---

**`<Event>: (Character string)`**

Current event that must be interrupted.
This is the parameter received by the procedure (for more details, see [JSEvent](../WDLang2/1000018924.md) ).

**`<Options>: (Optional combination of Integer constants)`**

Indicates the interruption level.
If no constant is specified, the current procedure is interrupted.

The possible constants are:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *jsInterruptEventAction* | The browser action associated with the event is canceled in addition to the interruption of current procedure. For example, if the current event is a click in a check box, changing the status of check box is canceled. |
| *jsInterruptEventPropagation* | The propagation of the event is interrupted in addition to the interruption of current procedure. If other procedures are associated with the same event on the same object, these procedures will still be called. |
