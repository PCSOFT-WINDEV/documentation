Displays a page in modal mode. This function is used to establish a dialog with the user. The page is displayed in the foreground while the opening page is displayed in the background, grayed by the DDW mechanism. For more details, see "Resulting display". 

The code of the page is locked until the page is closed by [PageCloseDialog](../WDLang2/1000017166.md). The page can return a value.

- by the [PageCloseDialog](../WDLang2/1000017166.md) function,

- by the [ReturnedValue](../Proprietes/2510134.md) property used before closing the page,

&lt;Result&gt; corresponds to <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> and an error is displayed if the user presses the browser "Back" button.

**`<Page>: (Page name)`**

Name of the page to open. This page must be a non-AWP dynamic page that does not use AJAX code.

## Remarks


### Resulting display
<a name="resulting_display_ELTPARAGRAPHE000105"></a>

The display is as follows: the page displayed by **PageDisplayDialog** is displayed in the foreground.

Only the border and the content of the page are displayed: This page has no title bar, no taskbar, ... Regardless of its color, the page background is ignored.

The page that used **PageDisplayDialog** is in the background. This page is grayed by DDW (Dim Disabled Pages). The DDW feature can be configured by [PageActivateDDW](../WDLang2/1000017087.md) and [PageRateDDW](../WDLang2/1000017086.md).

**Remark**: The opened page is not automatically centered: the display mode of the page must be defined in in its characteristics. We advise you to include a large part of the page in a cell with a background color in order to avoid the display effects caused by the DDW feature.


### Limitations
<a name="limitations_ELTPARAGRAPHE000128"></a>

- The page displayed must be a non-AWP dynamic page. 

- **PageDisplayDialog** must be used in a non-AWP dynamic page. 

- If your project uses pre-launched sessions, this function must not be used in the project initialization event. This function must be used in the "Initializing the project after connection to the site" event.
