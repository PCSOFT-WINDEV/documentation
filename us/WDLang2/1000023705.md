Caution: in this case, the former versions of Excel must be equipped with the "Compatibility Pack Office 2007" that can be freely downloaded from the Microsoft site in order to open the generated documents.

- Only the first 256 characters of each control are exported.

- The created file can be opened by Excel 97 (or later) or by OpenOffice Calc 2 (or later).
