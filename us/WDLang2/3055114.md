Runs a server procedure without refreshing the page. This function is locking. No process will be run as long as the procedure result run is not retrieved.

To avoid locking the processes, use [AJAXExecuteAsynchronous](../WDLang2/3055115.md).

## Example
<a class="notetitle" target="_blank" href="$DOC$=3055118&name=ajaxexecute_function&product=WD">See additional examples</a>

```wl
// Is AJAX supported by the current browser?
IF AJAXAvailable() = True THEN
	// Run the server procedure named "MyProc"
	Res is string
	Res = AJAXExecute(MyProc, ProductID, CustomerCity)
	// Use the data to modify 
	...
ELSE
	// Processes without using AJAX 
	... 
END
```

```wl
// -- MyProc server procedure // --
// Procedure used to find the data to be modified in the page 
PROCEDURE MyProc(ProductRef, CCity)
// Find data to be modified
...
// Return the result
RESULT Result1

## Syntax

`<Result> = AJAXExecute([<Options>, ] <WLanguage procedure> [, <Parameter 1> [... [, <Parameter N>]]])`
---

**`<Result>: (Character string)`**

Result of the &lt;WLanguage procedure&gt;. This result contains the data to modify in the page.

**`<Options>: (Integer constant (or combination of constants))`**

Update mode: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *ajaxPostValueOfControls* | The values of all the controls of the page must be sent to the server. The WLanguage procedure called will use the values of the controls that contain data entered by the user. |
| *ajaxStraightCall*<br>(default value) | Modified controls are not refreshed in the page. |
| *ajaxSynchronizeServerVariables* | The Ajax call will send variables with the &lt;Browser synchronized&gt; attribute. |
| *ajaxUpdateControls* | Modified controls are automatically refreshed in the page. |
| *ajaxWithoutLockingAWPContext* | The Ajax call will not use the AWP context. Therefore, this context will not be locked. Used to parallelize the Ajax calls on the server. <br><br>Caution: This constant has no effect in page or project GO. |


Caution: these constants must be used directly (no variable can be used to store their value). 

**`<WLanguage procedure>: (Procedure name)`**

Name of server procedure to run (global or local procedure). This procedure is used to find the data to be modified in the page.
The result of this procedure must be a character string returned to the browser by the [RETURN](../Motscles/1510007.md) keyword. For more details, see [the remarks](#NOTE0_1).
This procedure must be allowed to be called by AJAX (see the Notes).

**`<Parameter 1>: (Optional character string)`**

First parameter passed to &lt;Procedure name&gt;.
Caution: Only simple types can be used (character string, integer, etc.). Structured types cannot be used.



**`<Parameter N>: (Optional character string)`**

Nth parameter passed to &lt;Procedure name&gt;.
Caution: Only simple types can be used (character string, integer, etc.). Structured types cannot be used.

## Remarks




### Result of the server procedure
<a name="result_the_server_procedure_ELTPARAGRAPHE000095"></a>

&lt;WLanguage procedure&gt; is used to search for data to modify in the page. The result of this procedure corresponds to the data to modify.

To send this result back to the browser, use the [RETURN](../Motscles/1510007.md) keyword and specify:

- the character string that contains the data.

- the name of the XML document that contains the data.




This result will be automatically contained in the &lt;Result&gt; parameter of **AJAXExecute**. Then, this result must be managed to refresh the data to modify.

If this result corresponds to the name of an XML document, this document will be automatically transmitted and created on the browser. Then, this document can be handled by the [XML functions](../WDLang5/3081005.md).

**Remark**: When using an XML document:

- the XML document is not automatically deleted from the server when it is transmitted to the browser.

- if an XML document with the same name is already found on the browser, the new XML document automatically replaces the former one.

### Procedures that can be called by AJAX
<a name="procedures_that_can_called_ajax_ELTPARAGRAPHE000124"></a>

To secure the WEBDEV sites, the server procedures are protected from illegal calls (attempt to re-route a session for example). To run a server procedure from a browser process (**AJAXExecute** or [AJAXExecuteAsynchronous](../WDLang2/3055115.md)), you must allow this procedure to be called by AJAX.

To allow a server procedure to be called by AJAX, click "AJAX" in the procedure bar:

### Older browsers
<a name="older_browsers_ELTPARAGRAPHE000148"></a>

[AJAXAvailable](../WDLang2/3055112.md) is used to determine if the current browser supports AJAX technology. If a process that uses AJAX is run on a browser that does not support this technology, the process is run "as if" it did not use AJAX (e.g., the entire page is refreshed).
