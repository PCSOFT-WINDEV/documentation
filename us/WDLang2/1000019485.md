## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000211"></a>
A pre-launched session is a session of a Web site (or webservice) automatically started on the Web server from the WEBDEV Application Server. 

Pre-launched sessions are used to speed up the display of pages by performing long processes in advance: connecting to databases, loading page configurations, etc.

Pre-launched sessions can be used with WEBDEV sites in Session and AWP modes and with SOAP and REST webservices. This operating mode is identical in any case. 

**Remark**: Pre-launched sessions are allowed on the unlimited server or on the 10-connection server. They are not enabled on the development computer.

## Importance of pre-launched sessions

### Principle of a request for displaying an Active WEBDEV Page
<a name="principle_request_for_displaying_active_webdev_page_ELTPARAGRAPHE000024"></a>

To understand the importance of pre-launched sessions (especially for Active WEBDEV Pages), let's take a look at the principle of Active WEBDEV Pages.

When a Web user performs a request from an AWP page, the following operations are performed: 

1. The request is transmitted from the browser to the Web server. 

2. The Web server studies the request. 

3. The Web server transmits the request to the WEBDEV application server. 

4. The WEBDEV Application Server: 

	- loads the project corresponding to the page. 

	- runs the project initialization code, then the page code. 

	- returns the response to the Web server. 




5. The Web server returns the response to the browser. 





### Benefit of pre-launched sessions
<a name="benefit_prelaunched_sessions_ELTPARAGRAPHE000041"></a>

When displaying an Active WEBDEV Page, each call to the WEBDEV Application Server is entirely independent. 

**Consequence**: For each request (and therefore for each change of page, for each Ajax call), the WEBDEV Application Server re-loads the project and re-runs the initialization code. The project initialization code often runs "long" operations: 

- connecting to the database,

- loading configuration files,

- ...




The pre-launched sessions ask the WEBDEV Application Server to perform these operations in advance. 

Therefore, when the request of the Web user reaches the WEBDEV Application Server, the application server only has to run the request and to return the result. 

Using pre-launched sessions results in shorter response times, since part of the code is executed in advance. However, pre-launched sessions do not reduce server load (the code is still executed) and do not replace the optimization of initialization code.

## Implementation
<a name="implementation_ELTTEXTE000265"></a>


### Steps to follow
<a name="steps_follow_ELTPARAGRAPHE000062"></a>

To implement pre-launched sessions in a WEBDEV project: 

1. Enable the detection of errors specific to pre-launched sessions. 

2. Correct the errors by using the "Initialize project after connecting to the site" event. 

3. Enable pre-launched sessions on the WEBDEV Application Server. 



<a name="NOTE3_2"></a>


### Enabling the detection of errors specific to pre-launched sessions
<a name="enabling_the_detection_errors_specific_prelaunched_sessions_ELTPARAGRAPHE000073"></a>

If your project uses pre-launched sessions, some functions can no longer be used when initializing the project. 

To know potential problems that may occur when using pre-launched sessions, simply enable the mode for detecting the errors specific to pre-launched sessions: 

1. Display the "Compilation errors" pane if necessary: on the "Home" tab, in the "Environment" group, expand "Panes", select "Panes", and then select "Compilation errors". 

2. In the pane of compilation errors, click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ico_ErreurSession.gif). 

3. The list of errors is displayed. 




Remark: The detection of errors can also be enabled from the description window of the current configuration: 

1. On the "Project" tab, in the "Project configuration" group, click "Current configuration". 

2. In the "Compatibility" tab, check "Display compilation errors specific to pre-launched sessions". 

3. Validate. 

4. The list of errors is displayed in the error pane.

### Correcting errors specific to pre-launched sessions
<a name="correcting_errors_specific_prelaunched_sessions_ELTPARAGRAPHE000123"></a>

To manage pre-launched sessions, two events are associated with the project: 

- "Initialization", a project event run before the request reaches the WEBDEV Application Server. This code is run when starting the pre-launched session. 

- "Initialize project after connecting to the site", run when the WEBDEV Application Server processes the request. 




To correct the errors specific to the pre-launched sessions, simply move the corresponding code into the "Initialize project after connecting to the site" event. 

When the site is compatible with the mechanism of pre-launched sessions, you can deploy it and enable the pre-launched sessions on the WEBDEV Application Server.

### Enabling pre-launched sessions on the server
<a name="enabling_prelaunched_sessions_the_server_ELTPARAGRAPHE000142"></a>

To enable pre-launched sessions for a site: 

1. Start the WEBDEV administrator. 

2. Display the "Configuration" tab. 

3. Check "Allow pre-launched sessions.". By default, all the sites and webservices have 0 pre-launched sessions. 

4. Select the site or the webservice to configure ("Sites" tab ot "Webservice" tab). 

5. In the site parameters ("Sites" tab, "Parameters") or Webservice ("Webservices" tab, "Parameters"), specify the number of pre-launched sessions to use. 

6. Validate. 




Remarks: 

- Pre-launched sessions are counted in the total number of connections to the site (or to the Webservice). This information must be taken into account when configuring the WEBDEV Application Server. 

- The number of pre-launched sessions to be defined depends on the server usage and the number of requests.

	- When a user logs in (sites in Session mode) or displays a page (AWP sites), the WEBDEV Application Server uses a pre-launched session of this application, if any. Otherwise, the WEBDEV Application Server launches a normal session, as if the site didn't have any pre-launched sessions.

	- The number of available pre-launched sessions is checked every second, per site. Therefore, the number of pre-launched sessions depends on the number of connections (Session mode) or the number of times a page is displayed (AWP sites) per second.

	- You must be aware of the time it takes to launch the pre-launched sessions: if it takes takes more than one second to (pre) launch a session, the number of available pre-launched sessions decreases.
