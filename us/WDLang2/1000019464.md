## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000076"></a>
In a Web site, the local storage is used to store and retrieve values in browser code.

These values can be: 

- shared by all the windows and tabs of the same browser on a computer: therefore, they can be retrieved once the browser was closed then reopened or in another window of the browser. **In this case, the local storage is persistent.** 

- specific to a window or to a tab of the browser: in this case, the values will be lost when the browser window is closed. On the contrary, these values can be read by the browser windows opened from the window where the values have been stored. **In this case, the local storage is not persistent.**




**Remarks**: 

- The storage of local parameters is not available by page. 

- The storage of local parameters is available for the recent browsers only (supporting the HTML 5 standard).

- Even for the persistent local storage, the storage is not shared by the different browsers (a value stored in Internet Explorer cannot be retrieved by Firefox).
