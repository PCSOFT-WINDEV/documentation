Displays a Popup control  in a page with a DDW effect (Dim Disabled Windows). This function is used to easily simulate a dialog box in browser code, by using a Popup control of the page.

**Remark**: To display a Popup control, **&lt;Popup&gt;.Display** can be used: 

- in the code of a Button control with the option "Run browser click code only". In this case, only the browser code of the Button control will be executed. 

- in a Button control with the option "Run server and browser codes" (that sends values to the server). AJAX must be enabled in the code of this Button control. In this case, the browser code and server codes of the control will be executed.

| *popupFixed* | The Popup control is pinned at the specified position: the position of the Popup control will not change if the page is scrolled or if the browser size is modified. <br>This constant can be combined with another position constant of the Popup control (excluding popupPositionXY and popupMouseXY). |
| *popupMouseXY* | The Popup control will be opened at the position of the mouse. This constant can only be used in a browser event (of a control or page). This constant cannot be used:<br><br>- in browser procedures.<br><br>- in the events directly or indirectly called from a browser procedure (via [ExecuteProcess](../WDLang1/3013031.md) for example).<br><br>- in the browser code of a Button or Link control.<br><br><br> |

## Remarks


- The Popup control displayed can be hidden with [&lt;Popup&gt;.Close](../WDLang2/1000021656.md).

- The browsers do not refresh the display in the middle of a JavaScript code: **&lt;Popup&gt;.Display** and [&lt;Popup&gt;.Close](../WDLang2/1000021656.md) must be used in different events/processes. If these functions are used in the same event/process, the Popup control is not displayed.

- Two different Popup or Cell controls cannot be displayed at the same time by **&lt;Popup&gt;.Display** or [&lt;Cell&gt;.DisplayDialog](../WDLang2/1000021652.md).

- The DDW (Dim Disabled Windows) can be disabled and customized:

	- from the description window of a page.

	- through programming with [PageActivateDDW](../WDLang2/1000017087.md) and [PageRateDDW](../WDLang2/1000017086.md).
