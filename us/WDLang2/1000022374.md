## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000221"></a>
Google Analytics is a very popular tool for measuring site traffic.

Google Analytics is used to measure the number of views for each site page, the load time of each page, the navigation path, the load time of page resources (images), the rebound rate, the environment of Web user (device, geographical location, language, browser, ...), the source of navigation (home page, ad, ...), etc.

WEBDEV automatically includes in your sites the trackers required to collect statistics in Google Analytics: you will know everything about the activities of Web users on your sites!

If necessary, you have the ability to include additional trackers in your sites, to manage special cases: 

- dowloading a file,

- using planes, ...




This documentation page presents: 

- [How to use Google Analytics in your WEBDEV sites](#NOTE2_1). 

- [The available additional trackers (and the associated functions)](#NOTE3_1). 




Remark: The pages taken into account by Google Analytics are the referenceables pages, which means the static pages, the Active WEBDEV Pages and the PHP pages.

	 On July 1, 2023, Google Analytics is moving from Universal Analytics to Google Analytics 4. WEBDEV 28 supports both versions. The WLanguage functions have been adapted. For existing projects, mode by Default corresponds to Universal Analytics by Default. For new projects, the mode by Default corresponds to Google Analytics 4. 
This Page help file describes the various operations to be carried out.
To modify your accounts and projects on Google Analytics, consult [https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10759417?hl=fr](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10759417?hl=fr)
