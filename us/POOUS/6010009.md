## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000105"></a>
The object-oriented programming (called "OOP") is a programming paradigm in which the programs are organized as sets of objects. Each object represents an instance of a given class, all the classes being members of a class hierarchy unified by inheritance releationships.

Therefore, objects are used by the OOP.

- Each object is an instance of a given class.

- The classes are linked between themselves by the inheritance relationships.

## WLanguage and OOP
<a name="wlanguage_and_oop_ELTTEXTE000129"></a>
The WLanguage is object-oriented:

- it supports the objects

- the objects have an associated class

- the classes can inherit attributes coming from "super classes"




Important: The purpose of this chapter is not to describe OOP concepts, but only to describe how to declare classes, methods and objects in WLanguage. This chapter presents the OOP syntax of WLanguage and the principle for creating an object-oriented program in WLanguage.

We assume that readers are familiar with the concept of classes, objects and inheritances, ...

If you are not familiar with OOP, we recommend that you read an OOP guide before you continue with the rest of this documentation.

This example presents the operating mode of:<br>- classes, <br>- inheritances,<br>- virtual procedures,<br>- UML diagrams,<br>- ...

This example is based on an object-oriented programming concept: the polymorphism. It consists in using different objects (OpenOffice object and Microsoft Word object) without really knowing which one is used.

The software used is not "Outlook express". <br><br>"WD Controlling Outlook" also presents an example for using the WINDEV databinding between the variables found in the code and in the controls.<br><br>This example also presents the OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) and the UML diagrams.
