## Class
<a name="class_ELTTEXTE000153"></a>
A class contains the description of a data structure (members) and the processes (methods) that handle this structure.

Therefore, a class defines a type of data and its behavior.

For more details, see [The classes](../POO/6010006.md).

## Object
<a name="object_ELTTEXTE000177"></a>
A class is used to create objects. Each created object owns the members described in its class and can be manipulated via the methods of its class. An object is defined as "an instance of the class".

A class can be considered as being a model that defines the members and methods common to several objects.

A member is a parameter of the object. A method is used to act on the object, to modify its members for example.

## Constructor and destructor
<a name="constructor_and_destructor_ELTTEXTE000201"></a>
The notion of Constructor and Destructor is important because it involves an automatic call to a method when creating or destroying an object.

- **The Constructor method** associated with a class is automatically called when declaring an object of the class. This is used to make sure that the initialization processes of the object (assignment of members for example) will not be forgotten by the developer.

- <strong><strong><strong><strong>The Destructor method</strong></strong></strong></strong> associated with a class is automatically called when deleting the object (exit from the procedure where the object was declared). This allows you to free the resources used by the object without fear of oversight (memory area for example). It can also be used to update a file related to the object.




For more details, see [Constructor and Destructor](../POO/6010001.md).

## Inheritance
<a name="inheritance_ELTTEXTE000225"></a>
The inheritance is used to include the characteristics of an existing class (base class) into a new class (derived class). This allows you to create a new type of data from a known type, in order to add features or to modify its behavior. Therefore, the base class will not be modified. A class can inherit from one or more classes; it becomes a sub-class of this class.

A derived class inherits the members and methods of its parent classes, in addition to its own members and methods. There is no need to duplicate the members and method of the parent classes.

For more details, see [Class inheritance](../POO/6010007.md).

## Data encapsulation
<a name="data_encapsulation_ELTTEXTE000249"></a>
The data encapsulation is probably the most important notion in OOP. This technique is used to ensure that the data members of the object will not be wrongly modified by some functions (methods) external to the object. This allows you to prevent the user of an object from accessing some or all of its members. The members whose access is forbidden are called private members.

They can only be accessed from some specific methods of the class.

This example presents the operating mode of:<br>- classes, <br>- inheritances,<br>- virtual procedures,<br>- UML diagrams,<br>- ...
- ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WDControllingwordprocessor.gif) ***Training (WINDEV)*** : **WD Controlling word processor** <br>The purpose of this example is to propose a universal interface, allowing to control these applications without having to worry about the application to control. This example is based on an object-oriented programming concept: the polymorphism. It consists in using different objects (OpenOffice object and Microsoft Word object) without really knowing which one is used.
