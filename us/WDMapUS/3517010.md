WDMAP allows you to export records to:

- an Excel file. The records will be available to be used by Excel (statistics, calculations, ...).

- an XML file. Then, the records can be displayed in an Internet page.

- a text file.




The exported records correspond to the ones viewed in WDMap. To export a selection of records, all you have to do is [select the records viewed](../WDMap/3517011.md).
