## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000301"></a>
From the monitor, you can change the configuration options:

- of the robot,

- of the counter-robot,

- of the monitor.

## Configuring the robot parameters
<a name="configuring_the_robot_parameters_ELTTEXTE000325"></a>
The robot parameters correspondent to the parameters specified in the wizard for configuring the robot.

**To display the robot parameters**: 

1. In the menu, go to the "Settings" group, select "Configure" and then "Parameters of the monitoring robot".

2. A window shows the characteristics of the robot:

	- Name, computer, access directory.

	- Alert options. These options can be configured for: 

		- alert via WDBal,

		- alert via Email,

		- alert via third-party program,


 You can configure the reports sent via Email or WDBal.

## Alert options
<a name="alert_options_ELTTEXTE000349"></a>


### Alert by WDBal
<a name="alert_wdbal_ELTPARAGRAPHE000042"></a>

The "WDBal" tab is used to configure the sending of error reports via the PC SOFT messaging named WDBal. To use this mode of alert message, the database of Control Centers must be accessible from the computer where the robot is installed.
<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Param_robot%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif)


If the option for sending messages via WDBal is enabled ("Send via WDBal enabled" option checked), this alert mode will be used by default for all the checks in the monitor. Each user can then define specific parameters

The "Configuring WDBal" section is used to define the access mode to the data of Control Centers:

- In network share mode: directory of the data files.

- In HFSQL Client/Server mode: server used, port and database, as well as user and password. 



<a name="NOTE3_2"></a>


### Alert by email
<a name="alert_email_ELTPARAGRAPHE000062"></a>

The "Email" tab is used to configure the sending of error reports by email. To use this mode of alert message, an SMTP server must be accessible from the computer where the robot is installed.
<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Param_robot%20-%20HC%20N%B0002.gif)


If the option for sending messages via email is enabled ("Send via email enabled" option checked), this alert mode will be used by default for all the checks in the monitor. Each user can then define specific parameters

The "Email settings" section allows you to define the characteristics of the SMTP server used:

- SMTP server and port. 

- User and associated password to use the SMTP server.

- Security used. 



<a name="NOTE3_3"></a>


### Using a specific program
<a name="using_specific_program_ELTPARAGRAPHE000083"></a>

The "Other program" tab allows you to: 

- configure the error report to be sent to a specific program. This third-party program will handle the alert messages. 
	To use this mode of alert message, specify the path of the desired executable. This executable must be accessible from the setup computer of the robot. 

- specify a Webhook. The webhook will be called after each test execution, by passing a JSON file as parameter. 
	To use a webhook, just specify the URL of the webhook to call. 



<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Param_robot%20-%20HC%20N%B0003.gif)


**Send the error report to a third-party program**
In this mode, the error report is an XML file. The path of the error report will be passed in command line to the specific program and it will have to be processed by this program.

The format of the XML file is as follows: 

```xml
<Test>
<TestNumber>%1</TestNumber>
<TestName>%2</TestName>
<TestCategory>%3</TestCategory>
<TestPriority>%4</TestPriority>
<TestSyntax>
%5
</TestSyntax>
<TestSolution>
%6
</TestSolution>
<ErrorDate>%7</ErrorDate>
<ErrorTime>%8</ErrorTime>
<CustomErrorMessage>
%9
</CustomErrorMessage>
<ErrorMessage>
%10
</ErrorMessage>
</Test>
<Test>
...
</Test>
```

In this code:

- %1 = Number identifying the test

- %2 = Name of the test

- %3 = Name of the test category

- %4 = Priority of the test

- %5 = Syntax of the test (associated parameters)

- %6 = Solution proposed for the test

- %7 = Date of the error

- %8 = Time of the error

- %9 = Error message specified in the form of the test

- %10 = Error message returned by the robot




If the option for sending messages via another program is enabled ("Send via another program enabled" option checked), this alert mode will be used by default for all the checks in the monitor.

**Webhook call**
The call will be made after each executed test, passing a JSON file as parameter. 

The JSON file has the following format: 


```txt
{
  "RobotName": "Robot name",
  "ControlName": "Name of the check",
  "ControlCategory": "Category name",
  "Severity": "Error severity level"
  "ResponsibleList": "Supervisor",
  "FirstError": "DateTime of the first error",
  "ErrorMessage": "Error message",
  "IsError": 0/1
  "CustomError": "Custom message"
}
```


The elements in the JSON file are:

- RobotName: name of the monitoring robot (useful if you have multiple robots in your organization and if you want to direct them all to the same webhook).

- ControlName: name (caption) of the check.

- ControlCategory: name (caption) of the check category.

- Severity: level of severity of the check. In version 26, this parameter is always set to "Error".

- ResponsibleList: list of users who receive alerts about this check.

- FirstError: date and time of the first reported error. This member can be used to determine how much time has passed since an error was detected in a given check.

- IsError: boolean indicating if the check contains errors.

- ErrorMessage: error message of the check.

- CustomError: additional error message (specified in the check settings, from the robot monitor).




Remark: If you want to make a webhook call in WEBDEV: 

1. Create a WEBDEV project with a blank Active WEBDEV Page. 

2. In the Active WEBDEV Page: 

	- Declare the export structure: 
			
		```wl
		// Export structure
		STWebHookExport is Structure
			RobotName is string
			ControlName is string
			ControlCategory is string
			Severity is string
			ResponsibleList is string
			FirstError	is DateTime
			ErrorMessage is string
			IsError is boolean
			CustomError is string
		END
		
		garrWebhookInfo is array of STWebHookExport
		```


	- Retrieve and deserialize data before using it: 
			
		```wl
		bufPOSTData is Buffer = PageParameter(paramBuffer)
		Deserialize(garrWebhookInfo,bufPOSTInfo,psdJSON)
		```

### Configuring the status report
<a name="configuring_the_status_report_ELTPARAGRAPHE000167"></a>The "Configuring the status report" tab is used to configure the subject of the message sent (by email or by WDBal).<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Param_robot%20-%20HC%20N%B0004.gif)


- The "Object of email sent" section is used to build the title of the message. Macros are used to get specific information (name of the robot, number of checks in error, ...).

- The "Alert mode" section is used to choose the alert mode: 

	- **"Continuous alert" mode** (by default): 
			If a given check encounters errors multiple times in a row (for example, if the server does not respond for several minutes), the robot will systematically send an alert for each error.

	- **"Fail/Resume" mode**
			If a given check is in error several times in a row (if the server does not respond during several minutes for example), the robot will perform the following operations: 
			**1.** The robot will send an alert when the first error is detected.
			**2.** The robot will send intermediate alerts every xx minutes. The timeout between each send operation can be configured.
			You also have the ability to send no intermediate message.
			**3.** The robot will send a message when the check is no longer is error (if the server is restarted for example).
			**Remarks**:

		- The "Fail/Resume" mode applies to all the checks (it cannot be specified for a specific check).

		- If this mode is enabled and if the robot monitors sensitive elements, we advise you to send intermediate messages.

		- Example of progress: 
						

| Time | Status of the check | Continuous Alert mode | Fail/Resume mode |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Time T | Check with errors | Alert send | Alert send |
| Time T+1 | Check with errors | Alert send | No alert send |
| Time T+2 | Check with errors | Alert send | No alert send |
| Time T+3 | Check with errors | Alert send | No alert send |
| Time T+4 | Check with errors | Alert send | No alert send |
| Time T+5 | Check correct | No alert send | Alert send |
