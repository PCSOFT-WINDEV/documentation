A report provides a custom view of data: data entered in the database, data in a text file, data from a Table control, etc, ... 

Reports can be displayed on the screen, saved in an HTML file, printed, etc.

A report can be used to summarize and synthesize data.

You can:

- group data.

- sort data based on different criteria.

- perform calculations (means, statistics) or even create charts.




The diagram below illustrates the concept of reports:

- the data to print comes from a data source (data file described in an analysis, HFSQL view, query, memory area or text file).

- the report groups, sorts and formats the data.

- the report can be represented on the screen, as a file (HTML, RTF, etc.). or sent to the printer.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P1-Edition-Les-Etats.gif)
