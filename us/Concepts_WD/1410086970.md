The UI (User Interface) of an application is mainly composed of windows.

WINDEV includes an advanced window editor allowing you to easily and quickly develop all types of UI.

Several features allow you to easily obtain intuitive and user-friendly applications:

- powerful controls,

- an anchoring mechanism allowing the UI to automatically adapt to the size of the display,

- a UI compilation system with error detection (empty titles, untranslated text, overlaps, etc.), 

- etc.
