## Individual setup

The individual setup consists in creating a setup program that will be installed on each user computer via a setup media.

This setup mode is compatible with:

- data files in HFSQL Classic format installed on the user computer,

- data files in HFSQL Classic format installed on a network and accessible from the user computer,

- data files in HFSQL Client/Server format installed on a server.

## Network setup (with automatic update)
<a name="network_setup_with_automatic_update_ELTTEXTE000187"></a>
The network setup consists in creating a setup program that will be installed on a server. All the user computers that will install the application must start the application setup via the network.

If an update is available on the application server, users will be prompted to update the application on startup.

A network setup allows for better management (versions deployed, mandatory updates, disconnection of users, etc.).

This setup mode is compatible with:

- data files in HFSQL Classic format installed on the user computer,

- data files in HFSQL Classic format installed on a network and accessible from the user computer,

- data files in HFSQL Client/Server format installed on a server.

## HTTP setup (with automatic update)
<a name="http_setup_with_automatic_update_ELTTEXTE000211"></a>
The HTTP setup consists in creating a setup program that will be installed on a Web server.

All the user computers that will install the application must start the application setup via an HTTP URL. 

If an update is available on the Web server, users will be prompted to update the application on startup.

## Multisite setup (with automatic update)
<a name="multisite_setup_with_automatic_update_ELTTEXTE000235"></a>
The multisite setup allows you to install an application on different sites (a site can represent a subsidiary, for example).

The multisite setup consists in creating a setup program that will be installed on a Web server.

All the sites that will install the application must start the application setup via an HTTP URL. In this case, the setup program will be installed on a server of the site.

All the user computers that will install the application must start the setup via the network.

This setup combines the advantages of the network setup and the HTTP setup by allowing a large-scale deployment as well as a better control of local setups.

If an update is available on the Web server, the application is automatically updated on the application server.

## Push network setup
<a name="push_network_setup_ELTTEXTE000259"></a>
The network setup consists in creating a setup program that will be installed on a server.

Using WD1xxAdminExe, the network administrator installs the application from the server on the client computers.

A Push setup can be updated either in Push mode, or as part of a network setup.
