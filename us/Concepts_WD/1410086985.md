Project configurations allow you to easily define the "target" platforms of the project. Multiple executables, components and libraries can be defined for the same project.

You can select each configuration individually to generate the corresponding program.

There is a faster method: the **multiple generation**. You can select all the configurations to be generated at the same time to obtain the corresponding programs immediately.

To start a multiple generation, go to the "Project" tab, "Generation" group and click "Multiple generation".
