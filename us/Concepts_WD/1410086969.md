WINDEV covers the entire application development life cycle:<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P1-Cycle%20de%20d%E9veloppement%20d'une%20application.gif)
**Details of the different steps**:

**Design phase**: An application can be designed from specific requirements, a UML modeling of the processes or even from existing data files.

**Development phase**: The project and the analysis are created via specific wizards. The application can be developed in RAD (Rapid Application Development) mode, with automatic code and interface generation; or it can result from manually creating multiple project elements.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P1-Cycle%20de%20d%E9veloppement%20d'une%20application-phases.gif)
**Testing and generation phase**: WINDEV includes several automated test tools to guarantee application reliability and make sure there are no regressions during the development steps.

**Deployment phase**: A WINDEV application can be deployed using one of the following methods: download, over a local area network (including Push mode) or via the Internet. In any case, the HFSQL data files will be automatically updated based on the changes made to the application.
