Smart controls are an innovative concept for creating UIs. A Smart control is a ready-to-use control (or group of controls) that includes a "business logic" WLanguage code where necessary.

Thanks to the Smart controls, you can add sophisticated behaviors to your WINDEV applications with a single click.

WINDEV includes several Smart controls: Twitter, Instagram, Signature, Countdown, Date range selection,
Menu with drawers, Workflow, Cookie consent, Process monitoring, and more.

To integrate a Smart control into your interfaces: 

1. On the "Creation" tab, in the "Smart" group, click "Smart controls". 

2. Select the desired control in the window that appears: <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P1_Champ_m%E9tier_wd%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif&type=thumb)
You can: 

	- Browse through the different types of controls, 

	- Enter keywords in the search box. 


 Remark: The "Go" button that appears when hovering over the Smart controls allows you to see and try the control before integrating it in your window. 

3. Select the desired control, drag it and drop it onto the window editor.
