The Project Monitoring Center allows the project contributors to manage their task schedule. These tasks can be linked to certain requirements and correspond to multiple projects.

Once the project tasks have been defined, you can follow their progress in the Project Monitoring Center. The time spent on a task is calculated automatically, it does not require any specific action and does not generate any particular constraints.

When the relevant project is opened, the Project Monitoring Center requests or indicates the current task. As soon as a task is completed, simply indicate that the task is finished and specify the new task.

A task can be linked to a project element (window, report, etc.). When the element is opened, the time spent on it is counted and stored in the Project Monitoring Center. Conversely, the element that corresponds to the desired task can be automatically opened from the task list.
Each developer can also see their own task list in the "Project Monitoring Center" pane in the editor.
