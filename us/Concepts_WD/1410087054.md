HFSQL Client/Server is a powerful system for managing relational databases (RDBMS) in Client/Server mode.

The characteristics of HFSQL Client/Server are as follows:

- An HFSQL Client/Server application can be run on different client computers that communicate with the database server over the network.

- Data files are located on a server. Only the server physically accesses the data files.

- All processes (queries, read from and write records to a data file, etc.) are performed on the server.
