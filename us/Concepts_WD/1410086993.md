In addition to Windows applications, WINDEV allows you to generate other types of projects.

Applications developed with WINDEV can run on the following platforms: Windows (32 or 64-bit) and Linux. |
| <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Logo_modes_generation%20-%20HC%20Service.gif)<br> | **Services**<br><br>WINDEV allows you to generate services for Windows (32 or 64-bit) and Linux (in Linux, services are usually called daemons). A service is a specific type of application, started at the same time as the operating system but without an interface. |
| <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Logo_modes_generation%20-%20HC%20Bibli.gif)<br> | **Libraries and patches**<br><br>A library is a single file that contains multiple elements of a WINDEV project: windows, reports, etc. You can generate stand-alone libraries that can be used by other applications as well as patches for an application that is already deployed. This allows you to avoid reinstalling the entire application for a minor correction. |
| <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Logo_modes_generation%20-%20HC%20Compo%20ext.gif)<br> | **External components**<br><br>External components are application snippets that allow you to share one or more specific functionalities between multiple applications. An external component generated by WINDEV can also be used in a WEBDEV or WINDEV Mobile project. |
| <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Logo_modes_generation%20-%20HC%20WebS.gif)<br> | **SOAP or REST Webservices**<br><br>A Webservice (also called XML Web service) can be generated from a WINDEV or WEBDEV project. A Webservice uses a set of functions (one or more sets of procedures) and makes them accessible via the web (or a private network) using HTTP, SOAP and REST.<br><br>Remark: A Webservice must be deployed to a WEBDEV Application Server to be used. |
| <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Logo_modes_generation%20-%20HC%20Net.gif)<br> | **Applications and .Net assembly DLLs**<br><br>WINDEV allows you to generate applications and assemblies for the .Net platform of Microsoft. A .Net assembly generated by WINDEV can be imported into a .Net application developed in another language in a way similar to an external component shared between two WINDEV applications. |
| <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Logo_modes_generation%20-%20HC%20Java.gif)<br> | **Java applications**<br><br>WINDEV allows you to generate Java applications. Java applications can be run on any computer equipped with a Java virtual machine, regardless of its operating system. This allows you to build applications that run on Windows, Mac OS or Solaris, for example. |
| <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Logo_modes_generation%20-%20HC%20W%20Uni.gif)<br> | **Universal Windows Platform applications**<br><br>WINDEV allows you to generate Universal Windows Platform applications. These applications can be used in tile mode or be distributed via the Windows Store. |
