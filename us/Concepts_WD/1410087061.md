Universal replication makes it possible to keep databases of the same or different formats updated (HFSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, etc.). For example, you can synchronize an HFSQL Classic database with an Oracle database.

Universal replication uses a centralized model: all databases are synchronized with a master database. Then, the master database reflect the changes in the other databases.

The synchronization can be adapted to special cases. For example, you can retrieve the records related to a specific product or created on a given date, manage conflicts, display a configuration window, etc.

These adaptations must be done through programming with [HRplFilterProcedure](../WDLang4/3044300.md).
