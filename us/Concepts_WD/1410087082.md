An application depends on several external parameters: Website, HFSQL server, network, etc. To optimize the management of incidents, WINDEV allows you to use a monitoring robot.

The monitoring robot, which is composed of three executables running on different computers, is used to run different tests: Internet connectivity check, network tests, etc.

If a problem occurs during a test, the monitoring robot sends you a message using one of the following methods:

- Message sent via PC SOFT's messaging tool (WDBAL).

- Email.

- Via a third-party program.


Furthermore, a sound alert can be implemented on the monitor.
