WINDEV allows you to create window templates. These templates contain all the graphic elements common to all windows of your application.

Changes made to a window template are automatically applied to all the windows that use the template.

A window template follows the style book defined for an application.

Template used in multiple windows.
Elements from the template are identified by a yellow square.

**Remark**: The programming associated with the template elements can be performed in the template directly.

The characteristics of the elements can be dissociated from the template. For example, dissociate the position of a control from the template to move it elsewhere while keeping other changes (code, style, etc.). This is referred to as **control inheritance**. In this case, the elements are identified by a blue square.
