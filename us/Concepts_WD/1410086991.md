An external component is a set of WINDEV elements : windows, reports, analysis, etc. This set of elements performs a specific operation. For example, an external component can correspond to one of the following actions:

- Sending SMSs,

- Sending emails,

- etc.




A WINDEV external component can be distributed to other WINDEV developers (free or not). Developers will be able to easily include the functionalities of the external component in their applications. The external component will be included in the application and distributed with the application.
