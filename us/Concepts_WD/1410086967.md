The development of a **Windows Application** with WINDEV is based on two main elements: the Project and the Analysis.

A **WINDEV Project** is a set of elements (windows, reports, controls, classes, components, etc.), which put together, make it possible to create a Windows application.

A **WINDEV Analysis** is a diagram of the data used by the application. The analysis groups the different data files (tables) used by the application.

An application is built from a project.

In most cases, a project is associated with an analysis.

An analysis can be associated with one or more projects.
