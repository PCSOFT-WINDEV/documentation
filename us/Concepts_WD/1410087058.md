A query is used to request information from a database to view, insert, change or delete data. The query structure defines the data used.

A query can request information from one or more data files.

The query editor allows you to easily create queries without programming.

**Remark**: In the code, you can handle queries and data files in the same way. Queries can be associated with controls in the UI (a Table control, for example) to display the desired data.
