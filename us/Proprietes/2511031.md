### What is a query performed on a connection?
<a name="what_query_performed_connection_ELTPARAGRAPHE000010"></a>

A [query performed on a connection](../WDChamp/1011066.md) is a query performed on data files handled via a specific ODBC driver or a Native Connector.

When the connection is created, you can define: 

- the connection name

- the name of the data source

- the username and password

- the name of the database accessed (if there is more than one). 


The report editor allows you to print the data coming from a query performed on a connection. All the parameters of the connection to use can be defined in the report editor or through programming with the WLanguage properties.

The **ODBCPassword** property is used to:

- Identify the password used to connect to a database via an ODBC driver or a Native Connector. This password is associated with a user and it must be specified when printing a report based on a "query performed on a connection".

- Specify the password used to connect to a database via an ODBC driver or a Native Connector. This password is associated with a user and it must be specified when printing a report based on a "query performed on a connection".




**Remark**: This property must be used in the opening code of the report.
