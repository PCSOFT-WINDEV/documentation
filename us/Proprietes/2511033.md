### What is a query performed on a connection?
<a name="what_query_performed_connection_ELTPARAGRAPHE000010"></a>

A [query performed on a connection](../WDChamp/1011066.md) is a query performed on data files handled via a specific ODBC driver or a Native Connector.

When the connection is created, you can define: 

- the connection name

- the name of the data source

- the username and password

- the name of the database accessed (if there is more than one). 


The report editor allows you to print the data coming from a query performed on a connection. All the parameters of the connection to use can be defined in the report editor or through programming with the WLanguage properties.

The **ODBCConnectionName** property is used to:

- Find out the name of the ODBC connection used when printing a report based on a "query performed on a connection".

- Specify the name of the ODBC connection used when printing a report based on a "query performed on a connection".




**Remark**: This property must be used in the opening code of the report.

```wl
// -- Opening code of the report
RPT_Report1.ODBCConnectionName = "MyConnection"
RPT_Report1.ODBCSQLCode = "Select * from Products"
RPT_Report1.ODBCUserName = "MOORE"
RPT_Report1.ODBCPassword = "PSW"

**`<Report used>: (Report name)`**

Name of the report to be used.

**`<Connection to use>: (Character string)`**

Name of the connection used to perform the base query of the report via the ODBC driver or a Native Connector. This connection name must be defined in the administrator of the driver or Native Connector used on the current computer.
