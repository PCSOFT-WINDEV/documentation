The **ZOrder** property defines the Z-order of an element. You can:

- Get the Z-order position of a control in a window or report. This Z-order position is relative to the window or report. If the control is placed in a tab pane, the Z-order position is set within the tab.

- Set the Z-order position of a control (for example, define if the control is to be placed at the front or at the back of the z-order). The Z-order of a control can be set in relation to the Z-order position of another control in the window or report.

## Syntax

### Getting the position of a control in the Z-order

`<Control Z-order> = <Control used>.ZOrder`
---

**`<Control Z-order>: (Integer)`**

Z-order position between 1 and the total number of controls in the report block or the window.

- **1** corresponds to the lowest position in the Z-order (back).

- The **total number of controls** corresponds to the highest position in the Z-order (front).




**`<Control used>: (Control name)`**

Name of the control in the window or report.  


<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Changing the Z-order position of a control

`<Control used>.ZOrder = <New control Z-order>`
---

**`<Control used>: (Control name)`**

Name of the control in the window or report.

**`<New control Z-order>: (Integer (greater than or equal to 1))`**

If the new Z-order position is greater than the number of controls in the window or report, the control will be placed at the front (on top of all controls). The real Z-order position will be equal to the number of controls present in the window or in the report block.

## Remarks




### Single Z-order position
<a name="single_zorder_position_ELTPARAGRAPHE000110"></a>

Two controls in the same group have a unique Z-order position.
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>




### Changing the position in the Z-order
<a name="changing_the_position_the_zorder_ELTPARAGRAPHE000118"></a>

Changing the Z-order position of a control may offset the position of the other controls (by 1).

When the Z-order position of one control changes, it only affects the position of the controls between the initial and new Z-order positions: the Z-order position of these controls automatically decreases by 1. 
For example, if the Z-order position of a control changes from 4 to 8, only the z-order position of the controls between 4 and 8 will change: their Z-order position will decrease by 1 (the control with a previous Z-order position of 5 will be set to 4).

### Features specific to Tab controls

If the window contains a Tab control:
