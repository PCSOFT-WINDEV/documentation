The **RepeatableReadSupported** property is used to: 

- Find out whether the data file (file defined in the data model editor or through programming) can be used in HFSQL Client/Server in a transaction that includes a "Repeatable Read" isolation mode.

- Allow the use of a transaction that includes a "Repeatable Read" isolation mode for a data file (when the file is described through programming only).




Caution: if this option is enabled, the file is not compatible with versions 18 and earlier.

This property corresponds to the "Allow the REPEATABLE READ transactions (requires HFSQL version 19 or later)" option in the "Details" tab of the file description window in the analysis.
