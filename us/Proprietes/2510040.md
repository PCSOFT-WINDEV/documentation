The **BrowsedFile** property gets and sets the data source used to display records in controls based on a data file: 

- Table or TreeView Table controls based on a data file.

- List Box or ListView controls based on a data file.

- Combo Box controls based on a data file.

- columns of type Combo Box based on a data file.

- Looper controls based on a data file.

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Organizer controls based on a data file.

- Scheduler controls based on a data file.

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) TreeView controls based on a data file.

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Organization Chart controls based on a data file.

- Kanban controls based on a data file.

- internal windows (if the swipe gesture is enabled). 

- supercontrols. 




This data source can be:

- a data file or a query. The records displayed are from this data file or query.

- a variable (array, class member, advanced member, etc.)




This data source is defined in the control description ("Content" tab).

## Example


```wl
// Displays all the customers in a Table control
TABLE_Table1.BrowsedFile = "Customers"
// Displays the entire content of the Qry_Customers query in a Table control
TABLE_Table1.BrowsedFile = "Qry_Customers"

// Displays the contacts of the gAContact variable
// gAContact is a gglContact variable
TABLE_Table1.BrowsedFile = ":gAContact"
```

## Syntax

### Getting the data file, query or variable used as data source

`<Browsed element> = <Control used>.BrowsedFile`
---

**`<Browsed element>: (Character string)`**

Name of the element used as data source for the relevant control. This element can correspond to:

- the name of the data file or query.

- the name of the variable. This name has the following format ":&lt;prefix&gt;&lt;Variable name&gt;" or ":&lt;Variable name&gt;". The prefix is applied only if the code style is enabled in the project.




**`<Control used>: (Control name)`**

Name of the control whose data source is requested. This control must be of the following type: 

- Table or TreeView Table based on a data file.

- List Box or ListView based on a data file.

- Combo Box based on a data file.

- Column of type Combo Box based on a data file.

- Looper based on a data file.

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Organizer based on a data file.

- Scheduler based on a data file.

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) TreeView based on a data file.

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Organization Chart based on a data file.

- Internal window.

- Kanban based on a data file.

### Changing the data file, query or variable used as data source

`<Control used>.BrowsedFile = <New data source>`
---

**`<Control used>: (Control name)`**

Name of the control whose current data source must be modified. This control must be a: 

- Table or TreeView Table based on a data file.

- List Box or ListView based on a data file.

- Combo Box based on a data file.

- Column of type Combo Box based on a data file.

- Looper based on a data file.

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Organizer based on a data file.

- Scheduler based on a data file.

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) TreeView based on a data file.

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Organization Chart based on a data file.

- Internal window.

- Kanban based on a data file.




**`<New data source>: (Character string)`**

Name of the element that must be associated with the relevant control:

- Name of the data file or name of the query.

- Variable name. This name has the following format ":&lt;prefix&gt;&lt;Variable name&gt;" or ":&lt;Variable name&gt;". The prefix must be specified only if the code style is enabled in the project (whether or not prefixes are displayed).


The control will be empty if this parameter does not correspond to a valid name. The iteration will be stopped if this parameter is an empty string.

## Remarks


### Using the **BrowsedFile** property
<a name="using_the_docparampagetitleshort_property_ELTPARAGRAPHE000177"></a>

The **BrowsedFile** property can be used both in programmed and automatic iteration operations

If the **BrowsedFile** property is used to change the data source used, the iteration operation starts over again. For a Table control, this operating mode is identical to the use of [TableDisplay](../WDLang1/3074003.md) associated with the *taStart* constant.

### Changing the properties linked to the iteration of a control based on a data file
<a name="changing_the_properties_linked_the_iteration_control_based_data_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000196"></a>

To change multiple properties ([BrowsedItem](../Proprietes/2510111.md), [Filter](../Proprietes/2510042.md) and **BrowsedFile**) it is recommended to:

1. Stop the iteration by assigning an empty string ("") to the **BrowsedFile** property.

2. Change the relevant properties.

3. Restart the iteration with the **BrowsedFile** property.


This method is used to optimize the modifications performed. Each one of the modifications made individually restarts the iteration. These operations can become quite slow when they are performed on large data files.
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Type of iteration
<a name="type_iteration_ELTPARAGRAPHE000221"></a>

- ***Automatic iteration***: WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile manage the reading of the data file and the display of the data in the control. No specific programming is required.
	If the control can be sorted (table...), the sort is performed on the search item defined in the "Content" tab of the element description. 
	If a filter is specified ("Filter on the search item" in the "Content" tab of the object description), this filter is used.

- ***Programmed iteration***: The developer must program the reading of the data file and the display of the data in the control.
	A programmed iteration allows you to sort and filter records with precision. However, a programmed iteration is slower and more complex than an automatic iteration.

### Handling the controls based on a data file via the properties
<a name="handling_the_controls_based_data_file_via_the_properties_ELTPARAGRAPHE000235"></a>

- The records displayed in the browsing controls come from the data file or query specified by the **BrowsedFile** property.

- The sort direction is defined by the [BrowsedItem](../Proprietes/2510111.md) property.

- Depending on the type of control, the records can be filtered using the [Filter](../Proprietes/2510042.md) property or the [HFilter](../WDLang4/3044100.md) function.



<a name="NOTE0_5"></a>


### Limitations
<a name="limitations_ELTPARAGRAPHE000255"></a>

The **BrowsedFile** property applies only to controls in a window or page. This property applies only to the following controls:

- Table and TreeView Table controls based on a data file,

- List Box and ListView controls based on a data file,

- Combo Box controls based on a data file,

- Supercontrols, 

- Table columns (used to modify the data file linked to a Combo Box table column).

- Looper controls based on a data file,

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Organizer controls based on a data file.

- Scheduler controls based on a data file.

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) TreeView controls based on a data file.

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Organization Chart controls based on a data file.

- internal windows (if the swipe gesture is enabled). 

- Kanban controls based on a data file.
