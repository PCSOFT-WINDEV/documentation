The **User** property is used to manage the user of a connection (HFSQL Client/Server, OLE DB, etc.). You can:

- Identify the user of a connection (HFSQL Client/Server, OLE DB, etc.).

- Define the user of a connection (HFSQL Client/Server, OLE DB, ...). In this case, if the connection is currently opened, it will be closed and reopened with the new parameters during the first access to a file that uses this connection.




**Remark**: The connection can correspond to:

- a connection described in the data model editor,

- a connection described by [HConnect](../WDLang4/3044263.md), [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

- a connection described by a [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md) variable.

- by a [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md) variable.  





<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Defining the user of a connection

`<Connection used>.User = <New username>`
---

**`<Connection used>: (Connection name)`**
