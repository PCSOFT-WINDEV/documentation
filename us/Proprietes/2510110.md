The **StoredItem** property is used to:

- Find out the stored item or the stored variable of a Table, Looper, List Box or Combo Box control.

- Modify the stored item or the stored variable of a Table, Looper, List Box or Combo Box control.




**Remarks**:

- The stored item is used for controls associated with a data file or query. The stored variable is used for controls associated with a variable.

- The stored item or the stored variable is defined in the window editor or in the page editor, in the "Content" tab of the control description.<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=RubriqueMemorisee.gif)

## Syntax

### Finding out the stored item or variable of a control

`<Stored item/variable> = <Control used>.StoredItem`
---

**`<Stored item/variable>: (Character string)`**



- Name of stored item for the specified control. This item belongs to the data file the control is based on (returned or modified by the [BrowsedFile](../Proprietes/2510040.md) property).

- Name of stored variable for the specified control. This name has the following format ":&lt;prefix&gt;&lt;Variable Name&gt;" or ":&lt;Variable Name&gt;" (the prefix is used only if the code style is enabled in the project).
	This variable belongs to the variable the control is based on (returned or modified with the [BrowsedFile](../Proprietes/2510040.md) property).

- Empty string ("") if no stored item/variable is associated with the control.




**`<Control used>: (Control name)`**

Name of the control to be used: 

- Table control,

- List Box control, 

- Combo Box control.   





<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Modifying the stored item/variable of a control

`<Control used>.StoredItem = <New item/variable>`
---

**`<Control used>: (Control name)`**

Name of the control to be used: 

- Table control,

- List Box control, 

- Combo Box control. 




**`<New item/variable>: (Character string)`**



- Name of new stored item for the specified control. This item must belong to the data file the control is based on (returned or modified by the [BrowsedFile](../Proprietes/2510040.md) property).

- Name of the new stored variable for the specified control. This name has the following format ":&lt;prefix&gt;&lt;Variable name&gt;" or ":&lt;Variable name&gt;". The prefix must be specified only if the code style is enabled in the project (whether prefixes are displayed or not).
	This variable belongs to the variable the control is based on (returned or modified with the [BrowsedFile](../Proprietes/2510040.md) property).

- Empty string ("") if no stored item/variable must be associated with the control.

## Remarks


### Value property
<a name="value_property_ELTPARAGRAPHE000115"></a>

The **StoredItem** property modifies the value returned by the [Value](../Proprietes/2510130.md) property.

Two distinct cases may occur: 

- The List Box or Table control is handled programmatically OR the **StoredItem** property corresponds to an empty string (""). The [Value](../Proprietes/2510130.md) property allows you to:

	- Find out the selected row. If no row is selected, the [Value](../Proprietes/2510130.md) property returns -1. If the List Box control (or the Table control) is multi-selection, the number of the last selected row is returned.

	- Move the selection by specifying the number of the new row to select. The rows that were selected beforehand are deselected.
			**To identify the selected row**, use one of the following syntaxes: 
			
		```txt
		ResRow = <List Box or Table control>.Value
		ResRow = <List Box or Table control>
		```





- The List Box or Table control is based on a data file AND the **StoredItem** property is not an empty string (""). The [Value](../Proprietes/2510130.md) property is used to identify the stored item for the record associated with the selected row. If no row is selected, the [Value](../Proprietes/2510130.md) property returns an empty string ("").
	**To find out the stored item associated with the selected row**, the following syntaxes are equivalent:
	
	```txt
	ResStoredItem = <List Box or Table control>.Value
	ResStoredItem = <List Box or Table control>.StoredItem
	```

### DataBinding property
<a name="databinding_property_ELTPARAGRAPHE000159"></a>

The **StoredItem** property is often used in combination with the [DataBinding](../Proprietes/2510060.md) property . This association creates an automatic link between two data files when [FileToScreen](../WDLang4/3044210.md) and [ScreenToFile](../WDLang4/3044146.md) are called.
<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### Table control populated programmatically
<a name="table_control_populated_programmatically_ELTPARAGRAPHE000177"></a>

If a Table control populated programmatically must display data coming from a data file, a query or a view:

- Create a Table control populated programmatically in the window editor or in the page editor.

- In the code, specify the item to loop through with the [BrowsedItem](../Proprietes/2510111.md) property. This item must belong to the data file, to the query or to the view whose data will be displayed in the Table control populated programmatically.

- In the code, specify the item to be stored with the **StoredItem** property. This item must belong to the data file, to the query or to the view whose data will be displayed in the Table control populated programmatically.

- Use [FileToMemoryTable](../WDLang1/3074005.md) to initialize the Table control with the desired data. The data will be sorted according to the specified search item.

- The [DisplayedItem](../Proprietes/2510123.md) property will be automatically initialized.



<a name="NOTE0_4"></a>


### List Box control populated programmatically
<a name="list_box_control_populated_programmatically_ELTPARAGRAPHE000201"></a>

If a List Box or Combo Box control populated programmatically must display data coming from a data file, a query or a view:

- Create a List Box or Combo Box control populated programmatically in the window editor or in the page editor.

- Use [FileToMemoryList](../WDLang1/3049007.md) to initialize the control with the desired data.

- The [BrowsedFile](../Proprietes/2510040.md), [DisplayedItem](../Proprietes/2510123.md), [BrowsedItem](../Proprietes/2510111.md) and **StoredItem** properties will be automatically initialized.

### Seeking and selecting an element in a List Box or Combo Box control based on a data file
<a name="seeking_and_selecting_element_list_box_combo_box_control_based_data_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000226"></a>To seek and/or select an element in a List Box or Combo Box control based on a data file, we recommend that you use the following syntax:

```wl
LIST_OrderList.StoredItem = "CustomerID"
// Find and select the element whose CustomerID is "135"
LIST_OrderList = 135
// If the element sought is not found, LIST_OrderList will be set to -1
```

<a name="NOTE0_6"></a>


### Limitations
<a name="limitations_ELTPARAGRAPHE000236"></a>

The **StoredItem** property applies only to the following controls:

- Table control,

- List Box control,

- Combo Box control,

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) ListView control,
