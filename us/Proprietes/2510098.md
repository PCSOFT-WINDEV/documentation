To make a control accessible via the Tab key, check "Accessible by TAB" in the "UI" tab of the control description.

By default, the "Accessible by TAB" option is checked when the control is created.

All controls accessible via the Tab key are automatically included in window tab order. By default, the tab order is the order in which controls were created in the window.
