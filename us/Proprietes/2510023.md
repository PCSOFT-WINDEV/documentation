The horizontal alignment of a control consists in defining the position of the text in the control in relation to the borders of the control. This allows you to center the content of a Static control in relation to the control borders.

Several alignments are available:

- alignment to left ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Cadrage_gauche.gif)


- alignment to right ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Cadrage_Droite.gif)


- centered ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Cadrage_centre.gif)


- justified
