The **Replication** property is used to:

- identify the replication mode used for a data file (defined in the data model editor or through programming)

- specify the replication mode used for a data file (when the file is described by programming).




**This property can only be used in a log-based replication.**

## Example


```wl
// Checks whether the data file is configured for replication (log-based replication)
IF Customer.Replication = hNotReplicated THEN Info("Unable to replicate")
```

## Syntax

### Finding out the replication mode

`<Current mode> = <Data file>.Replication`
---

**`<Current mode>: (Integer constant)`**

The replication modes are as follows:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hMasterReplica* | The data file is a master replica ([HCreateMasterReplica](../WDLang4/3044175.md) was used to create the master replica) |
| *hNotReplicated* | The data file is not configured for a log-based replication. To implement log-based replication, select "Replication" in the file characteristics in the data model editor. |
| *hReplicated* | The data file is configured to be replicated. |
| *hSubscriberReplica* | The data file is a subscriber replica ([HCreateSubscriberReplica](../WDLang4/3044253.md) was used to create the subscriber replica) |



**`<Data file>: (Character string)`**

Name of the file used. This name was defined in the data model editor or with the [File Description](../WDLang4/1514065.md) type.  


<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Defining the replication mode

`<Data file>.Replication = <Replication mode>`
---

**`<Data file>: (Character string)`**

Name of the file used. This name was defined by the [File Description](../WDLang4/1514065.md) type.

**`<Replication mode>: (Integer constant)`**

The replication modes are as follows:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hNotReplicated* | The data file is not configured for a log-based replication. |
| *hReplicated* | The data file is configured to be replicated. |
