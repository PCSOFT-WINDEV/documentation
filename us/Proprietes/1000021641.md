## Remarks


- The Spreadsheet control must be configured to support multiple worksheets, if necessary: 

	- In the editor: In the "Details" tab of the control description window, check "Allow multiple worksheets". 

	- Through programming, use the [MultiWorksheet](../Proprietes/1000021639.md) property.




- The worksheets can be created: 

	- by the end user, 

	- with [SpreadsheetAddWorksheet](../WDLang1/1000021642.md) or [SpreadsheetInsertWorksheet](../WDLang1/1000021648.md),  

	- by loading an xlsx file containing several worksheets ([SpreadsheetLoad](../WDLang1/1000021340.md)).
