The **Directory** property is used to manage the physical directory of HFSQL files. This property takes into account the possible changes of directory performed by [HChangeDir](../WDLang4/3044168.md) or [HSubstDir](../WDLang4/3044028.md). You can:

- Identify the physical directory of a data file defined in the data model editor or through programming.

- Define a physical directory for a data file (when the file is described through programming).

## Example


```wl
// Find out the name and full path of the Customer data file
NameAndFullPath is String
NameAndFullPath = Customer.Directory + "\" + ...
	Customer.PhysicalName + Customer.Extension
// NameAndFullPath corresponds to "C:\MyFiles\Customer.Fic"
```

## Syntax

### Finding out the physical directory of a data file 

`<Current directory> = <Data file>.Directory`
---

**`<Current directory>: (Character string)`**

Name of the directory of the data file. This name takes into account the possible changes of directory performed by [HChangeDir](../WDLang4/3044168.md) or [HSubstDir](../WDLang4/3044028.md).

**`<Data file>: (Character string)`**

Logical name of the data file used. This name was defined in the data model editor or with the [File Description](../WDLang4/1514065.md) type.  


<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Defining a physical directory for a data file described through programming

`<Data file>.Directory = <New directory>`
---

**`<Data file>: (Character string)`**

Logical name of the data file used. This name was defined by the [File Description](../WDLang4/1514065.md) type.

**`<New directory>: (Character string)`**

Physical name of the directory.

![HFSQL Client/Server](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/HFCS.png) The directory of the data file must be relative to the database found on the server. For example: ".\\Data"
