The **CtAccess** property is used to set the type of access to the data file when connecting to a specific table via OLE DB. You can:

- Get the type of access to the data file used to connect to a table via OLE DB.
	The type of access can correspond to:

	- the type of access defined in the data model editor, 

	- the type of access specified in [HConnect](../WDLang4/3044263.md), [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).
			This property can be used for a data file or for a connection defined in the data model editor or through programming.




- Define the type of access to the data file used for connecting to a table via OLE DB (when programmatically describing the data file only).
	In this case, this property is equivalent to the [CtDescribedAccess](../Proprietes/2512048.md) property. 




**Reminder**: [HConnect](../WDLang4/3044263.md) is used to redefine one or more parameters of the OLE DB connection to a table. By default, the characteristics of the OLE DB connection are defined:

- in the data model editor during the description of the data file, 

- when the data file was described through programming.

## Syntax

### Finding out the type of access to the data file by a connection

`<Type of access> = <Data file or Connection>.CtAccess`
---

**`<Type of access>: (Constant)`**

Returns the type of access to the data file.


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hORead* | The data file can be accessed in read-only. You only have the ability to read the records. No record can be added or deleted. |
| *hOReadWrite* | The data file can be accessed in read/write. You have the ability to read the records and to write new records. |



**`<Data file or Connection>: (Character string)`**



- Name of the data file used. This name was defined in the data model editor or with the [File Description](../WDLang4/1514065.md) type.

- Name of the connection used. This name was defined in the data model editor, or with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

### Defining the type of access to the file by a connection

`<Data file or Connection>.CtAccess = <Type of access>`
---

**`<Data file or Connection>: (Character string)`**



- Name of the data file used. This name was defined in the data model editor or with the [File Description](../WDLang4/1514065.md) type.

- Name of the connection used. This name was defined in the data model editor, or with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).




**`<Type of access>: (Constant)`**

Defines the type of access to the data file.


|   |   |

## Remarks


### Miscellaneous
<a name="miscellaneous_ELTPARAGRAPHE000110"></a>

The [CtDescribedAccess](../Proprietes/2512048.md) property is used to get and change the type of access specified for the OLE DB connection when describing the data file.

### Equivalence

The **CtAccess** property is used to define the type of access to a data file handled by a connection. This property is kept for backward compatibility. It is recommended to use the [Access](../Proprietes/2512100.md) property. The [Access](../Proprietes/2512100.md) property is used to define the type of access to the data files handled by a connection.
