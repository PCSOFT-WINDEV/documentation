The **MaxHeight** property is used to get and change the maximum height of a control or window.

By default, the maximum height:

- of a control is equal to 2 147 483 647 (0x7FFFFFFF). This value is equivalent to "no maximum size limit".

- of a window is equal to 20 000. However, the size of windows should not exceed the size of the screen.




**Reminder**: The maximum height of a control or window is used during the following operations:

- Window resized by the user.

- Management of anchors.




The maximum height of a control or window is not used when the window is resized through programming (with the [Height](../Proprietes/2510050.md) property or the [WinSize](../WDLang1/3038020.md) function).

## Syntax

### Finding out the maximum height of an element

`<Current maximum height> = <Element used>.MaxHeight`
---

**`<Current maximum height>: (Integer)`**

Maximum height of the specified element (including borders) in pixels.

**`<Element used>: (Control name or window name)`**

Name of the element (window or control) whose maximum height will be calculated.  


<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Modifying the maximum height of an element

`<Element used>.MaxHeight = <New maximum height>`
---

**`<Element used>: (Control name or window name)`**

Name of element (window or control) whose maximum height will be modified.

**`<New maximum height>: (Integer)`**

New maximum height of the element (including borders) in pixels.

## Remarks


### Initial height (control and window)
<a name="initial_height_control_and_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000097"></a>

The initial height (described in the editor) is returned by the [InitialHeight](../Proprietes/2510043.md) property.

In most cases, the object height depends on the **MaxHeight** and [MinHeight](../Proprietes/2510035.md) properties. However, this constraint no longer applies when the height is changed programmatically (with the [Height](../Proprietes/2510050.md) property or the [WinSize](../WDLang1/3038020.md) function).
