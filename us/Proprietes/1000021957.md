## Example


```wl
x is Control
x <- ControlCreate("", typWire)
x.StartControl = BTN_NoName1
x.EndControl = BTN_NoName2
x.WayPoint = "10,50,10,120"
```



```wl
// Add a waypoint to the wire so that it follows the desired path
Waypoint1, Waypoint2 are Points 

Waypoint1.X = 280
Waypoint1.Y = 54

Waypoint2.X = 320
Waypoint2.Y = 54
WIRE_MyWire.MaxNbSegment = 20

WIRE_MyWire = [Waypoint1, Waypoint2]
```

### Finding out the mandatory waypoints for a Wire control

`<Result> = <Wire control>.WayPoint`
---

**`<Result>: (Array of points)`**

Array of [Point](../Motscles/1000018908.md) variables containing the coordinates of waypoints. 

Caution: By default, the coordinates of waypoints are relative to the start position of wire. To change this behavior, use the [OriginWaypoint](../Proprietes/1000022161.md) property.

**`<Wire control>: (Control name)`**

Name of the Wire control to use.


<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Modifying the mandatory waypoints for a Wire control

`<Wire control>.WayPoint = <New Points>`
---

**`<Wire control>: (Control name)`**

Name of the Wire control to be used

**`<New Points>: (Array of points)`**



- Array of [Point](../Motscles/1000018908.md) variables containing the coordinates of waypoints.

- Character string containing the different coordinates separated by commas. 

- Empty string ("") to delete all the waypoints. 




Caution: By default, the coordinates of waypoints are relative to the start position of wire. To change this behavior, use the [OriginWaypoint](../Proprietes/1000022161.md) property.
