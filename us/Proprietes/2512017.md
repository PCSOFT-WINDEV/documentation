The **CtExtendedInfo** property is used to get the additional information inserted into database connection string. You can get the additional information specified for the connection to a table via OLE DB for example.

This information was specified:

- when the connection was created in the data model editor.

- when the connection was defined in [HConnect](../WDLang4/3044263.md), [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).




This property can be used for a data file or for a connection defined in the data model editor or through programming.

**Reminder**: Extended information: Information inserted into the string for connecting to the database.
