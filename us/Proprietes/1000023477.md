The **NumberAccessiblePages** property is used to get the number of pages currently loaded in a PDF Reader or Word Processing control.

When opening a PDF file containing a large number of pages, the PDF control loads each page successively: some pages are not immediately accessible. This property returns the number of PDF pages currently loaded without having to wait for the end of load.

The behavior is identical for a DOCX file opened by a Word Processing control.
