The **FicEncryption** property is used to set the encryption method of a data file. You can:

- Get the encryption method of a data file (.FIC) (file defined in the data model editor or programmatically).

- Define the encryption method of a data file programmatically.

## Example


```wl
// Find out the encryption mode of the Customer data file
ResEncrypt = Customer.FicEncryption
```

## Syntax

### Finding out the encryption mode of a data file

`<Current encryption mode> = <Data file>.FicEncryption`
---

**`<Current encryption mode>: (Integer constant)`**

The encryption modes are:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hEncryptionAES128* | Encryption is performed only if a password is set for the data file. In this case, the data file is encrypted using a 128-bit AES algorithm with Output feedback (OFB). |
| *hEncryptionAES192* | Encryption is performed only if a password is set for the data file. In this case, the data file is encrypted using a 192-bit AES algorithm with Output feedback (OFB). |
| *hEncryptionAES256* | Encryption is performed only if a password is set for the data file. In this case, the data file is encrypted using a 256-bit AES algorithm with Output feedback (OFB). |
| *hEncryptionAuto* | Encryption is performed only if a password is set for the data file. In this case, the data file is encrypted according to an optimized encryption algorithm (RC5 16 rounds on 128 bits). |
| *hEncryptionNO* | No encryption is performed on the data file. |
| *hEncryptionRC5_12* | The data file is encrypted according to an optimized encryption algorithm (RC5 12 rounds on 128 bits). |
| *hEncryptionRC5_16* | The data file is encrypted according to an optimized encryption algorithm (RC5 16 rounds on 128 bits). |
| *hEncryptionStandard* | The data file is encrypted according to an optimized encryption algorithm on 128 bits. |



**`<Data file>: (Character string)`**

Name of the data file used. This name was defined in the data model editor or with the [File Description](../WDLang4/1514065.md) type.  


<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Defining the encryption mode of a data file

`<Data file>.FicEncryption = <New encryption mode>`
---

**`<Data file>: (Character string)`**

Name of the data file used. This name was defined by the [File Description](../WDLang4/1514065.md) type.

**`<New encryption mode>: (Integer constant)`**

The encryption modes are:



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hEncryptionAES128* | Encryption is performed only if a password is set for the data file. In this case, the data file is encrypted using a 128-bit AES algorithm with Output feedback (OFB). |
| *hEncryptionAES192* | Encryption is performed only if a password is set for the data file. In this case, the data file is encrypted using a 192-bit AES algorithm with Output feedback (OFB). |
| *hEncryptionAES256* | Encryption is performed only if a password is set for the data file. In this case, the data file is encrypted using a 256-bit AES algorithm with Output feedback (OFB). |
| *hEncryptionAuto* | Encryption is performed only if a password is set for the data file. In this case, the data file is encrypted according to an optimized encryption algorithm (RC5 16 rounds on 128 bits). |
| *hEncryptionNO* | No encryption is performed on the data file. |
| *hEncryptionRC5_12* | The data file is encrypted according to an optimized encryption algorithm (RC5 12 rounds on 128 bits). |
| *hEncryptionRC5_16* | The data file is encrypted according to an optimized encryption algorithm (RC5 16 rounds on 128 bits). |
| *hEncryptionStandard* | The data file is encrypted according to an optimized encryption algorithm on 128 bits. |

## Remarks


### 128-bit, 192-bit and 256-bit AES encryption with the OFB mode of operation
<a name="128bit_192bit_and_256bit_aes_encryption_with_the_ofb_mode_operation_ELTPARAGRAPHE000133"></a>

- If the data file is encrypted using the AES algorithm, it is necessary to use the same method to encrypt the memos ([MmoEncryption](../Proprietes/2512014.md) property) and indexes ([NdxEncryption](../Proprietes/2512010.md) property). 

- If there is encryption that uses the AES algorithm, the option "Enable a high-security level " is automatically applied. In this mode, a password must be set for the data file. This password will be requested at each automatic modification of the data file.
