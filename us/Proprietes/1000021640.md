The **CurrentWorksheet** property is used to get and change the current worksheet in a Spreadsheet control. 
<a name="Example1"></a>
<a name="sample_code"></a>

## Example


```wl
// Add a worksheet
nWorksheet is int 
nWorksheet = SpreadsheetAddWorksheet(PSHEET_MySpreadsheet)
// Select the worksheet
PSHEET_MySpreadsheet.CurrentWorksheet = nWorksheet
```

<a name="XSYNTAX"></a>

## Syntax
<a name="SYNTAX1"></a>

### Finding out the position of the current worksheet

`<Result> = <Spreadsheet control>.CurrentWorksheet`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**

Position of the current worksheet.

**`<Spreadsheet control>: (Control name)`**

Name of the Spreadsheet control to be used.


<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Modifying the current worksheet in a Spreadsheet control

`<Spreadsheet control>.CurrentWorksheet = <New value>`
---

**`<Spreadsheet control>: (Control name)`**

Name of the Spreadsheet control to be used.

**`<New value>: (Integer)`**

Position of the worksheet that will become the current worksheet. 



<a name="NOTE0"></a>
<a name="NOTE0_1"></a>

## Remarks


- If the Spreadsheet control does not manage the multiple worksheets: 

	- the modification of the current worksheet has no effect, 

	- the position of the current worksheet is always set to 1. 




- The Spreadsheet control management functions always handle the data in the current worksheet. 

- The syntaxes for accessing the cells always handle the current worksheet.
