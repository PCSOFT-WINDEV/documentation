The **MaxLeafPerRow** property is used to get and change the maximum number of elements in a row in an Organization Chart control. When this maximum number is reached for the last level of the hierarchy, the elements are presented on several rows (vertical organization chart) or on several columns (horizontal organization chart).  

**Remark**: The maximum number of leaves per row for an Organization Chart control is defined in the "General" tab of the control description window ("Move over several rows from").
