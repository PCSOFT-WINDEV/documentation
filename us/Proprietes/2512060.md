The **KeyType** property is used to set the characteristics of a key item. You can:

- Determine if an item is key for an item defined in the data model editor or through programming

- Define a key item (when the item is described through programming).





<a name="Example1"></a>
<a name="sample_code"></a>

## Example


```wl
// Define the characteristics of the Orders.OrdID key
Orders.OrdID.KeyType = hUniqueKey
...
// Validate the data file description
HDescribeFile(Orders)
```

## Syntax

### Determining if an item is key

`<Characteristic> = <Data file>.<Item>.KeyType`
---

**`<Characteristic>: (Integer constant)`**

The characteristics of an item are:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hDuplicatesKey* | Key with duplicates. This item can have the same value for several data file records. |
| *hNotAKey* | The item is not a key. |
| *hPrimaryKey* | Primary key. The value assigned to this item will not be null and will only be in the data file. |
| *hUniqueKey* | Unique key. The value assigned to this item will be unique in the data file. No file record will have the same value for this item. |



**`<Data file>: (Character string)`**

Name of the data file used. This name was defined in the data model editor or with the [File Description](../WDLang4/1514065.md) type.

**`<Item>: (Character string)`**

Name of the item used. This name was defined in the data model editor or with the [Item Description](../WDLang4/1514071.md) type.
