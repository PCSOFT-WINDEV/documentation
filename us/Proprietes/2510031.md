The **Detection** property is used to determine and change the automatic detection of incoming streams. If the stream detection is enabled, the streams allows the detection. 

The automatic detection of streams is enabled by default.

Remark: This property is equivalent to the "Detection of incoming streams enabled" option found in the description window of streams. To open the stream management window go to the "Window" tab, "Edit" group, expand "Other actions" and select "Edit streams".. This option is available if a Conference is found in the window.

From version 20, Conference controls are supported in Windows Vista and later. If you want to use the Conference control with an earlier Windows version: 

1. Open the control description window. 

2. In the "UI" tab, check "Use the TAPI 3.x APIs / Windows XP (for compatibility)". 

3. Validate.

## Example


```wl
// Allows the detection of incoming streams
MyStream.Detection = Active
```

## Syntax

### Finding out the mode for detecting the incoming streams

`<Result> = <Stream name>.Detection`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer constant)`**

Current management mode of incoming streams:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *Active* | Automatic detection of incoming streams. The procedure for automatic detection of incoming streams is run for each new incoming stream. |
| *Inactive* | No automatic detection of incoming streams. The procedure for automatic detection of incoming streams is ignored for each new incoming stream. |



**`<Stream name>: (Character string)`**

Name of the stream or name of the Conference control associated with the stream.  


<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Modifying the mode for detecting the incoming streams

`<Stream name>.Detection = <New mode>`
---

**`<Stream name>: (Character string)`**

Name of the stream or name of the Conference control associated with the stream.

**`<New mode>: (Integer constant)`**

New management mode of incoming streams:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *Active* | Automatic detection of incoming streams. The procedure for automatic detection of incoming streams is run for each new incoming stream. |
| *Inactive* | No automatic detection of incoming streams. The procedure for automatic detection of incoming streams is ignored for each new incoming stream. |

## Remarks


### Use example
<a name="use_example_ELTPARAGRAPHE000082"></a>

An application allows the user not to be interrupted during a video-conference. This option uses the **Detection** property to block the automatic detection of incoming calls.

In this case, all the incoming calls are ignored. The automatic procedure for detecting the incoming calls is not run.
