The **AnchorRateHeight** property is used to:

- Find out the vertical anchor rate of a control

- Modify the vertical anchor rate of a control.




The anchor rate is used to define how the control is moved or resized in relation to the evolution of size of window (or report) to which it is anchored. The anchor rate corresponds to the percentage by which the control moves in relation to the window (or report). Therefore, if the anchor rate is set to 0, the control will not be resized. If it is set to 1000, the control will be resized normally.

The vertical anchor rate (**AnchorRateHeight** property) is applied if the control is anchored to the top (*anchorHeight* constant used with the [Anchor](../Proprietes/2510001.md) property).
