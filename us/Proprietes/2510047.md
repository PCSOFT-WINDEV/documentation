### Definition

The mouse cursor allows you to easily determine where an action will be performed. For a control in edit mode, the cursor turns into a blinking vertical line, allowing you to identify the location of the next character typed. 
Selected characters are displayed in inverted colors. The position of the cursor corresponds to the beginning of the area displayed in inverted colors. 

For example: 


| <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=position1.gif)<br> | The input cursor is placed at the beginning of the input area. Its position is 1. |
| --- | --- |
| <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=Position_fin.gif)<br> | The input cursor is placed at the end of the input area. Its position is 7 in this example. |
| <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=position_sel.gif)<br> | The input cursor is placed at the beginning of the area in "reverse video" (position 3 in this example). The **CursorEnd** property gets and sets the end of the selected area. |

The **CursorEnd** property gets and sets the end position of the mouse selection range in the following controls:

- Edit control.

- Editable Combo Box.

- "Edit control" column and "Editable Combo Box" column in a Table control.

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) Word Processing control. 




Remark: To get the text selected in an Edit control, an editable Combo Box or a column in a Table control, you can use [SelectedText](../Proprietes/1000017193.md).



**Tip**: To select a text section in an edit control from a button:

1. The option "Automatic erase" must not be enabled in the edit control (unless the entire content of the control must be deleted).

2. The button must be an "Interrupt" button and contain the following code, for example.





<a name="Example1"></a>
<a name="sample_code"></a>

## Example


```wl
// -- Click code of BTN_Selection button (Interrupt button)
// Select the entire text
EDT_Edit1.Cursor = 1
EDT_Edit1.CursorEnd = Length(EDT_Edit1) + 1
```
<a name="Example2"></a>

```wl
// Deselect the text
EDT_Edit1.CursorEnd = EDT_Edit1.Cursor
```
<a name="Example3"></a>

```wl
// Place cursor at the end of the text
EDT_Edit1.CursorEnd = Length(EDT_Edit1) + 1
EDT_Edit1.Cursor = EDT_Edit1.CursorEnd
```

## Syntax

### Finding out the position of the last selected character

`<Position> = <Control used>.CursorEnd`
---

**`<Position>: (Integer)`**

Position of last selected character + 1. If no character is selected, the [Cursor](../Proprietes/2510025.md) and **CursorEnd** properties are equivalent. If the control is not in edit, the position is 0.
<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=image17.gif)


**`<Control used>: (Control name)`**

Name of the control in which a selection was performed.  


<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Selecting a set of characters

`<Control used>.CursorEnd = <Number of selected characters>`
---

**`<Control used>: (Control name)`**

Name of the control in which a selection must be performed.

**`<Number of selected characters>: (Integer)`**

The selected string is between the cursor position and the value passed to the **CursorEnd** property. 
The smallest possible value is 1 (cursor on the left). The greatest value corresponds to the number of characters found in the control + 1. 
**Caution**: If the content of the **CursorEnd** property is assigned to the property itself, the text is deselected: no character is displayed in reverse video.

## Remarks


### Limit: Selection in reverse video
<a name="limit_selection_reverse_video_ELTPARAGRAPHE000137"></a>

The selection in reverse video is available only if the control is being edited. If the control is not in edit mode, the **CursorEnd** property returns 0.
