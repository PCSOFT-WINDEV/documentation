<a name="NOTE0"></a>
<a name="NOTE0_1"></a>

## Remarks


- This property is equivalent to the [Caption](../Proprietes/2510053.md) property on Image, Clickable Image, Captcha, Thumbnail, Bar Code and Chart controls.

- The alternative text of an image ("alt" attribute in HTML) indicates the text displayed by the browser when the image is not available. This text is also used instead of the image for the accessibility of pages.

- The alternative text can also be defined in the editor in the description window of the control. For example: 

	- in the "Help" tab for Image, Bar Code, and Thumbnail controls,

	- in the "Details" tab for Captcha controls,

	- in the "UI" tab for Chart controls.
