The **State** property is used to get and change the state: 

- of a control in a window, page or report. 

- of a block in a report,

- of a window. 




![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) **In a window**, the **State** property is used to get and change the state:

- of a window,

- of a control or group of controls,

- of a "container" control (Tab, Internal Window, Layout, etc.)

- of a cell or row in a Table control,

- of a menu option.






![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) **In a report**, the **State** property is used to get and change the visibility of a control or block. This property is kept for compatibility with WINDEV 5.5 and WEBDEV 1.5. To show or hide a control or a block in a report, use the [Visible](../Proprietes/2510138.md) property.

## Remarks


### Report (Report editor): Visible or invisible control/block
<a name="report_report_editor_visible_invisible_controlblock_ELTPARAGRAPHE000402"></a>

In a report, the only possible state for a control or a block is visible or invisible. To set the visibility of a control, it is recommended to use the [Visible](../Proprietes/2510138.md) property. This property optimizes the management of control visibility.
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### State of a group of controls
<a name="state_group_controls_ELTPARAGRAPHE000412"></a>

- Finding out the state of a group of controls: the state corresponds to the state of the first control in the group.

- Changing the state of a group of controls: all the controls of the group are modified and correspond to the new state.



<a name="NOTE0_3"></a>


### State of a column in a Table control
<a name="state_column_table_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000420"></a>

If the **State** property is applied to a column of a Table control, the state of the entire column is changed (and not only the state of the cell). 

Caution: the **State** property only restricts the state of the column defined in the description window. For example, if the column is read-only, no column cell can become editable.

### Tabs and controls of a tab pane
<a name="tabs_and_controls_tab_pane_ELTPARAGRAPHE000435"></a>

The state of a control in a tab pane depends on the state of the tab:

- If the pane is not selected, the control is invisible.

- If the pane is selected and invisible, the control is invisible.

- If the pane is selected and grayed out, the control is grayed out.

- If the pane is selected and disabled, the control is disabled.

- If the pane is selected and enabled, the control can be enabled, disabled, grayed out or invisible.

### Sidebar and pane controls
<a name="sidebar_and_pane_controls_ELTPARAGRAPHE000450"></a>

The state of a control found in a sidebar pane depends on the state of the pane:

- If the pane is not selected, the control is invisible.

- If the pane is selected and invisible, the control is invisible.

- If the pane is selected and grayed out, the control is grayed out.

- If the pane is selected and disabled, the control is disabled.

- If the pane is selected and enabled, the control can be enabled, disabled, grayed out or invisible.

### Radio Button/Check Box controls and their options
<a name="radio_buttoncheck_box_controls_and_their_options_ELTPARAGRAPHE000465"></a>

You can change the state of the control or the state of an option of the Radio Button/Check Box control. An option can be grayed out or enabled.

- To change the state of a Radio Button control: 
	
	```txt
	RADIO_Radio1.State = Grayed
	```


- To change the state of an option in a Radio Button control: 
	
	```txt
	RADIO_Radio1[2].State = Grayed
	```





**Caution**: The state of an option depends on the state of the Radio Button control. Therefore, if the following operations are performed:

1. An option is grayed out.

2. The Radio Button/Check Box control is grayed out.

3. The Radio Button/Check Box control is re-enabled. The option is still grayed out.

### Active control made invisible or not
<a name="active_control_made_invisible_not_ELTPARAGRAPHE000487"></a>

The [Visible](../Proprietes/2510138.md) property can be used to hide a control (enabled, grayed out or read-only).

When the control is invisible, it loses all the characteristics of its previous state: the control is invisible and it cannot be used. The only way to run its code is to call [ExecuteProcess](../WDLang1/3013031.md). For example, an invisible control does not respond when using the shortcut. For example, an active button made invisible does not respond when using the shortcut.

To restore the previous state of the control, simply use the [Visible](../Proprietes/2510138.md) property again.

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) 

### Menu options
<a name="menu_options_ELTPARAGRAPHE000509"></a>

The **State** property determines if the menu option is enabled or greyed out. To show or hide a menu option, use the [Visible](../Proprietes/2510138.md) property.


<a name="NOTE0_9"></a>


### Limitations
<a name="limitations_ELTPARAGRAPHE000529"></a>

![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png)![Universal Windows 10 App](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/UNIVERSALAPP.png) The **State** property has no effect on reports created with the report editor.![Java](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/JAVA.png) The **State** property can only be used with the following elements:

- Button.

- Static.

- Edit control.

- Image.

- Check Box.

- Radio Button.

- List Box.

- Combo Box.
