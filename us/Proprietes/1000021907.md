## Example


```wl
StartAttachPointID is int
EndAttachPointID is int

WIRE_Link_wire is Control

WIRE_Link_wire <- ControlCreate("Link", typWire)


WIRE_Link_wire.StartControl = IMG_Start
WIRE_Link_wire.EndControl = IMG_End

StartAttachPointID = AttachPointAdd(IMG_Start, 100, 25))
EndAttachPointID = AttachPointAdd(IMG_End, 0, 75))

WIRE_Link_wire.AttachPointStart = StartAttachPointID
WIRE_Link_wire.AttachPointEnd = EndAttachPointID
```

### Finding out the position of the start attach point in a Wire control

`<Result> = <Wire control>.AttachPointStart`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer or Integer constant)`**



- Identifier of the attach point (if the attach point was customized). This identifier corresponds to the value returned by [AttachPointAdd](../WDLang1/1000021902.md). 

- Constant corresponding to the position of the attach point (if this position was not customized). 
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *ptAutomatic*<br>(Default value) | WINDEV automatically selects the best attach point. |
| *ptBottomCenter* | The attach point is positioned in the middle of the bottom border of the control. |
| *ptTopCenter* | The attach point is positioned in the middle of the top border of the control. |
| *ptMiddleRight* | The attach point is positioned in the middle of the right border of the control. |
| *ptMiddleLeft* | The attach point is positioned in the middle of the left border of the control. |






**`<Wire control>: (Control name)`**

Name of the Wire control to be used.

### Modifying the position of the start attach point in a Wire control

`<Wire control>.AttachPointStart = <New value>`
---

**`<Wire control>: (Control name)`**

Name of the Wire control to use.

**`<New value>: (Integer or Integer constant)`**

This value can correspond to:

- the identifier of the attach point returned by [AttachPointAdd](../WDLang1/1000021902.md).

- one of the following constants: 
	


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *ptAutomatic*<br>(Default value) | WINDEV automatically selects the best attach point. |
| *ptBottomCenter* | The attach point is positioned in the middle of the bottom border of the control. |
| *ptTopCenter* | The attach point is positioned in the middle of the top border of the control. |
| *ptMiddleRight* | The attach point is positioned in the middle of the right border of the control. |
| *ptMiddleLeft* | The attach point is positioned in the middle of the left border of the control. |

## Remarks


- The end attach point can be customized with the [AttachPointEnd](../Proprietes/1000021908.md) property. 

- If the default attach points have been deleted by [AttachPointDeleteAll](../WDLang1/1000021903.md), the position constants cannot be used anymore.
