The **AnimationPeriod** property is used to get and modify rotation speed of the animation in the Cube or Carousel controls. More specifically, this property is used to define the duration of a rotation performed by the control.

## Example

```

## Syntax

### Finding out the animation period of controls

`<Result> = <Control used>.AnimationPeriod`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer)`**

Duration for a full rotation of the image around the axis in hundredths of a second.

**`<Control used>: (Control name)`**

Name of Cube or Carousel control to use.

### Modifying the animation period of controls

`<Control used>.AnimationPeriod = <New duration>`
---

**`<Control used>: (Control name)`**

Name of Cube or Carousel control to use.

**`<New duration>: (Integer ou Duration)`**

New duration for a full rotation of the image around the axis in hundredths of a second. This parameter can correspond to: 

- an integer corresponding to the number of hundredths of a second,

- a Duration variable,

- the duration in a readable format (e.g., '1cs' or '10 ms').

## Remarks
By default, the Cube control completes a full rotation in 350 hundredths of a second (3.5 seconds). 

By default, the Carousel control completes a full rotation in 1200 hundredths of a second (12 seconds).
