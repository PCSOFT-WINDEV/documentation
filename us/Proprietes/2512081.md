The **Second** property is used to:

- Retrieve the number of seconds from a [Time](../Motscles/1514068.md), [DateTime](../Motscles/1514070.md) or [Duration](../Motscles/1514069.md) variable.

- Modify the number of seconds in a [Time](../Motscles/1514068.md), [DateTime](../Motscles/1514070.md) or [Duration](../Motscles/1514069.md) variable.

- Retrieve the seconds or the number of seconds from a Date item (in "Date and Time" or "Duration" format).
	

- Modify the seconds or the number of seconds in a Date item (in "Date and Time" or "Duration" format).
	




**Remark**: The **Second** property is used to easily change times and durations.

**Reminder**: Date items are used to manage:

- "Year - Month - Day" dates (YYYYMMDD format)

- "Year - Month - Day - Hours - Minutes - Seconds - Milliseconds" dates and times (YYYYMMDDHHmmSSCCC format)

- "Number of days - Number of hours - Number of minutes - Number of seconds - Number of milliseconds" durations (+DHHMMSSCCC format)

## Example


```wl
// Operations performed on a DateTime variable
StartTime is DateTime = "200112311230250"
// Add 50 seconds
StartTime.Second += 50// Modify the seconds
StartTime.Second = 50
```

```wl
// Operations performed on a DateTime item
Work.StartTime = "200112311230250"
// Add 50 seconds
Work.StartTime.Second += 50// Modify the seconds
Work.StartTime.Second = 50

## Remarks




### Managing the seconds
<a name="managing_the_seconds_ELTPARAGRAPHE000177"></a>

- **Case 1: Direct assignment**
	During a direct assignment (for example, *MyWork.MyDateTime.Second = n*), the seconds must be found between 00 and 59. A WLanguage error occurs if an invalid number of seconds is specified.
	The notation *MyWork.MyDateTime.Second= MyWork.MyDateTime.Second + 5* may generate a runtime error.

- **Case 2: Operations on the seconds**
	When performing operations on the Date items (in 'Date and Time' or 'Duration' format), the seconds are included between 00 and 59. The addition or the subtraction of seconds automatically takes into account the changes from 59 seconds to 1 minute.

### Operators available for the seconds
<a name="operators_available_for_the_seconds_ELTPARAGRAPHE000192"></a>

The following arithmetic operators can be used with the **Second** property: 

- ++  and  --

- +=  and  -=





```wl
// Example on an item
Work.StartDateTime = "200411261324320"
Work.StartDateTime.Second++     // Add 1 second
Work.StartDateTime.Second+=5  // Add 5 seconds
Work.StartDateTime.Second-=5  // Subtract 5 seconds
```
