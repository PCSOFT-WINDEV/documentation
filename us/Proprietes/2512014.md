The **MmoEncryption** property is used to set the encryption method of the memo file (.MMO) associated with the data file. You can:

- Find out the encryption mode of a memo file associated with a data file (file defined in the data model editor or through programming).

- Define the encryption mode of a memo file associated with a data file during its description through programming.

## Example


```wl
// Find out the encryption mode of the memo file associated with the Customer data file
ResEncrypt = Customer.MmoEncryption

## Syntax

### Finding out the encryption mode of a MMO file

`<Current encryption mode> = <Data file>.MmoEncryption`
---

**`<Current encryption mode>: (Integer constant)`**

The encryption modes are:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hEncryptionAES128* | Encryption is performed only if a password is set for the data file. In this case, the memo file is encrypted using a 128-bit AES algorithm with Output feedback (OFB). |
| *hEncryptionAES192* | Encryption is performed only if a password is set for the data file. In this case, the memo file is encrypted using a 192-bit AES algorithm with Output feedback (OFB). |
| *hEncryptionAES256* | Encryption is performed only if a password is set for the data file. In this case, the memo file is encrypted using a 256-bit AES algorithm with Output feedback (OFB). |
| *hEncryptionAuto* | Encryption is performed only if a password is set for the data file. In this case, the memo file is encrypted according to an optimized encryption algorithm (RC5 16 rounds on 128 bits). |
| *hEncryptionNO* | No encryption is performed on the file. |
| *hEncryptionRC5_12* | The memo file is encrypted using an optimized 12-round RC5 encryption algorithm (128 bits). |
| *hEncryptionRC5_16* | The memo file is encrypted using an optimized 16-round RC5 encryption algorithm (128 bits). |
| *hEncryptionStandard* | The memo file is encrypted using an optimized 128-bit encryption algorithm. |



**`<Data file>: (Character string)`**

Name of the data file used. This name was defined in the data model editor or with the [File Description](../WDLang4/1514065.md) type.  


<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Defining the encryption mode of a MMO file

`<Data file>.MmoEncryption = <New encryption mode>`
---

**`<Data file>: (Character string)`**

Name of the data file used. This name was defined by the [File Description](../WDLang4/1514065.md) type.

**`<New encryption mode>: (Integer constant)`**

The encryption modes are:


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hEncryptionAES128* | Encryption is performed only if a password is set for the data file. In this case, the memo file is encrypted using a 128-bit AES algorithm with Output feedback (OFB). |
| *hEncryptionAES192* | Encryption is performed only if a password is set for the data file. In this case, the memo file is encrypted using a 192-bit AES algorithm with Output feedback (OFB). |
| *hEncryptionAES256* | Encryption is performed only if a password is set for the data file. In this case, the memo file is encrypted using a 256-bit AES algorithm with Output feedback (OFB). |
| *hEncryptionAuto* | Encryption is performed only if a password is set for the data file. In this case, the memo file is encrypted according to an optimized encryption algorithm (RC5 16 rounds on 128 bits). |
| *hEncryptionNO* | No encryption is performed on the file. |
| *hEncryptionRC5_12* | The memo file is encrypted using an optimized 12-round RC5 encryption algorithm (128 bits). |
| *hEncryptionRC5_16* | The memo file is encrypted using an optimized 16-round RC5 encryption algorithm (128 bits). |
| *hEncryptionStandard* | The memo file is encrypted using an optimized 128-bit encryption algorithm. |

## Remarks


### 128-bit, 192-bit and 256-bit AES encryption with the OFB mode of operation
<a name="128bit_192bit_and_256bit_aes_encryption_with_the_ofb_mode_operation_ELTPARAGRAPHE000132"></a>

- If the Memo file is encrypted using the AES algorithm, it is necessary to use the same method to encrypt the data ([FicEncryption](../Proprietes/2512046.md) property) and the indexes ([NdxEncryption](../Proprietes/2512010.md) property).

- If there is encryption that uses the AES algorithm, the option "High security level with password" is automatically applied.
