### What is a query performed on a connection?
<a name="what_query_performed_connection_ELTPARAGRAPHE000010"></a>

A [query performed on a connection](../WDChamp/1011066.md) is a query performed on data files handled via a specific ODBC driver or a Native Connector.

When the connection is created, you can define: 

- the connection name

- the name of the data source

- the username and password

- the name of the database accessed (if there is more than one). 


The report editor allows you to print the data coming from a query performed on a connection. All the parameters of the connection to use can be defined in the report editor or through programming with the WLanguage properties.

**ODBCDatabaseName** is used to:

- Find out the name of the database used when printing a report based on a "query performed on a connection".

- Specify the name of the database used when printing a report based on a "query performed on a connection".




**Remark**: This property must be used in the opening code of the report.

This property must be used only if several databases correspond to the same connection name.

## Example


```wl
// -- Opening code of the report
RPT_Report1.ODBCConnectionName = "MyConnection"
RPT_Report1.ODBCSQLCode = "Select * from Products"
RPT_Report1.ODBCUserName = "MOORE"
RPT_Report1.ODBCPassword = "PSW"
RPT_Report1.ODBCDatabaseName = "MyDatabase"
```

## Syntax

### Finding out the name of the database used when printing a report based on a "query performed on connection"

`<Result> = <Report used>.ODBCDatabaseName`
---

**`<Result>: (Character string)`**

Name of database used when printing the report based on a query performed on a connection. This name is available only if several connections of the same name corresponding to different databases have been defined.

**`<Report used>: (Report name)`**

Name of the report to be used.  


<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Specifying the name of database to use when printing a report based on a "query performed on a connection"

`<Report used>.ODBCDatabaseName = <Database to use>`
---

**`<Report used>: (Report name)`**

Name of the report to be used.

**`<Database to use>: (Character string)`**

Name of the database used to perform the base query of the report via the ODBC driver or a Native Connector. **This property must be used only if several databases correspond to the same name of connection.**

| **ODBCDatabaseName** | Used to identify and change the name of the database used by the query executed on a database accessed via an ODBC driver or a Native Connector. |
| [ODBCPassword](../Proprietes/2511031.md) | Used to identify and change the password associated with the user allowed to access a database via an ODBC driver or a Native Connector. |
| [ODBCSQLCode](../Proprietes/2511028.md) | Used to identify and change the SQL code of the query executed on a database accessed via an ODBC driver or a Native Connector. |
| [ODBCUserName](../Proprietes/2511019.md) | Used to identify and change the name of the user allowed to access a database via an ODBC driver or a Native Connector. |
