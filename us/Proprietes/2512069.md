The **Time** property enables you to:

- Retrieve the time from a [DateTime](../Motscles/1514070.md) variable.

- Modify the time in a [DateTime](../Motscles/1514070.md) variable.

- Retrieve the time from in a Date item (in "Date and Time" format).
	

- Modify the time in a Date item ("Date and Time" format).
	




**Reminder**: Date items are used to manage:

- "Year - Month - Day" dates (YYYYMMDD format)

- "Year - Month - Day - Hours - Minutes - Seconds - Milliseconds" dates and times (YYYYMMDDHHmmSSCCC format)

- "Number of days - Number of hours - Number of minutes - Number of seconds - Number of milliseconds" durations (+DHHMMSSCCC format)

// Change the time
StartDate.Time = "153050"// Modify the Time part
StartDate.Time = EndTime
```
