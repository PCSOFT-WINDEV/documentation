The **ExtendedInfo** property is used to get additional information:

- about a data file accessed by a Native Connector or HFSQL Client/Server.

- about an item accessed by a Native Connector or HFSQL Client/Server.

- about a connection. In this case, this property is equivalent to the [CtExtendedInfo](../Proprietes/2512017.md) property.




This extended information can be modified for a file, a connection or an item defined through programming.

For more details, see the documentation supplied by the provider of the database.


**Important**: At this time, this property can only be used with AS/400 data files (and items) and with HFSQL Client/Server connections. On HFSQL Client/Server connections, only the encryption can be managed by the **ExtendedInfo** property. 


This information is displayed in the data model editor:

- in the description window of a data file.

- in the description window of the items found in a data file.

- in the description window of a connection: on the "Analysis" tab, in the "Connection" group, click "Connections".




This property can be used:

- in read-only mode for a file or an item defined in the data model editor or through programming.

- in write mode for a data file defined through programming or for a connection.

## Syntax

### Finding out the extended information

`<Extended information> = <Data file/Item/Connection>.ExtendedInfo`
---

**`<Extended information>: (Character string)`**

Extended information about the specified element. The different details are separated by semicolons (';').

**`<Data file/Item/Connection>: (Character string)`**



- Name of the data file used. This name was defined in the data model editor or with the [File Description](../WDLang4/1514065.md) type.

- Name of the item used (format: &lt;Data file name&gt;.&lt;Item name&gt;). This name was defined in the data model editor or with the [Item Description](../WDLang4/1514071.md) type.

- Name of the connection used. This connection can correspond to:

	- a connection defined in the data model editor,

	- a connection defined with [HConnect](../WDLang4/3044263.md), [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

	- a connection defined with a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md).

### Defining the extended information

`<Data file/Item/Connection>.ExtendedInfo = <Extended information>`
---

**`<Data file/Item/Connection>: (Character string)`**



- Name of the data file used. Name defined using the [File Description](../WDLang4/1514065.md) type.

- Name of the item used (format: &lt;Data file name&gt;.&lt;Item name&gt;). Name defined using the [Item Description](../WDLang4/1514071.md) type.

- Name of the connection used. This connection can correspond to:

	- a connection defined in the data model editor,

	- a connection defined with [HConnect](../WDLang4/3044263.md), [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

	- a connection defined with a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md).







**`<Extended information>: (Character string)`**

Extended information about the specified element. The different details must be separated by semicolons (';'). 

Remark: The list of extended information recognized by OLE DB and the Native Connectors is presented in [Optional connection information](../WDLang4/9000124.md).

### **ExtendedInfo** property and Connection variable
<a name="docparampagetitleshort_property_and_connection_variable_ELTPARAGRAPHE000137"></a>

Changing the encryption information of an HFSQL Client/Server connection with the **ExtendedInfo** property automatically updates the information returned by the [Encryption](../Proprietes/2512102.md) property (and vice versa).

Therefore, the following line of code:


```wl
MyConnection.CryptMethod = hCryptRC5_16
```
will modify the ENCRYPTION option in the string of extended information.

Similarly, the following line of code:


```wl
MyConnection.ExtendedInfo = "CRYPT=RC5_16"
```
will modify the [Encryption](../Proprietes/2512102.md) property.
