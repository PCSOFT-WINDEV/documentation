The **Encryption** property allows you to manage the type of encryption used between Client computers and an HFSQL server. You can:

- Find out the type of encryption used for an HFSQL Client/Server connection.

- Define the type of encryption used for the HFSQL Client/Server connection. In this case, if the connection is currently open, it will be closed and opened again with the new parameters when first accessing a data file that uses this connection.




**Remark**: The connection can correspond to:

- a connection defined in the data model editor,

- a connection defined with [HConnect](../WDLang4/3044263.md), [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

- a connection described with a variable of type [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md).

## Example


```wl
MyConnection is Connection
// Describe the connection
MyConnection.User = "USER"
MyConnection.Password = "PASSWORD"
MyConnection.Server = "MYSERVER" 
MyConnection.Database = "Database"
MyConnection.CryptMethod = hCryptRC5_16
MyConnection.Provider = hAccessHFClientServer
MyConnection.Access = hOReadWrite
MyConnection.ExtendedInfo = "Extended information"

HOpenConnection(MyConnection)
```

## Syntax

### Finding out the type of encryption for an HFSQL Client/Server connection

`<Type of encryption> = <Connection used>.Encryption`
---

**`<Type of encryption>: (Constant)`**

Returns the type of encryption used for the connection:  


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hEncryptionAES128* | The connection between the server and the client computers is encrypted using a 128-bit AES encryption algorithm with the OFB mode of operation. |
| *hEncryptionAES192* | The connection between the server and the client computers is encrypted using a 192-bit AES encryption algorithm with the OFB mode of operation.  |
| *hEncryptionAES256* | The connection between the server and the client computers is encrypted using a 256-bit AES encryption algorithm with the OFB mode of operation.  |
| *hEncryptionNO* | No encryption is performed. |
| *hEncryptionRC5_16* | The connection between the server and the client computers is encrypted using an optimized 16-round RC5 encryption algorithm (128 bits). |
| *hEncryptionStandard* | The connection between the server and the client computers is encrypted using an optimized 128-bit encryption algorithm |



**`<Connection used>: (Connection name)`**

Name of the connection used. This name is defined:

- in the data model editor,

- with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md),

- with the [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md) type.

### Defining the type of encryption for a connection

`<Connection used>.Encryption = <Type of encryption>`
---

**`<Connection used>: (Connection name)`**

Name of the connection used. This name is defined:

- in the data model editor,

- with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md),

- with the [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md) type.




**`<Type of encryption>: (Constant)`**

Defines the type of encryption used for the connection:  


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *hEncryptionAES128* | The connection between the server and the client computers is encrypted using a 128-bit AES encryption algorithm with the OFB mode of operation. |
| *hEncryptionAES192* | The connection between the server and the client computers is encrypted using a 192-bit AES encryption algorithm with the OFB mode of operation.  |
| *hEncryptionAES256* | The connection between the server and the client computers is encrypted using a 256-bit AES encryption algorithm with the OFB mode of operation.  |
| *hEncryptionNO* | No encryption is performed. |
| *hEncryptionRC5_16* | The connection between the server and the client computers is encrypted using an optimized 16-round RC5 encryption algorithm (128 bits). |
| *hEncryptionStandard* | The connection between the server and the client computers is encrypted using an optimized 128-bit encryption algorithm. |

### ExtendedInfo property and connection
<a name="extendedinfo_property_and_connection_ELTPARAGRAPHE000185"></a>

Changing the encryption information of an HFSQL Client/Server connection with the [ExtendedInfo](../Proprietes/2512041.md) property automatically updates the information returned by the **Encryption** property (and vice versa).

Therefore, the following line of code:


```wl
MyConnection.CryptMethod = hCryptRC5_16
```
will modify the ENCRYPTION option in the string of extended information.

Similarly, the following line of code:


```wl
MyConnection.ExtendedInfo = "CRYPT=RC5_16"
```
will modify the **Encryption** property.
