The **AutomaticLink** property is used to: 

- determine if the automatic link detection mode is enabled,

- enable or disable the automatic link detection mode. 




This property is available for: 

- multiline Edit controls.. 

- Word Processing controls.




**When this property is enabled for an Edit control**, links are automatically displayed as clickable links. The following links are taken into account:

- URLs. For example, "http://www.windev.com".

- full paths or UNC paths to a file. For example, "C:\\temp\\MyImages.bmp". The link is displayed only if the file exists.

<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=LienAutomatique.gif)
When the user clicks this link, the corresponding file is automatically displayed ([ShellExecute](../WDLang1/3035007.md) is automatically executed with the text of the link as parameter). The click can be intercepted by the WM_USER + 853 event (see the Notes).
To select the link (without opening the document), all you have to do is press the Ctrl key.

**When this property is enabled for a Word Processing control**, links are detected during input, after pressing Space, Tab or Enter. If these links already exist, they can be opened with Ctrl + Click.

**Remark**: This property is equivalent to: 

- the "Display and enable the links" option in the "Details" tab of the Edit control description window.

- the "Automatically detect and format links" option in the "General" tab of the Word Processing control description window.

## Remarks


### Intercepting the click performed on a link in an edit control
<a name="intercepting_the_click_performed_link_edit_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000106"></a>

You can intercept the click performed by the user on a link found in an edit control. Simply:

1. Declare the event process in the initialization code of the window (WM_USER + 853 in this case).
	
	```wl
	Event("proc_click", "*.*", WM_USER + 853)
	```


2. Create the procedure called by [Event](../WDLang1/3015011.md). The content of this procedure will be run before starting the application associated with the link.

### Limitation

UNC links in an Edit control: The link is not entirely displayed if the path contains a space character. The link should be enclosed in quotes.
