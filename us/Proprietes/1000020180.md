## Remarks


### Operating mode of ads
<a name="operating_mode_ads_ELTPARAGRAPHE000040"></a>

An ad is automatically loaded in the Ad control when the window is opened. 

Then, new ads can be regularly loaded in the control according to the refresh rate defined in the application setting on the AdMob site. 

The ads are loaded in background task from Internet. Therefore, the device must be connected in order for the ads to be displayed. A timeout (few seconds to several minutes) may be required between the opening of the window and the actual display of the first ad. This timeout depends on the connection quality and on the ad size. 

We recommend that you use the events "Loading an ad" and "Error while loading an ad" to check the display of ads in the control.
