The **OriginWaypoint** property is used to get and define the origin of points whose coordinates are specified in the [WayPoint](../Proprietes/1000021957.md) property. 
<a name="Example1"></a>
<a name="sample_code"></a>

## Example


```wl
// The Wire control goes through the STC_Center control
WIRE_MyWire.OriginWaypoint = wireOriginWindow  
pt1 is Point = [STC_Center.X, STC_Center.Y]
WIRE_MyWire.WayPoint = [pt1]
```

### Identifying the origin of points specified in the WayPoint property

`<Result> = <Wire control>.OriginWaypoint`
---

**`<Result>: (Integer constant)`**

Current origin taken into account for the coordinates of the points: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *wireOriginStartControl* | The coordinates are relative to the top left point of start control for the Wire control. |
| *wireOriginStartPoint* | The coordinates are relative to the start point of the Wire control. |
| *wireOriginWindow* | The coordinates are relative to the origin of the window. <br><br>Remark: This constant forces the Wire control to go through a fixed position even if the control is moved. |



**`<Wire control>: (Control name)`**

Name of the Wire control to use.

### Modifying the mandatory waypoints for a Wire control

`<Wire control>.WayPoint = <New Origin>`
---

**`<Wire control>: (Control name)`**

Name of the Wire control to be used

**`<New Origin>: (Integer constant)`**

New origin taken into account for the coordinates of the points: 



|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| *wireOriginStartControl* | The coordinates are relative to the top left point of start control for the Wire control. |
| *wireOriginStartPoint* | The coordinates are relative to the start point of the Wire control. |
| *wireOriginWindow* | The coordinates are relative to the origin of the window. <br><br>Remark: This constant forces the Wire control to go through a fixed position even if the control is moved. |
