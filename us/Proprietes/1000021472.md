**`<Result>: (Buffer)`**

Buffer containing the entire style of the control. This buffer can for example: 

- be used to copy the style from a control to another one. 

- be saved in a file or in a memo item in order to restore the style afterwards. 




**`<Control used>: (Control name)`**

**`<Control used>: (Control name)`**

Name of the control to be used.

**`<New style>: (Buffer)`**

Buffer containing the new entire style  of the control. 

**Caution**: 

- The style used must correspond to the style of a control of the same type. Otherwise, a WLanguage error occurs. 

- If the style uses images, these images must be located in the WDL or accessible on the disk.
