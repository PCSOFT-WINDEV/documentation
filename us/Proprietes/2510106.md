The **PageNumber** property is used to: 

- ![WINDEV](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/ext/images/us/WD.png) get and change the number of the page displayed in an Image control ("multi-page" image files).

- get and change the page number of a PDF file displayed in an Image control of a window. 

- get and change the page number of a PDF file displayed in the background of a report. 




**Reminder**: Some image formats (TIFF for example) can contain several images in the same file. Each image corresponds to a file page. These formats are called "multi-page" formats.

Remark: To get and change the number of the page displayed in a Word Processing or PDF Reader control, use the [NumberDisplayedPage](../Proprietes/1000023479.md) property.

## Remarks


### Modifying the page displayed in an Image control
<a name="modifying_the_page_displayed_image_control_ELTPARAGRAPHE000072"></a>

When an image or PDF file is associated with a control (from the window editor, via the [Image](../Proprietes/2510034.md) property, etc.), the image displayed by default corresponds to the first page of the "multi-page" file.

To change the page displayed in the Image control, simply use the **PageNumber** property.

**Caution**: The **PageNumber** property applies only to the image file currently associated with the Image control.

### Changing the page of the PDF file displayed in the background of a report
<a name="changing_the_page_the_pdf_file_displayed_the_background_report_ELTPARAGRAPHE000090"></a>

If a PDF file is used as report form, you have the ability to choose (in the report description) the page of the PDF file that will be displayed ("Background" tab, "# of PDF page" option). To programmatically change the page displayed at in the background of the report, simply use the **PageNumber** property.

**Caution**: The **PageNumber** property applies only to the image file currently used as report form.

<a name="number_pages_found_multipage_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000103"></a>

### Drawing in an Image control associated with a "multi-page" image
<a name="drawing_image_control_associated_with_multipage_image_ELTPARAGRAPHE000115"></a>

If a drawing (made with [drawing functions](../WDLang1/3029033.md)) is made in the Image control, this drawing will be automatically deleted when the page displayed with the **PageNumber** property is modified.

This drawing must be re-drawn whenever the page displayed in the image control is modified. To re-draw this drawing, we recommend that you use a procedure.
