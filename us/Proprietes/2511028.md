### What is a query performed on a connection?
<a name="what_query_performed_connection_ELTPARAGRAPHE000010"></a>

A [query performed on a connection](../WDChamp/1011066.md) is a query performed on data files handled via a specific ODBC driver or a Native Connector.

When the connection is created, you can define: 

- the connection name

- the name of the data source

- the username and password

- the name of the database accessed (if there is more than one). 


The report editor allows you to print the data coming from a query performed on a connection. All the parameters of the connection to use can be defined in the report editor or through programming with the WLanguage properties.

**ODBCSQLCode** is used to:

- Find out the SQL code of the "query performed on a connection" (data source of report). This query is performed on one or more data files accessible via a specific ODBC driver or a Native Connector. This query is defined during the report creation.

- Modify the SQL code of the "query performed on a connection" (data source of report).




**Remark**: This property must be used in the opening code of the report.

## Example


```wl
// -- Opening code of the report
RPT_Report1.ODBCConnectionName = "MyConnection"
RPT_Report1.ODBCSQLCode = "Select * from Products"
RPT_Report1.ODBCUserName = "MOORE"
RPT_Report1.ODBCPassword = "PSW"
```

## Syntax

### Finding out the code of the "Query performed on a connection"

`<Result> = <Report used>.ODBCSQLCode`
---

**`<Result>: (Character string)`**

Text of the SQL query to be executed on the database accessed via a specific ODBC driver or a Native Connector. This query must be a Select query (SELECT).

**`<Report used>: (Report name)`**

Name of the report to be used.  


<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Modifying the code of the "Query performed on a connection"

`<Report used>.ODBCSQLCode = <New SQL code>`
---

**`<Report used>: (Report name)`**

Name of the report to be used.

**`<New SQL code>: (Character string)`**

SQL code of the query to be executed. The SQL code must be recognized by the database used. This query must be a Select query (SELECT).
