### Modifying the speed at which the control is reduced when scrolling the scrollbar

`<Control used>.ParallaxRateHeight = <New speed>`
---

**`<Control used>: (Control name)`**

Name of the control used. 

**`<New speed>: (Integer)`**

Speed at which the control is reduced (included between 0 and 1000). This parameter is set to 0 by default. 

- If this parameter is set to 0, the control moves as usual when scrolling the window or the page. 

- If this parameter is set to 1000, the control is crushed down as the scroll performed in the window or page goes along.
