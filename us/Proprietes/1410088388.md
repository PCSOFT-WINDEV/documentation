The **spIterationCount** property is used to:

- Get the iteration count of the hash algorithm used for an item of type "Password". This property can be used for items of type "Password" defined in the data model editor or programmatically. 

- Set the iteration count of the hash algorithm used for an item of type "Password" (only for "Password" items described programmatically).

## Example


```wl
// Describe the AFile file
...

// Describe the "Password" item
MyItem is Item Description
MyItem.Name = "Password"
MyItem.Type = hItemSecurePassword
MyItem.spDerivation = SP_PBKDF2
MyItem.spHash = SP_SHA2_256
MyItem.spIterationCount = 20000
MyItem.spLength = 256

// Validate the description of the "Password" item
HDescribeItem(AFile, MyItem)

// Validate the description of AFile file
...
```

## Syntax

### Getting the iteration count of the hash algorithm used for an item of type "Password"

`<Iterations> = <Data file>.<Item>.spIterationCount`
---

**`<Iterations>: (Integer)`**

Number of iterations of the hash algorithm used.

**`<Data file>: (Character string)`**

Name of the file used. This name was defined in the data model editor or with the [File Description](../WDLang4/1514065.md) type.

**`<Item>: (Character string)`**

Name of the item used. This name was defined in the data model editor or with the [Item Description](../WDLang4/1514071.md) type.  


<a name="SYNTAX2"></a>

### Setting the iteration count of the hash algorithm used for an item of type "Password" (described programmatically)

`<Item>.spIterationCount = <Iterations>`
---

**`<Item>: (Character string)`**

Name of the item used. This name was defined by the [Item Description](../WDLang4/1514071.md) type.

**`<Iterations>: (Integer)`**

Number of iterations of the hash algorithm used. It is recommended to set a value between 10,000 and 30,000
