The **BackgroundImageState** property allows you to get and change the number of drawings in the image associated with the background of a Button control.

**Remarks**:

- Each drawing in the image corresponds to the state of a button. The drawings must follow a specific order: Normal, Pressed, Grayed, Focus and Rollover.

- The number of drawings found in an image is defined in the window editor, in the "General" tab of the control description.
