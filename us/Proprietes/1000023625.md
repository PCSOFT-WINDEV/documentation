The **CriticalSection** keyword can correspond to:

- the [CriticalSection](../WDLang1/1000024373.md) function, which is used to enable a named or on-variable critical section in a [USING ... IN](../Motscles/1510025.md) statement.

- \* the [CriticalSection](../WDLang1/1000023972.md) variable type, which makes it possible to define critical sections to limit the simultaneous execution of a code (procedure, line of code, etc.) **to one thread** at a given moment in an application.
