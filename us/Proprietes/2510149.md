The **MovableByBackground** property is used to:

- finding out whether a window can be moved by the background, 

- allowing (or not) a window to be moved by the background.




**Remarks**:

- When movable by background is enabled, the user can move the window with the mouse. To do so, click the window background and keep the mouse button down until the window is dragged to the requested location.

- This property corresponds to the "Move by background " option in the "UI" tab of the window description.
