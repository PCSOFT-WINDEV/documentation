The **CacheSize** property is used to:

- Get the maximum number of records that can be stored in the cache of the Native MySQL Connector.

- Change the maximum number of records that can be stored in the cache of the Native MySQL Connector. In this case, if the connection is currently opened, it will be closed and reopened with the new parameters during the first access to a file that uses this connection.




**Remark**: The connection can correspond to:

- a connection described in the data model editor,

- a connection described by [HConnect](../WDLang4/3044263.md), [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

- a connection described by a [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md) variable.

## Syntax

### Getting the cache size for a connection

`<Cache size> = <Connection used>.CacheSize`
---

**`<Cache size>: (Integer)`**

Cache size of the Native MySQL Connector.

If this parameter corresponds to:

- -2: the cache size is the default size (100 for the Native MySQL Connector).

- -1: the cache size is unlimited.

- 0: the cache stores no record. No record is retrieved.




**`<Connection used>: (Character string or Connection variable)`**

Name of the connection used. This name was defined:

- in the data model editor,

- by [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md),

- by the [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md) type.

### Defining the cache size for a connection

`<Connection used>.CacheSize = <Cache size>`
---

**`<Connection used>: (Character string or Connection variable)`**

Name of the connection used. This name was defined:

- in the data model editor,

- by [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md),

- by the [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md) type.




**`<Cache size>: (Integer)`**

New cache size of the Native MySQL Connector.

If this parameter corresponds to:

- -2: the cache size will be the default size (100 for the Native MySQL Connector).

- -1: the cache size will be unlimited.

- 0: the cache will store no record. No record will be retrieved.

## Remarks


### Equivalence
<a name="equivalence_ELTPARAGRAPHE000101"></a>

[CtCacheSize](../Proprietes/2512027.md) is used to define the cache size for a MySQL connection. This property is kept for backward compatibility. It is recommended to use the **CacheSize** property.
<a name="NOTE0_2"></a>


### Retrieving the records
<a name="retrieving_the_records_ELTPARAGRAPHE000112"></a>

The speed at which the entire set of records is retrieved is proportional to the cache size: the larger the cache size, the faster the records are retrieved.

However, the smaller the cache size, the faster the first record will be read.

**Caution**: The memory used by the cache is proportional to the cache size.

### Managing the CacheSize property
<a name="managing_the_docparampagetitleshort_property_ELTPARAGRAPHE000125"></a>

The **CacheSize** property is supported only by the Native MySQL Connector.

Other Native Connectors do not support the **CacheSize** property. In this case, the use of this property will be ignored and no error will be generated.

### hQueryWithoutCorrection constant
<a name="hquerywithoutcorrection_constant_ELTPARAGRAPHE000140"></a>

If the query is run while no check is performed on the SQL code (*hQueryWithoutCorrection* constant): the size is unlimited and cannot be changed with the **CacheSize** property.
