The **Server** property is used to manage the data source of a connection (HFSQL Client/Server, OLE DB, etc.). You can:

- Find out the data source used for a connection (HFSQL Client/Server, OLE DB, ...).

- Define the data source used for the connection (HFSQL Client/Server, OLE DB, ...). In this case, if the connection is currently opened, it will be closed and reopened with the new parameters during the first access to a file that uses this connection.




Caution: if you are using a remote database and if you are using an Internet connection to access it, the entry port of the router must be redirected onto the HFSQL server. For more details, see [Managing ports](../WDLang4/3044334.md).

**Remark**: The connection can correspond to:

- a connection described in the data model editor,

- a connection described by [HConnect](../WDLang4/3044263.md), [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).

- a connection described by a [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md) variable.

## Example


```wl
MyConnection is Connection
// Describe the connection
MyConnection.User = "USER"
MyConnection.Password = "PASSWORD"
MyConnection.Server = "MYSERVER" 
MyConnection.Database = "Database"
MyConnection.Provider = hAccessHFClientServer
MyConnection.Access = hOReadWrite
MyConnection.ExtendedInfo = "Extended information"
MyConnection.CursorOptions = hClientCursor

HOpenConnection(MyConnection)
```

## Syntax

### Finding out the data source of the connection

`<Data source> = <Connection used>.Server`
---

**`<Data source>: (Character string)`**



- Name of the server (for HFSQL Client/Server, SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, etc.)

- Name of the file used as data source (for Access, XML, xBase, etc.)




**`<Connection used>: (Character string or Connection variable)`**

Name of the connection used. This name was defined:

- in the data model editor,

- by [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md),

- by the [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md) type.

### Defining the data source of the connection

`<Connection used>.Server = <Data source>`
---

**`<Connection used>: (Character string or Connection variable)`**

Name of the connection used. This name was defined:

- in the data model editor,

- by [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md),

- by the [Connection](../WDLang4/1514073.md) type.




**`<Data source>: (Character string)`**



- Name or IP address of the server (for HFSQL Client/Server, SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, ...)

- Name of the file used as data source (for Access, XML, xBase, etc.)

<a name="NOTE0_1"></a>

## Remarks
The **Server** and [Source](../Proprietes/2510147.md) properties are equivalent.

These two properties are kept to make the code easier to understand. In the HFSQL Client/Server, SQL Server, Oracle or MySQL connection, the **Server** property is recommended because it is necessary to specify a server name.

However, in an Access, XML or xBase connection, it is recommended to use the [Source](../Proprietes/2510147.md) property because it is necessary to specify a data file.
