## Syntax

`<Type of cursor> = <File name/connection>.CtCursorOptions`
---

**`<Type of cursor>: (Integer constant)`**

Returns the type of cursor used. This parameter can correspond to one or more of the following constants: 


|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| **Location of cursors** |
| *hClientCursor* | Cursor managed by MDAC. Offers more features than a server cursor. A client cursor must necessarily be a static cursor. |
| *hServerCursor* | Cursor managed by the database. This cursor can easily apply the changes performed by the other users to the data. |
| **Type of cursor** |
| *hDynamicCursor* | Cursor offering a lot of features but consuming a lot of memory. This cursor allows all types of moves. It allows you to access all the modifications, additions and deletions performed by the other users. |
| *hForwardOnlyCursor* | Fast cursor consuming little memory. The move is performed from the first record to the last one. The data modified by the other users is not visible. |
| *hOpenKeysetCursor* | Cursor that handles a fixed set of records. Only the keys corresponding to the record are stored and not the records (consumes less memory). The deleted records can no longer be accessed. Modifications performed by other users are visible (but records added are not). |
| *hStaticCursor* | Makes a copy of all query records in memory (consumes a lot of memory). All types of moves are allowed. |
| **Lock modes** |
| *hReadOnlyCursor* | The set of records cannot be modified. |
| *hOptimisticCursor* | The record is locked when it is updated |
| *hPessimisticCursor* | The record is locked as soon as it goes into edit mode to be modified. |

**Remark**: If no constant was specified in [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md), this parameter is set to 0.

**Caution**: some types of cursors may not be supported by all the OLE DB providers.

**`<File name/connection>: (Character string)`**



- Name of the data file used. This name was defined in the data model editor or with the [File Description](../WDLang4/1514065.md) type.

- Name of the connection used. This name was defined in the data model editor, or with [HDescribeConnection](../WDLang4/3044205.md) or [HOpenConnection](../WDLang4/3044107.md).
