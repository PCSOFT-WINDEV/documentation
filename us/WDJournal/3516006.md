## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000361"></a>
WDLog allows you to save all the HFSQL data files used by a WINDEV or WEBDEV application.

The following file is required to perform this backup:

- the analysis file (.WDD), 

- the .REP file that contains the different paths of the data files managed by the project.




This backup can be performed:

- In interactive mode (WDLog is started).

- In "Command line" mode. The "Command line" mode allows you to include the management of file backups in your applications. In this case, no specific operation must be performed by the user.




**Important**: Don't forget to write down the references of all the backups performed (date of backup, directory of backup, nature of backup, diskette containing the files or the logs, ...). This information is fundamental when restoring the files.

### Saving the HFSQL data files associated with an analysis
<a name="saving_the_hfsql_data_files_associated_with_analysis_ELTPARAGRAPHE000032"></a>

To save the HFSQL data files associated with an analysis: 

1. Start WDLog.

2. Select "Backups .. Save the data" (or click the orange arrow).

3. With the "Browse" button, select:

	- The analysis file (.WDD) that contains the description of data files managed by the project.

	- The .REP file that contains the different paths of the data files managed by the project.




4. The list of data files found in the application .REP is displayed. In this list, you can:

	- Delete files (.FIC, .MMO or .NDX files) with the "Remove" button.

	- Add HFSQL data files (.FIC, .MMO or .NDX files) with the "Other" button.

	- Save the list of data files in a "List" file (LST extension) with the "Save" button. This list file can be read by WDLog or used in command line. 
			Caution: The "list" file is not cleared whenever a backup is performed.

	- Open a list of data files with the "Open" button.




5. Click the "OK" button to validate the backup of data files.

6. Specify the following elements in the backup window:

	- Backup directory: Directory in which the backup directory will be created.

	- Backup name: Name of the directory where the backup will be performed.

	- Specify the backup options:

		- ***Don't create a subdirectory named like the backup***: The backup directory is not created.

		- ***Compression***: used to compress the files during backup. This option is used to reduce the storage size of backups. A single archive file (WDZ) will be created. 
						If this option is not checked, the files will only be copied into the backup directory.

		- ***Multi-volumes***: used to compress the files during the backup and to group the files in archives (1.4 MB). This option is recommended if the backup must be performed on diskettes. This option automatically enables the "Compression" mode.

		- ***Don't save the indexes (.NDX)***: used to reduce the size of the backup. If this option is checked, the files must be reindexed once they have been restored. 
						Reminder: Several methods are available to reindex the data files: WDTOOL (cannot be redistributed), WDOptimizer, WDMAP (cannot be redistributed), or through programming with **HIndex**.

		- ***Don't lock the files***: allows saving files even if they are in use. This option is not recommended because the backup may contain locked records that can no longer be accessed. 
						This option is recommended in some specific cases, for the applications started in background task that open files but that do not use the transactions for example, ... This option can also be used with applications that handle independent data files (not linked in the analysis).




7. Click the "OK" button to start the backup.

## Command Line mode
<a name="command_line_mode_ELTTEXTE000415"></a>
Two types of backups are available in command line mode:

- Saving all the data files described either in an analysis, or in the .REP file of the application.

- Saving a list of data files.




See the previous paragraph ("Interactive mode") for more details.

**Remark**: A WDLOG.LOG file is automatically created. This file contains the operations performed.

### Saving all the data files found in a WDD file or in a .REP file
<a name="saving_all_the_data_files_found_wdd_file_rep_file_ELTPARAGRAPHE000087"></a>

The following syntax allows you to save all the data files found in a WDD file or in a .REP file:


```txt
WDLog /APPLI=<FullWDDName or FullREPName>
/REP = <BackupDir>
/COMPRESS = <True/False>
/MUET = <True/False>
/MULTI = <True/False>

/SANSINDEX = <True/False>
/SANSSOUSREP = <True/False>
```


Details of parameters:

| Parameter | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| /APPLI = &lt;FullWDDName or FullREPName&gt; | Character string containing the full name of the analysis (".WDD" file) or the full name of the ".REP" file of the application. |
| /REP=&lt;BackupDir&gt; | Path where the files will be saved |
| /COMPRESS=&lt;True/False&gt; | The data files will be compressed if this option is set to "True". The files will be saved in an archive (.WDZ file).<br>Otherwise, the files will not be compressed.<br>This option is set to "True" by default. |
| /MUET=&lt;True/False&gt; | If this option corresponds to "True", if a locking error occurs, all the operations performed will be written into a result file (.LOG file). The execution of WDLog will not be locked.<br>Otherwise, a window will be displayed if an error occurs.<br>This option is set to "False" by default. |
| /MULTI=&lt;True/False&gt; | The backup archive will be divided into files (1.4 MB) if this option is set to "True". There is no need to specify the compression option if this option is used.<br>Otherwise, the archive will not be divided.<br>This option is set to "False" by default. |
| /SANSBLOCAGE=&lt;True/False&gt; | Only the data files that are not locked will be saved if this option is set to "True".<br>Otherwise, all the data files will be saved.<br>This option is set to "False" by default. |
| /SANSINDEX=&lt;True/False&gt; | The indexes of the data files will not be saved if this option is set to "True".<br>Otherwise, the indexes will be saved.<br>This option is set to "False" by default. |
| /SANSSOUSREP=&lt;True/False&gt; | The backup subdirectory will not be created if this option is set to "True". The backup will be performed in the &lt;BackupDir&gt; directory.<br>Otherwise, a backup subdirectory will be created.<br>This option is set to "False" by default. |


**Example**: The following command line is used to save all the files found in "C:\\MyProject\\MyAnalysis.WDD" into "D:\\Project Backup". These files will be compressed. The index files will not be saved.

**Caution**: If the names of directories contain space characters, the parameter must be enclosed in quotes.

ExeRun("WDLog /APPLI= C:\MyProject\MyAnalysis.WDD " + ...
	"/REP=""D:\Backup of my projects"" /COMPRESS=True /SANSINDEX=True")

### Saving all the data files found in a list
<a name="saving_all_the_data_files_found_list_ELTPARAGRAPHE000251"></a>

To save a list of data files, create a text file containing the different physical names of the files to save. This file can be created by WDLog run in interactive mode.

The command line is as follows:


```txt
WDLog /LISTE = <FileName>
          /REP = <BackupDir>
          /COMPRESS = True
          /MUET = True
          /MULTI = True
          /SANSBLOCAGE = True
          /SANSINDEX = True
          /SANSSOUSREP = True
```


The table below presents the different elements that can be found on the command line:

| Parameter | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| /LISTE = &lt;FileName&gt; | Name of the file containing the list of data files to save. This text file contains one file name per line. It can be created by WDLog ("Save" button).<br>Example:<br>  E:\\WD Stock Chart\\Exe\\Action.FIC  <br><br><br>Name of the file containing the list of data files to save.
