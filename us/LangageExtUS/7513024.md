## Remarks


- **Library, Disk** must be called before HInit and Project.
	A library is created by the editor of WINDEV and its extension is WDL. A single library can be opened at a given time.
	The style sheet of project is loaded by the function:
	Project,&lt;project_name&gt;

- **Library,Disk** is called with the "/CR" parameter:

	- If an error occurred when opening the library:

		- The status code "\*E\*" is returned in the WdKey variable (WDKey in C)

		- WdInt (WDEntier in C) contains a non-existing file, an invalid library and an insufficient memory.




- If no error occurred when opening the library:

	- WdInt (WDInt in C) contains 0

	- WdKey (WDKey in C) returns an empty string.
