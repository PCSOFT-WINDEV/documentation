## How to create an archive?
<a name="how_create_archive_ELTTEXTE000255"></a>
To create an archive:

1. Start WDZIP: on the "Tools" tab, in the "Utilities" group, click "WDZip". The WDZip window is displayed:<br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=WDZip%20-%20HC%20N%B0001.gif&type=thumb)


2. Click the "New" button or select "File .. New archive...".  A file picker is displayed.

3. Type the name of archive to create and click "Save". By default, the extension of created archive will be ".WDZ". To create an archive in ZIP, CAB or 7z format, the extension must be specified in the file name.

## How to add files into an archive?
<a name="how_add_files_into_archive_ELTTEXTE000279"></a>
To add one or more files into an archive: 

1. Open (if necessary) the archive into which the files must be added (click the "Open" button or select "File .. Open an archive".

2. Click the "Add" button or select "Action .. Add a file".

3. Select the files to add. 
	Reminder: To select several files simultaneously, keep the Ctrl key down when selecting files.

4. Choose the backup mode of tree structure for the files to archive. The backup modes of tree structure are as follows:

	- Keep the tree structure: the files will be archived with their relative tree structure (*&lt;Directories...&gt; + &lt;File&gt;*).

	- Include the system files and the hidden files: used to archive the system files and the hidden files.

	- Store the absolute path: the files will be archived with their full tree structure (*&lt;Disk&gt; + &lt;Directories...&gt; + &lt;File&gt;*)

	- Protect by password: the password will have to be specified before any operation can be performed on the files (replacement, extraction, ...)




5. Specify (if necessary) the requested compression level (0 for no compression, 9 for a maximum compression). 

6. Validate.




Remarks:

- To add files into an archive, you also have the ability to perform a Drag and Drop from the explorer to **WDZip**. In this case, the added files are automatically archived with their tree structure.

- The percentage of file compression (size of compressed files compared to their initial size) is indicated beside the name of files.

- The files can only be added into a single-part archive. To perform this operation on a multi-part archive, the sub-archives must be merged in order to create a single-part archive.

## How to add directories into an archive?
<a name="how_add_directories_into_archive_ELTTEXTE000303"></a>
To add a directory into an archive:

1. Open (if necessary) the archive into which the files must be added (click the "Open" button or select "File .. Open an archive".

2. Click the "Add" button or select "Action .. Add a file".

3. Select the directory to add and click the "Open" button. 

4. Choose the backup mode of the tree structure for the files found in the directory to archive. The backup modes of tree structure are as follows:

	- Keep the tree structure: the files found in the directory will be archived with their relative tree structure (*&lt;Directories...&gt; + &lt;File>*).

	- Include the system files and the hidden files: used to archive the system files and the hidden files found in the directory.

	- Store the absolute path: the files found in the directory will be archived with their full tree structure (*&lt;Disk&gt; + &lt;Directories...&gt; + &lt;File&gt;*)

	- Protect by password: the password will have to be specified before any operation can be performed on the files found in the directory (replacement, extraction, ...)




5. Select the directories to add. 
	**Reminder**: To select several directories, keep the Ctrl key down while selecting directories

6. Validate.




Remarks:

- To add directories into an archive, you also have the ability to perform a Drag and Drop from the explorer to **WDZip**. In this case, the directories and their sub-folders are saved with their relative tree structure.

- The directories can only be added into a single-part archive. To perform this operation on a multi-part archive, the sub-archives must be merged in order to create a single-part archive.

## Splitting and merging an archive
<a name="splitting_and_merging_archive_ELTTEXTE000327"></a>
A multi-file archive contains several files (or sub-archives) of identical size. The size of each sub-archive is defined when creating the multi-file archive. For more details, see [Single-part/Multi-part archive](../WDLang3/3082015.md).

From a multi-part archive, you can only:

- Merge the different parts, 

- Extract the files.




**Splitting an archive into several sub-archives**: 

1. Open (if necessary) the archive to split (click the "Open" button or select "File .. Open an archive".

2. Click the "Split" button or select "Action .. Split the archive".

3. The window for configuring the splitting of the archive is displayed.

4. Set the size of the sub-archives (the suggested size ranges from 360 KB to 64 MB). 
	Remark: If you select "Other", enter the size of the archive in kilobytes or in megabytes according to the selected option. 
	Caution: The size of the sub-archives cannot be less than 360 KB.

5. If the original "WDZ" or "ZIP" file must be deleted after splitting the archive, check "Delete the source archive after the split operation".

6. Validate.




For the archives in WDZ format: The first sub-archive is a ".WDZ" file. The following sub-archives are files numbered from 1 to N via their extension (".001", ".002", ..., ".NNN").

For the archives in ZIP format: The first sub-archive is a ".ZIP" file. The following sub-archives are files numbered from 1 to N via their extension (".Z01", ".Z02", ..., ".ZNN").

**Remark**: Some archiving features can only be used on the single-part archives (adding files, deleting files, creating a self-extracting executable, ...). To use these features, you must [merge the archive into a single-part archive](../WDZip/3527003.md).
<a name="NOTE5_2"></a>
A single-part archive contains a single ".WDZ" file: an archive file groups all the compressed files.

The archive occupies the necessary space to contain all the compressed files.

**To merge a multi-part archive into a single-part archive**: 

1. Open (if necessary) the first file of the multi-part archive (click the "Open" button or select "File .. Open an archive"). The extension of this archive is ".WDZ" or ".ZIP".

2. Select "Action .. Merge the archives".

3. The merged archive is now a single-part archive.

## Self-extracting archive
<a name="selfextracting_archive_ELTTEXTE000357"></a>


### Create a self-extracting archive
<a name="create_selfextracting_archive_ELTPARAGRAPHE000168"></a>

A self-extracting archive is an executable (".EXE" file). When this executable is run, the files found in the archive are automatically decompressed on the current computer.

A self-extracting archive can be created if:

- The archive exists.

- The archive is accessible in read/write.

- The archive is a single-part archive.




**To create a self-extracting archive**:

1. Open (if necessary) the archive that must be converted into self-extracting archive (click the "Open" button or select "File .. Open an archive".

2. Click the "Executable" button or select "Action .. Create a self-extracting archive".

3. Specify the directory where the files must be decompressed when the executable is run.

4. Specify whether a dialog box must be displayed during the extraction. This dialog box allows the user to choose the extraction path for example.

5. Validate. The self-extracting archive is created.
