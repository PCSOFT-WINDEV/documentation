<a name="NOTE1_1"></a>


## Reason
<a name="reason_ELTTEXTE000099"></a>
You are trying to declare two structures with the same name in the same process.

<a name="NOTE2"></a>
<a name="NOTE2_1"></a>


## Correction
<a name="correction_ELTTEXTE000123"></a>
Rename one of the structures or delete the useless declaration.

<a name="NOTE3"></a>
<a name="NOTE3_1"></a>


## Examples
<a name="examples_ELTTEXTE000147"></a>


### Two structures with the same name are declared in the same process
<a name="two_structures_with_the_same_name_are_declared_the_same_process_ELTPARAGRAPHE000025"></a>

**Code triggering the error**


```wl
Point_Coord is structure
	x,y are int
END
 
...
 
Point_Coord is structure
	x,y are int
END
```




**Possible correction**

Delete the second structure (useless declaration).


```wl
Point_Coord is structure
	x,y are int
END
```

<a name="NOTE3_2"></a>


### Two structures with the same name but using different members are found in the same process
<a name="two_structures_with_the_same_name_but_using_different_members_are_found_the_same_process_ELTPARAGRAPHE000041"></a>

**Code triggering the error**


```wl
Point_Coord is structure
	x,y are int
END
 
...
 
Point_Coord is structure
	Coord_x,Coord_y are real
END
```




**Possible correction**

Delete the second declaration (that is useless).


```wl
Point_Coord is structure
	x,y are int
END
 
...
 
Image_Point_Coord is structure
	Coord_x,Coord_y are real
END
