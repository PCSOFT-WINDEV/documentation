<a name="NOTE1"></a>
<a name="NOTE1_1"></a>


## Reason
<a name="reason_ELTTEXTE000092"></a>
You are trying to access a private class member from a code other than a class code.

**Reminder**: A private member can be handled from a code of the class only.

<a name="NOTE2"></a>
<a name="NOTE2_1"></a>


## Correction
<a name="correction_ELTTEXTE000116"></a>
Two possibilities:

- Replace the private member by:

	- A **constant protected member**: The value of the member can be read and modified from inside the class and the value of the member can be read from a derived class. The access to the member will be forbidden from any other section of the code.

	- A **constant public member**: The value of this member can be read and modified from inside the class or from a derived class. You will only be able to read the value of the member from any other section of the code.

	- A **public member**: The access to the member will not be restricted.




- Do not handle this private member from one of the project codes.




<a name="NOTE3"></a>
<a name="NOTE3_1"></a>


## Example

### Using a private member in the click code of a button
<a name="using_private_member_the_click_code_button_ELTPARAGRAPHE000034"></a>

**Code triggering the error** 


```wl
// -- Declare the class
Drawing is class
	 PRIVATE
	BaseColor is int	 // Color
END
 
// -- Click code of a button 
IF Drawing::BaseColor = LightRed THEN 
...
```




**Possible correction**

Use a constant public member.


```wl
// -- Declare the class
Drawing is class
	PUBLIC CONSTANT
	BaseColor is int	 // Color
END
 
// -- Click code of a button 
IF Drawing::BaseColor = LightRed THEN
...
```
