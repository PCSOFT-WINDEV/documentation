<a name="NOTE1"></a>
<a name="NOTE1_1"></a>
A variable was declared: a global variable with the same name already exists in the current window or project.

If you keep this name, the "global" variable will no longer be visible in the current process: the local variable will be used instead.

Caution: If a variable global to the project is redefined in the initialization code of the window, the new variable will be used in all the processes of the window and window controls.

**Reminder**: Scope of variables

- The global variables declared in the initialization code of the project are visible in the entire project. 

- The global variables declared in the opening code of the windows are visible in all the processes of the window and window controls. 




<a name="NOTE2"></a>
<a name="NOTE2_1"></a>


## Tip
<a name="tip_ELTTEXTE000097"></a>
Avoid using the same identifiers for different variables.
