<a name="NOTE1"></a>
<a name="NOTE1_1"></a>


## Reason
<a name="reason_ELTTEXTE000091"></a>
You are trying to modify a constant member of the class.

**Reminder**: A constant member is accessible in read-only. A member can be:

- **Protected constant**: The value of the member can be read and modified from inside the class and the value of the member can be read from a derived class. The access to the member will be forbidden from any other section of the code.

- **Public constant**: The value of this member can be read and modified from inside the class or from a derived class. You will only be able to read the value of the member from any other section of the code.




<a name="NOTE2"></a>
<a name="NOTE2_1"></a>


## Correction
<a name="correction_ELTTEXTE000115"></a>
Two possibilities:

- Replace the constant member by a **public member**: the access to the member will not be restricted.

- Do not handle the constant member in read/write mode.




<a name="NOTE3"></a>
<a name="NOTE3_1"></a>


## Example

### Using a constant member in the click code of a button

**Code triggering the error** 


```wl
// -- Declare the class
Drawing is class
	PUBLIC CONSTANT
	BaseColor is int	 // Color
END
 
// -- Click code of a button 
Drawing::BaseColor = LightRed
...
```




**Possible correction**

Use a public member.


```wl
// -- Declare the class
Drawing is class
	PUBLIC
	BaseColor is int	 // Color
END
 
// -- Click code of a button 
Drawing::BaseColor = LightRed
...
```
