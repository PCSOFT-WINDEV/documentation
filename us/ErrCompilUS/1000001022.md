<a name="NOTE1"></a>
<a name="NOTE1_1"></a>


## Reason
<a name="reason_ELTTEXTE000068"></a>
You are trying to access a member of a class previously derived by protected inheritance. This member cannot be accessed from a code external to the derived class (or from a code external to its own derived classes).

<a name="NOTE2"></a>
<a name="NOTE2_1"></a>


## Correction
<a name="correction_ELTTEXTE000092"></a>
Two possibilities: 

- Access this member from a method of the derived class or from a method of one of its own derived classes. 

- Transform the protected inheritance to public inheritance: the member will be accessible from the code of the derived classes as well as from a code external to the class.
