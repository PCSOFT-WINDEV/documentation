## Reason
<a name="reason_ELTTEXTE000087"></a>
You are declaring a procedure by trying to give it two scope attributes.

**Reminder**: A procedure can only have a single scope attribute:

- Global: the procedure can be called in all the processes of the windows, controls and reports found in the project.

- Local (default value): the procedure can be called in the processes of the window (and its controls) where this procedure was created.

## Correction
<a name="correction_ELTTEXTE000111"></a>
Use a single scope attribute when declaring the procedure.

<a name="NOTE3"></a>
<a name="NOTE3_1"></a>
