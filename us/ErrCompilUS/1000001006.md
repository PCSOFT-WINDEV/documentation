<a name="NOTE1"></a>
<a name="NOTE1_1"></a>


## Reason
<a name="reason_ELTTEXTE000096"></a>
You are trying to access a member of the class with the syntax used to access a global member.


You are using the following syntax:



```wl
ClassName::MemberName
```


This syntax cannot be used to access a non-global member.

<a name="NOTE2"></a>
<a name="NOTE2_1"></a>


## Correction
<a name="correction_ELTTEXTE000120"></a>
Use the proper syntax to access a non-global member of the class:


```wl
ClassName:MemberName
```


<a name="NOTE3"></a>
<a name="NOTE3_1"></a>

```



**Possible correction**

Use the correct syntax.


```wl
Drawing:BaseColor
```
