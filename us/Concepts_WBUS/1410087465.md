**1. Enhance the style of your home page.**

The home page is a major element of your site. In some sites, it is just a connection page but in most Internet sites, this is truly the main page for attracting visitors (and future customer of the site). You should pay special attention to its content and presentation. You can read more documentation on how to create user-friendly websites.

**2. Contact us**

When users visit a site, they must be able to contact the person or the company in charge of the site: provide the information that will allow users to contact you: name, mailing address, email address, etc.

This page shows a map with the location of the headquarters or store, opening times, etc.

**3. Is the page content too long? Give the user ways to go back to the top of the page**.

If the content of your pages is too long, use buttons or links to go back to the top of the page (to avoid using the scrollbar).

**4. Set the style and alignment of your buttons**.

Make sure your buttons use the same style, and check their alignment. The page editor includes a snap-on and alignment mechanism to simplify this task.

**5. Avoid using framesets**.

Framesets, even though they seem to be more efficient at first, have specific problems: they include several pages. They are not as SEO-friendly. It is also more difficult for the users to navigate through your website (especially with the back button). Today, it is not recommended to use framesets when developing sites.

**6. Are there lists containing more than 20 elements? Use several pages to list the elements**.

You can use a Pager control to navigate between pages without writing code. This will allow for a cleaner interface. Your website will be faster and more user-friendly.

**7. Use images at 100% or in Homothetic centered mode**.

To keep the proportions of your images, it is recommended to choose:

- images at 100% (for static and dynamic images or if the image is the same size as the control).

- images in homothetic centered mode (for generated images or images of different sizes from a database): the size of the image will adapt to the area defined for the image. The proportions will be preserved.

| Image at 100 % if the control dimensions<br> <br>correspond to those of the image, <br>otherwise, Homothetic image | Stretched image<br>(not recommended) |

Selecting the display mode in the editor 
(Image control description, "General" tab)

**8. Are you using images? Make sure they are displayed properly in your pages**.

If a display problem occurs, check whether:

- the image exists, 

- the image is saved in a format recognized by the browser (GIF or JPG, for example), 

- the image is stored in the subdirectory of the &lt;ProjectName&gt;_WEB project.




**9. The user must type a quantity? Use a Combo Box control to simplify the input of quantities**.

**10. Does your site include a product catalog and order management system?**

Specify all the product details (name, reference, price, etc.), including a button or link to order the product, add it to a custom selection, add it to the cart, etc.
