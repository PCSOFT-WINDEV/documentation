HFSQL Cluster is an extension of the HFSQL Client/Server database model. In a database cluster, all HFSQL servers contain a copy of the databases and are synchronized in real time.

- The read load can be balanced across multiple servers.

- You can make changes to the physical configuration without interruptions on client computers.

- If one of the servers crashes, the client is automatically redirected to an operating server.
