Project configurations are used to easily define the different "targets" of your project. Several sites, libraries or components can be defined for the same project.

To generate the result of each configuration, you can select each configuration one by one and generate the corresponding element.

There is a faster method: **the multiple generation**. The configurations to be generated are selected in a single operation and the result is obtained immediately.

To start a multiple generation, go to the "Project" tab, "Generation" group, expand "Generate configuration" and select "Multiple generation".
