Websites can be viewed on several platforms: mobiles, tablets, PCs, ... Depending on the device, the size of the browser and the space used to display data can be different.

The "Responsive Web Design" method consists in creating a single page that automatically adapts according to the platform used.

## Method used
<a name="method_used_ELTTEXTE000150"></a>
WEBDEV uses the "Desktop first" method: developers must create the interface of their Website in "Desktop" mode. Then, they can create the version in "Tablet" mode, and finally, in "Mobile" mode.

In terms of design, a website is developed for "desktop" use first. When reducing the display resolutions (page size), the content and the features are moved, resized or hidden.

In the WEBDEV editor, the different resolutions are represented by slices. A slice represents a browser size for a specific device. WEBDEV includes 3 slices:

- The Mobile slice, which corresponds to smartphones.

- The Tablet slice, which corresponds to tablets.

- The Desktop slice, which corresponds to PCs, MACs, etc.
