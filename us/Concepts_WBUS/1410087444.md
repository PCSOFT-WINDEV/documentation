Project configurations allow you to adapt the same project to multiple "targets".

From the same project, you can create:

- sites with different elements, names, etc.

- different components, 

- a Webservice.




You can work on a specific configuration at any time: the elements that do not belong to this configuration will be grayed out in the project editor.

The multiple generation allows you to generate all project configurations (or some of them) in a single operation.
