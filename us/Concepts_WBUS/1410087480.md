WEBDEV includes a debugger to help you optimize your code.

The debugger allows you to run your dynamic sites step by step, by viewing the WLanguage code run, the content of variables, etc.

**To start the debugger, use**:

- ***breakpoints in the code editor***: the debugger will be automatically started when the line preceded by a breakpoint is run.
	To insert a breakpoint, simply click to the left of the line of code: a red dot appears.

- ***the WLanguage STOP server keyword in your WLanguage code***: the debugger will start automatically when this line of code is run.

- ***the "Debug project" option***: the debugger is started when running the test of the dynamic site. On the "Project" tab, in the "Test mode" group, expand Test mode and select "Debug project".
