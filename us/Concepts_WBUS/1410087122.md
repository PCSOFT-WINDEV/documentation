WEBDEV allows you to create Popup pages. Popup pages allow to interact with the user in a simple way.

A Popup page is associated with a page. A page can have several Popup pages.

Using Popups allows you to handle the dialog window in the editor like a different element of the page, while being included in the page.

In the editor:
