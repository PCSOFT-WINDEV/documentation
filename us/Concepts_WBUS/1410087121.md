WEBDEV allows you to create page templates. A template contains elements common to a set of site pages

The changes made to the page template are automatically applied to all the pages that use this template.

A page template allows you to use the style book defined for a site.

To create a page based on a template, select the template that will be used when creating the page.

**Remark**: The programming associated with the template elements can be performed in the template directly.

The characteristics of the elements can be dissociated from the template. For example, dissociate the position of a control from the template to move it elsewhere while keeping other changes (code, style, etc.). This is referred to as **inheritance**. In this case, the elements are identified by a blue square.
