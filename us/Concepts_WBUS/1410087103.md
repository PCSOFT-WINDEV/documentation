A website is a set of HTML (HyperText Markup Language) pages stored on a Web server. These HTML pages are organized for a specific purpose (present a company, sell products, etc.). 

A site is intended to be used by Internet users. Internet users use a simple browser to access the site.

WEBDEV allows you to easily create websites with or without data.
