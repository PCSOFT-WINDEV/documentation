The development of a **website** with WEBDEV is based on two main elements: the Project and the Analysis.

A **WEBDEV Project** is a set of elements (pages, reports, controls, classes, components, etc.), which put together, make it possible to create a website.

A **WEBDEV Analysis** is the database schema of the application. The analysis contains the different data files (tables) used by the site.

A site is built from a project.

In most cases, a project is associated with an analysis.

An analysis can be associated with one or more projects.
