In a website, emails make it possible to:

- simplify communication between users: send emails to the website manager, use a mailing list, etc.

- validate an order: in a business website, an email is sent to the customers to validate their orders.

- transfer data from one computer to another: the new orders entered in a business website are transferred by email to the company headquarters, etc.




WEBVED includes two methods to send emails from a website.

## 1. Sending emails from the user's computer
<a name="1_sending_emails_from_the_users_computer_ELTTEXTE000148"></a>
**Use this method when the user must send an email to a specific address: site's webmaster, technical support, sales department, etc.**

[EmailOpenMail](../WDLang2/3032021.md) opens the user's email program. Some parameters can be set as default: email address of the recipient, etc.

This method allows you to use the user's email program: no specific process is required in the WEBDEV site.

## 2. Sending emails from the server (Session pages or Active WEBDEV Pages only)
<a name="2_sending_emails_from_the_server_session_pages_active_webdev_pages_only_ELTTEXTE000172"></a>
In this case, the server manages the emails.

The emails can be sent:

- in the WEBDEV website directly (for an email data transfer, or for an order confirmation email, for example);

- by the email spooler (provided with WEBDEV).

Use this method to customize the sending of emails:

- checking the content of emails sent by the users (mailing website),

- checking the validity of the recipient's address,

- encrypting the information sent by email, 

- validating a process, etc.
