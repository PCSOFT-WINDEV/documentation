Multiple tools are available to test a WEBDEV site:

- WEBDEV's main editor.

- the WEBDEV administrator.
	This module is required to run a dynamic WEBDEV site (in Session mode or in AWP mode). On the development computer, dynamic sites can be tested using a test page created by the administrator.

- WDTestSite, load test tool.




The table below presents how and when these test modes must be used.

| Test mode | Type of test | Running the test |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Editor | Running the test from the editor allows you to test:<br><br>- the site features, <br><br>- the code used in the different events and processes. A powerful debugger allows you to monitor the execution of different events and processes.<br><br>- the use of the site with different browsers (installed on the development computer).<br><br><br><br><br>This type of test: <br><br>- allows you to use the debugger.<br><br>- is taken into account by the "Code Coverage".<br><br><br> | <br><br>- On the "Project" tab, in the "Test mode" group, expand "Test mode" and select "Debug project".<br><br>- On the "Project" tab, in the "Test mode" group, expand "Test mode" and select "Debug project from the home page".<br><br><br><br><br>The rights granted to the user (access, write and read rights) correspond to the rights granted to the developer. |
| WEBDEV administrator<br><br>(dynamic WEBDEV site only) | Running the test from the administrator allows you to test:<br><br>- the site features, <br><br>- Web-specific features (cookies, etc.), <br><br>- the use of the site in real conditions.<br><br><br> | Start the WEBDEV administrator ("Start" menu) and click the "Test page" button ("Advanced" tab).<br><br>This test allows you to use the WEBDEV site as a real user.<br><br>The rights granted to the user (access, write and read) correspond to the rights granted to the default user defined in the Web server used. |
| WDTestSite<br><br>(dynamic WEBDEV site only) | WDTestSite runs load tests.<br><br>WDTestSite is used to start multiple simultaneous connections to a WEBDEV site.<br><br>Each connection performs a set of actions in the WEBDEV site (preset scenario). <br><br>This test must be run on a ready-to-use WEBDEV site installed on a deployment computer. | <br><br>1. Create a test scenario (with WDTestSite).<br><br>2. Install WDTestSite and the scenario on different computers to simulate a large number of accesses.<br><br>3. Specify the number of connections to establish.<br><br>4. Run the test scenario on each computer.<br><br><br><br><br>Remarks:<br><br>- Each computer establishes a defined number of connections. <br><br>- Each connection performs the selected scenario.<br><br><br> |
| Automated tests | Automated tests are used to test procedures and classes of a site at different levels of development.<br><br>The test scenarios are generated in WLanguage from the procedure test or from the class test. The scenarios can be modified in the code editor.<br><br>This type of test is taken into account by the "Code Coverage". | <br><br>1. Go to the procedure or the class in the "Project explorer" pane.<br><br>2. Right-click to open the context menu of the element and select "Create a unit test".<br><br><br> |
