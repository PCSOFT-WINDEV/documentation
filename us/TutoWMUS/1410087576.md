## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000331"></a>
That's it, our application is complete. To test it, we must compile it and install it on the device.

We will see how to deploy the application to Android and iOS.. |   |   |   |

## Generating the Android application
<a name="generating_the_android_application_ELTTEXTE000373"></a>


- To generate the Android application:

	1. If necessary, select the Android platform in the "Project explorer" pane.

	2. On the "Project" tab, in the "Generation" group, click "Generate" (you can also click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_Generation_Android.gif)
 in the quick access buttons).

	3. The Android application generation wizard starts.

	4. If necessary, select the first window of the application (WIN_Menu, for example) and validate. 

	5. The first step of the wizard is to select the application generation mode. The generation format may change depending on the mode selected. 
			For this tutorial, select "Generate for free deployment (Private Store, fleet of devices, etc.)". Go to the next step. 

	6. The next step of the wizard is to check the tools needed to generate the Android application.
![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P2_WM%20-%20Mon%20Premier%20Projet%20-%20HC%20N%B0007.jpg&type=thumb)
The wizard prompts you to:

		- **Download and automatically install the Android SDK and Gradle**: in this case, you will only have to validate the license. WINDEV Mobile takes care of everything. If an update is available, the generation wizard will prompt you to perform the necessary updates. Only an Internet connection is required.

		- **Use the tools automatically installed**. This option is available if the tools have been downloaded and installed during a previous generation.

		- **Specify the location of the tools already installed on your computer**. In this case, you just need to specify the installation paths of Gradle and the Android SDK.




7. Select the option corresponding to your configuration and go to the next step. 
			Remark: If you have chosen to download and install the tools, going to the next step may be quite long and you may have to validate the license. 

8. Go to the next step by clicking the arrows at the bottom of the wizard. The next step of the wizard allows you to:

	- define the application name (displayed below the icon used to start the application) and the corresponding package.

	- select the application icon in the WINDEV Mobile image catalog ("stock" in the "Flat Soft" theme for example). 

	- define the email address used by default to send an error report if necessary.

Connect the device to the development computer. <br><br>2. In the explorer, open the generation directory of the apk file corresponding to the Android application: on the "Home" tab, in the "General" group, expand ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_Rep_Projet.gif)<br> and select "Browse generation directory". <br><br>3. Copy the apk file into the "Download" directory of device. <br><br>4. Unplug the device. <br><br>5. Start the application for file management on the device. <br><br>6. Go to the "Download" directory and run the apk file. The application is automatically installed.<br><br><br> |

- To generate the iOS application:

	1. If necessary, select the iOS platform in the "Project explorer" pane. 

	2. On the "Project" tab, in the "Generation" group, click "Generate" (you can also click ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=ICO_Generation_iOS_WM_GAF.jpg)
 in the quick access buttons).

	3. If necessary, select the first window of the application (WIN_Menu, for example) and validate. 

	4. The iOS application generation wizard starts.

	5. The wizard is used to:

		- define the application name, the company and the copyright.

		- enter the Bundle ID.

| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png)<br> | Note | This ID is a unique identifier for Apple applications. It is defined and registered on the Apple developer account.<br><br>This identifier will allow you to register your application so that it can be tested and deployed. By default, WINDEV Mobile automatically generates an identifier that meets Apple's development requirements. You can change this ID. |





		- define the email address used by default to send an error report if necessary.

### Transferring the WINDEV Mobile project to the Mac
<a name="transferring_the_windev_mobile_project_the_mac_ELTPARAGRAPHE000229"></a>

- To transfer the WINDEV Mobile project to the Mac:

	1. Copy the entire folder generated in the EXE directory to an external location (USB drive, external hard disk, directory shared with the Mac on the network). The name of this directory is &lt;Project name&gt;.xcode.gen. 

	2. Paste this folder on the Mac that will compile the application.

	3. Open the folder on the Mac and open the "Project_name.xcodeproj" file.

	4. The project is opened in Xcode. 








### Compiling the project in Xcode
<a name="compiling_the_project_xcode_ELTPARAGRAPHE000239"></a>

WINDEV Mobile automatically generates an Xcode project for your iOS compilations. To simplify the implementation of applications, WINDEV Mobile generates a “Scheme” for Xcode. 



- To compile the project in Xcode:

	1. Select the compilation options from the drop-down list in the upper-left corner. Select the scheme corresponding to your application then the compilation target (device currently connected or a simulator). 

	2. To start the compilation, select "Product .. Clean" then "Product .. Build". 

	3. A compilation status report appears at the top ("Succeeded", or the number of warnings and errors). You can click these symbols to see the list of errors/warnings.

	4. Once the program has been compiled without errors, you can start the simulation (select "Product .. Run"). The simulation window appears with the application.





You can then test your application directly on your iPhone or iPad.
