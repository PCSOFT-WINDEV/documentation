**The tutorial is over now!**

This course covered a range of topics, but not all WINDEV Mobile features, far from it!

You are now familiar with the main concepts.

We recommend that you spend another day exploring the menu options of WINDEV Mobile, for each module.

You can also explore the examples provided with WINDEV Mobile: some are simple and only address one topic, while others are more complex. These examples will show you the different aspects of WINDEV Mobile as well as the development on different platforms. Reading the source code is also a good way to learn.

It would take too much time to discuss all available topics (there are hundreds, even thousands!). WINDEV Mobile has many features that have not been covered in this tutorial:

- email management

- simple queries and queries with parameters

- notifications, and more




For more details, see the online help.



We hope you enjoy developing with **WINDEV Mobile 28**!
