## Tutorial overview
<a name="tutorial_overview_ELTTEXTE000274"></a>
The tutorial has been designed to help you develop on the main mobile platforms:

- Android.

- iOS (iPhone/iPad).




This tutorial is divided into the following sections: 

- [Part 1: WINDEV Mobile overview](../TutoWM/1410087562.md). 

- [Part 2: Create and deploy a first Android/iOS application](../TutoWM/1410087563.md).

- [Part 3: WLanguage main concepts](../TutoWM/1410087569.md). 

- [Part 4: Create a data management application for Android and iOS](../TutoWM/1410087571.md). This part is common to Android and iOS and allows you to create management windows for these two platforms.




This tutorial has been designed to progressively teach you how to use WINDEV Mobile. By following this tutorial:

- you will discover the main concepts explained informally; these are the concepts you should learn and understand.

- you will also be asked to perform operations that illustrate the concepts just explained.


As you progress through the tutorial, if you want to take a closer look at a concept or if you want to get more details about a programming function, see the online help (accessible from the editors).

The size of a lesson is not necessarily proportional to its relevance.

**And don't forget to take a look at the examples provided with WINDEV Mobile: they are very instructive!**

## How to access the online help?
<a name="how_access_the_online_help_ELTTEXTE000340"></a>
The WINDEV Mobile online help allows you to get detailed information about the 3700 WLanguage functions. The online help also contains help for editors, controls, tips and more.

The online help is available at any time in WINDEV Mobile:

- In the code editor, a specific help is available for each function via the F1 key.

- In WINDEV Mobile, each dialog box contains a ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=P0_BTN_Aide.jpg)
 button that opens the corresponding help page.

- The help menu of the editors ("Help" option on the "Home" tab, in the "Online help" group of the WINDEV Mobile menu) allows you to start the online help.




- The help can be displayed:

	- in an Internet browser, if you have Internet access:

| ![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=3&name=note.png)<br> | Note | It is recommended to check the online help rather than the local help. The online help is updated on a regular basis.<br><br>The WINDEV, WEBDEV and WINDEV Mobile online help is available from any computer with Internet access. The IDEs do not need to be installed.<br><br>Users can add comments on the documentation pages: personal notes, examples, links and more. |





**Remark: To open the local help from the editor**:

1. On the "Home" tab, in the "Environment" group, expand "Options" and select "General options of WINDEV Mobile".

2. In the "Help" tab, select:

	- the access mode to the help database.

## What is WINDEV Mobile used for?
<a name="what_windev_mobile_used_for_ELTTEXTE000406"></a>
WINDEV Mobile is a DevOps Integrated Development Environment. It allows you to develop applications in many fields:

- Management of stocks.

- Inventories, tracking of goods.

- Adjustment and monitoring of machines on an assembly line.

- Taking orders for fast processing in a temporary outlet (fairs, schools, booth, etc.).

- Customer forms.

- Help with making snap decisions on a cell phone.

- Checking the identity of visitors at an event: exhibition, product showcase, etc.

- On-call doctors or vets.

- Taking information in a temporary outlet: trade fair, street poll, stadium, etc.

- Heavy equipment rental (tools, vehicles, etc.).

- ...




WINDEV Mobile is a development environment that includes all tools required to develop an application.

Unlike other programming languages, there is no need to find and add modules to be able to design, check and install an application.

You will be surprised by the simplicity of WLanguage, WINDEV Mobile's 5th Generation Language: a few hours are all you need to become familiar with it, a week is usually enough to fully master its potential!

No more programming hassle, WLanguage is available in English and French!
