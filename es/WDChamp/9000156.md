## Overview
<a name="overview_ELTTEXTE000226"></a>
The "Pull to refresh" feature allows the user to "pull" a Table control, a Looper control or a window in order to refresh its content.

During this action, a refresh bar automatically appears in the exposed area: 

- The bar indicates that you must pull to refresh. 

- It then indicates that you must release to refresh. 

- It also indicates that the refresh operation is in progress. A progress bar is displayed during the refresh operation. 

- The control is refreshed.

## Implementation

### Configuring the control or the window
<a name="configuring_the_control_the_window_ELTPARAGRAPHE000041"></a>

To use the "Pull-to-refresh" gesture: 

1. Open the control description window (Table or Looper) or window. 

2. In the "Details" tab of the description window of control, check "Refresh by pull/release".

3. Specify (if necessary) the internal window that will be used for "Pull to refresh". You can: 

	- use the native display of platform ("None" option).

	- use a preset window. In this case ("Preset window" option), WINDEV Mobile proposes to import a preset window. The internal window is immediately added into the current project and it is associated with the feature. This window can be customized if necessary.
			Remark: The internal window is named "IW_PULL_TO_REFRESH".




5. Validate (if necessary) the description window. 




The "Pull-to-refresh" configuration has added:  

- the refresh bar that will be displayed to the user during the operation. A refresh bar is proposed by default. If the customization was requested, this bar corresponds to an internal window added to the project for customization. 

- the "Refreshing by pull/release" event among the (Table or Looper) control or window events. This event is automatically called during the refresh gesture.





### Event "Refreshing by pull/release"
<a name="event_refreshing_pullrelease_ELTPARAGRAPHE000066"></a>

The event "Refreshing by pull/release" must contain the code for refreshing data: 

- in the Table or Looper control. 

- in the window. 


At the end of code execution, the refresh bar will be automatically hidden. 

Caution: The refresh bar displays a progress bar during the execution of the event "Refreshing by pull/release". This progress bar will be displayed only if the main thread can be run during the execution of "Refreshing by pull/release". To see the progress bar, you must perform the long refresh process (HTTP request or HFSQL browse for example) in a thread run from the event "Refreshing by pull/release". In this case, the bar must be managed by the following functions: 

- [TableRefreshVisible](../WDLang1/1000021196.md),

- [LooperRefreshVisible](../WDLang2/1000021195.md),

- [WinRefreshVisible](../WDLang1/1000023419.md).




**Special case: Browsing Table or Looper**
If "Pull to refresh" is enabled on a browsing looper or table, [TableDisplay](../WDLang1/3074003.md) or [LooperDisplay](../WDLang2/3083001.md) associated with the *taReExecuteQuery* constant will be automatically called at the end of "Refreshing by pull/release" (if it was triggered by a pull-to-refresh). 
To disable this behavior, you must return <u><u><u><u>False</u></u></u></u> in the event "Refreshing by pull/release". For more details, see [Event "Refreshing by pull/release": managing the bar](#NOTE3_2).

## Customizing the "Pull to refresh" feature

### Refresh bar
<a name="refresh_bar_ELTPARAGRAPHE000115"></a>

If a refresh bar is used, this bar corresponds to a specific internal window that can be included in the project for customization.

This internal window includes 3 planes displayed during the different steps of "Pull to refresh": 

- The first plane is displayed during the scroll, as long as the refresh bar is not entirely displayed. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=7&name=PullToRefresh1.gif)
This plane includes an image and a caption. This caption describes the action associated with the current gesture.

- The second plane is displayed during the scroll when the refresh bar is entirely displayed and as long as the user did not release the pointer. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=7&name=PullToRefresh1.gif)
This plane includes an image and a caption. This caption describes the action associated with the current gesture. When going from plane 1 to plane 2, the arrow changes direction and the caption becomes "Release to refresh". 

- The last plane is displayed during the data refresh. <br>![](https://doc.pcsoft.fr/en-US/images/image.awp?langid=7&name=PullToRefresh3.gif)
This plane includes a Progress Bar control and a caption. 




The proposed window contains three specific events to manage the "Pull to refresh" gesture: 

- "Pull to refresh: Start": This code is called when the "Pull to refresh" gesture is detected. By default, this event positions the internal window on plane 1 and modifies the caption of the action. 

- "Pull to refresh: Wait for release": This event is called when a refresh can be started. By default, this event positions the internal window on plane 2 and modifies the caption of the action. 

- "Pull to refresh: Refresh": This event is called when starting the refresh. By default, this event positions the internal window on plane 3 and modifies the caption of the action. 




When the internal window was included in the project, you can: 

- customize the bar interface. 

- customize the events for managing "Pull to refresh". 

- access the controls of internal window via the following syntax: 
	
	```txt
	<Name of Table or Looper control>.<Name of Internal Window>.<Control name>
	```

### Event "Refreshing by pull/release": managing the bar
<a name="event_refreshing_pullrelease_managing_the_bar_ELTPARAGRAPHE000148"></a>

This event can manage the control (or window) refresh in a specific thread. In this case, the bar display can be managed manually by the following functions: 

- [TableRefreshVisible](../WDLang1/1000021196.md),

- [LooperRefreshVisible](../WDLang2/1000021195.md),

- [WinRefreshVisible](../WDLang1/1000023419.md).




Example: The event "Refreshing by pull/release" of TABLE_Products runs the automatic procedure named ChangeReorder, once, with a 3-second delay. 


```wl
// Display the refresh bar
TableRefreshVisible(TABLE_Products, True)
// Automatic refresh procedure
ChangeReorder()
```
At the end of refresh procedure, the refresh bar is erased by using [TableRefreshVisible](../WDLang1/1000021196.md) again. 


```wl
PROCEDURE ChangeReorder()
IF NOT gbReorderPerformed THEN	
	FOR i = 1_TO_ TABLE_Products..Occurrence
		IF TABLE_Products[i].COL_ID = gnReorderProductID THEN
			TABLE_Products[i].COL_InStock = IMG_Stock_OK
		END
	END
END
// Delete the refresh bar
TableRefreshVisible(TABLE_Products, False)
```
Remark: To hide the bar, you must perform as many calls to [TableRefreshVisible](../WDLang1/1000021196.md)(False) as the number to calls to [TableRefreshVisible](../WDLang1/1000021196.md)(True).
