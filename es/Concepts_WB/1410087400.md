Los ejemplos proporcionados con WEBDEV tienen como objetivo ayudarle a aprender las características de WEBDEV.

Su código fuente es claro e incluye comentarios.

Con WEBDEV se proporcionan diferentes tipos de ejemplos:

- ejemplos completos: estos ejemplos corresponden a sitios completos que pueden ser utilizados sin ninguna adaptación.

- ejemplos didácticos: estos ejemplos ilustran una funcionalidad específica.

- ejemplos unitarios: estos ejemplos incluyen una Page que puede probarse fácilmente en el proyecto actual. Esta página presenta el uso de una función, grupo de funciones, control, etc.

- componentes: -Estos ejemplos incluyen una Component interna, una Component externa y un ejemplo de uso. 




Estos ejemplos y componentes pueden abrirse desde la ventana de inicio de WEBDEV.

- Si el ejemplo no está instalado en el equipo, se descargará (desde un servidor de PC SOFT) y abrirá automáticamente.

- Si el ejemplo está instalado en el equipo, se crea automáticamente un copy en "Mis proyectos\\Mis ejemplos".


El ejemplo abierto corresponde a la copia del ejemplo original. Esto le permite trabajar o hacer cambios en la copia. Así, es posible conservar el ejemplo original sin cambios. Cada vez que abra el ejemplo (con la opción "Abrir un ejemplo"), podrá trabajar en la copia o en la versión original.  

Puede encontrar más ejemplos en nuestro sitio web (www.windev.es).
